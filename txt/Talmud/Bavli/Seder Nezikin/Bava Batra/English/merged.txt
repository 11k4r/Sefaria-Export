<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Partners who wished to make a partition [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard build </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wall </span>for the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle </span>of the courtyard. What is this wall fashioned from? In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary to build </span>such a wall with <span class="gemarra-regular">non-chiseled stone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">evil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">chiseled stone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">azit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">small bricks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kefisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">large bricks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leveinim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], they must build </span>the wall with that material. <span class="gemarra-regular">Everything is in accordance with the regional </span><span class="gemarra-regular">custom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If they build the wall with <span class="gemarra-regular">non-chiseled stone, this </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">provide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three handbreadths </span>of his portion of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">provides three handbreadths, </span>since the thickness of such a wall is six handbreadths. If they build the wall with <span class="gemarra-regular">chiseled stone, this </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">provides two and a half handbreadths and that </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">provides two and a half handbreadths, </span>since such a wall is five handbreadths thick. If they build the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">with small bricks, this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides two handbreadths and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides two handbreadths, </span>since the thickness of such a wall is four handbreadths. If they build <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large bricks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides one and a half handbreadths and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides one and a half handbreadths, </span>since the thickness of such a wall is three handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if the wall </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">falls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the space </span>where the wall stood <span class="gemarra-regular">and the stones belong to both of them, </span>to be divided equally.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly with regard to a garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary to build a partition </span>in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>his neighbor to join in building the partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>an expanse of <span class="gemarra-regular">fields [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">babbika</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary not to build a partition </span>between two people’s fields, and one person wishes to build a partition between his field and that of his neighbor, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>his neighbor to build such a partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>one person <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes </span>to erect a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must withdraw into his own </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">and build </span>the partition there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he makes </span>a border <span class="gemarra-regular">mark on the outer side </span>of the barrier facing his neighbor’s property, indicating that he built the entire structure of his own materials and on his own land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if the wall </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">falls, </span>the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the space </span>where the wall stood <span class="gemarra-regular">and the stones </span>belong only <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>as is indicated by the mark on the wall.
Nevertheless, in a place where it is not customary to build a partition between two people’s fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they made </span>such a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">with the agreement of the two of them, they build it in the middle, </span>i.e., on the property line, <span class="gemarra-regular">and make </span>a border <span class="gemarra-regular">mark on the one </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and on the other </span>side. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if the wall </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">falls, </span>the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the space </span>where the wall stood <span class="gemarra-regular">and the stones </span>belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to both of them, </span>to be divided equally.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages initially <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed: What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitza</span> mentioned in the mishna? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Consider the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitzat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> which separates the vineyard from a field of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached, </span>resulting, if the situation is not rectified, in the grain and grapes becoming items from which deriving benefit is prohibited due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard. The owner of the field of grain may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the vineyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Build a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> between the vineyard and the field of grain. If the owner of the vineyard did so, and the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached again, </span>the owner of the field of grain may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> again: <span class="gemarra-regular">Build a partition. </span>

Daf 2b

If the owner of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">neglecte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to make the necessary repairs <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">build a partition </span>between the fields, the grain and grapes are <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is liable for the </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">loss. </span>He must compensate the owner of the grain for the damage suffered, as it is the vineyard owner’s fault that deriving benefit from the grain is now prohibited.
According to the understanding that the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means a partition, one can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that they build a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is that they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wished </span>to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if they did not </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>the reluctant partner to build such a wall, although his neighbor objects to the fact that the partner can see what he is doing in his courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight, </span>that is, the discomfort suffered by someone because he is exposed to the gaze of others while he is in his own private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called damage.</span>
The Gemara objects to this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitza</span> used in the mishna means <span class="gemarra-regular">a division, as it is written: “And the division of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥetzat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the congregation was” </span>(Numbers 31:43), referring to the half of the spoil that belonged to the entire congregation. According to this interpretation the mishna means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since they wished </span>to divide the jointly owned courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">they build </span>a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>in the center even <span class="gemarra-regular">against the will </span>of one of the partners. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight is called damage.</span>
The Gemara rejects this line of reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means a division, the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who wished to make a division, </span>are imprecise, as the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: Who wished to divide. Rather, what </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">A partition. </span>The Gemara retorts: If so, the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">They build the wall, </span>are imprecise, as the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: They build it, </span>since the wall and the partition are one and the same. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>They build <span class="gemarra-regular">it, I would say that a mere partition of pegs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bimseifas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> would suffice. He therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that they build an actual <span class="gemarra-regular">wall, </span>all in accordance with the regional custom.
The mishna teaches: Partners who wished to make a partition in a jointly owned courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">build the wall </span>for the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle </span>of the courtyard. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if they agree to build a wall it should be built in the middle? Why should one of them contribute more than the other?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span>of the partners <span class="gemarra-regular">went ahea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and convinced the other </span>that they should build a partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the second <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the first when the latter comes to begin construction: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I was persuaded by you </span>to build a partition, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the airspace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> I agreed to the erection of a minimal barrier that would result in a loss of open space in the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But I was not persuaded by you with regard to the use </span>of the courtyard. I did not agree to forfeit any usable space on the ground in my share of the courtyard for the building of a wall. To counter this, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that since they agreed to make a partition, they must each contribute a part of the courtyard for the building of the wall.
§ After having determined that the wording of the mishna is unproblematic only if the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means a wall, it follows that damage caused by sight is not called damage. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">not called damage? </span>The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> for the proofs, which follow, that challenge this assumption: <span class="gemarra-regular">Garden, wall, compels, and they divide, windows, as Rav Naḥman.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which the mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly with regard to a garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in a place where it is customary to build a partition in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court obligates his neighbor to join in building the partition. This indicates that invading one’s privacy by looking at him while he is in his private domain is called damage.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A garden is differen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing invasion of privacy, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for a person to stan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in another’s field </span>and look at his crop <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">is standing, </span>because he casts an evil eye upon it and thereby causes him damage, and the same is true for a garden. Since the issue in this case is damage resulting from the evil eye, no proof can be brought with regard to the matter of damage caused by sight.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And similarly </span>with regard to a garden, which suggests that a garden and a courtyard are governed by the same rationale. The Gemara answers: The term: And similarly, is stated not with regard to the reason for the obligation to construct a wall, but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">non-chiseled and chiseled stones.</span> A partition in a garden is built with the same materials used for the building of a wall in a courtyard, in accordance with regional custom.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (5a): In the case of a dividing <span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>in a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard that fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if one of the owners wishes to rebuild the wall, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>the other owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to build </span>the wall with him again <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>This indicates that damage caused by sight is called damage. The Gemara rejects this proof: The case of a wall that <span class="gemarra-regular">fell is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> since a wall had already stood there, the court compels the owners to rebuild it as it was.
The Gemara expresses its astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he who asked </span>the question, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did he ask it </span>at all? The mishna is clearly referring to a wall that has fallen, which means that the joint owners have already agreed in the past to build a partition between their respective portions. The Gemara answers: He who asked the question maintains that the joint owners can be compelled to build a wall even in a case where a wall had not stood there before, to prevent any invasion of privacy. And the mishna does not address the case of a wall that fell to teach that only in such a case is there an obligation to build a wall. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which states that even in a case where there had previously been a high wall the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him </span>to rebuild it <span class="gemarra-regular">higher than four cubits, </span>because once there is a wall of four cubits there is no further invasion of privacy.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an additional proof that damage caused by sight is called damage, from what is taught in a mishna (7b): The residents of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>financially participate in the <span class="gemarra-regular">building of a gatehouse and a door to the </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>so that the courtyard not be open to the eyes of those standing in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight is called damage. </span>The Gemara answers: This is not a proof to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of two neighbors, as the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>of being exposed to the gaze <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the general <span class="gemarra-regular">public, </span>which has unimpeded sight of what is happening in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>and certainly called damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>exposure to the sight of <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual not </span>considered damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that it is called damage from what is taught in a mishna (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One divides a courtyard </span>at the request of one of the co-owners <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if its area is sufficient so <span class="gemarra-regular">that there will be in it four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits for this one and four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits for that one, </span>that is, the same minimal dimensions for each of the co-owners. This means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is enough for this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and enough for that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do divide </span>the courtyard at the request of one of the owners. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>so that the courtyard must be divided <span class="gemarra-regular">with a wall </span>that will prevent one neighbor from seeing the other? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps it is divided <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mere partition of pegs </span>through which one can still see.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof that damage caused by sight is called damage from what is taught in a mishna (22a): One who desires to build a wall opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">the windows </span>of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from the windows, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether above, below, or opposite. And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught with regard to </span>that mishna: Concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>the wall must be high <span class="gemarra-regular">enough so that one cannot peer </span>into the window <span class="gemarra-regular">and see </span>into the window; concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>the wall must be low <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>on top of it <span class="gemarra-regular">and see </span>into the window; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite, </span>one must distance the wall from the windows <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it will not darken </span>his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window. This indicates that there is a concern about the damage caused by exposure to the gaze of others.
The Gemara rejects this argument: The <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>of being exposed to the sight of others while <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>one’s own <span class="gemarra-regular">house is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as people engage in activities in their homes that they do not want others to see. By contrast, a courtyard is out in the open and it is possible that the residents are indifferent to being observed.
The Gemara challenges this distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">roof is adjacent to another’s courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he must make a parapet </span>around the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits high </span>so that he will not be able to see into his neighbor’s courtyard. This indicates that the damage of being exposed to the eyes of others even in a courtyard is called damage. The Gemara refutes this proof: The situation <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, as the owner of the courtyard can say to the owner of the roof: I </span>make <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">on a regular </span>basis. <span class="gemarra-regular">You, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>make <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">on a regular </span>basis, but only infrequently. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know when you will go up </span>to the roof, 

Daf 3a

<span class="gemarra-regular">so that I can hide from you </span>at that time and avoid coming under your gaze.
§ The Gemara has so far presented one version of the discussion of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">A different version relates </span>the discussion as follows: The Sages initially <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed: What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitza</span> mentioned in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">A division, </span>not a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And the division of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥetzat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the congregation was” </span>(Numbers 31:43). According to this interpretation, the mishna means to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since they wished </span>to divide the jointly owned courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">they buil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>in the center even <span class="gemarra-regular">against the will </span>of one of the partners. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight is called damage.</span>
The Gemara objects to this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say: What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitza</span> mentioned in the mishna? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition. </span>This usage would be <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Consider the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥitzat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a vineyard </span>which separates the vineyard from a field of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached, </span>resulting, if the situation is not rectified, in the grain and grapes becoming items from which deriving benefit is prohibited. The owner of the field of grain may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the vineyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Build a partition </span>between the vineyard and the field of grain. If the owner of the vineyard did so, and the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached again, </span>the owner of the field of grain may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>again: <span class="gemarra-regular">Build a partition. </span>If the owner of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">neglected </span>to make the necessary repairs <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">build a partition </span>between the fields, the grain and grapes are <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered forbidden </span>due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is liable for the </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">loss.</span>
The Gemara concludes stating the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the understanding that the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means a partition, one can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that they build a wall is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wished </span>to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if they did not </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>the reluctant partner to build such a wall, although his neighbor objects to the fact that the partner can see what he is doing in his courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight is not called damage.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span> the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">They build the wall, </span>are imprecise, as the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: They build it, </span>since the wall and the partition are one and the same. The Gemara retorts: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">A division. If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the term <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means a division, the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who wished to make a division, </span>are imprecise, as the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: Who wished to divide. </span>The Gemara answers: The phrasing of the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">as people </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Come, let us make a division. </span>Consequently, the mishna can also be understood as referring to two people who wished to divide a jointly owned area.
The Gemara asks, according to the understanding that <span class="it-text">meḥitza</span> means division: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight is called damage, why </span>does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wish, </span>they build a wall? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if they did not </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so, it should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be possible to compel the reluctant party to build a wall between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Our mishna </span>is referring to a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division. </span>Joint owners of a courtyard cannot be compelled to divide the courtyard unless each party will receive at least four square cubits of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling of the mishna applies only in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wished </span>to divide the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: According to this understanding, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>Is he teaching us <span class="gemarra-regular">that when </span>a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division, if they </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">wished </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>it? But <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this in the latter clause of a different mishna (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the joint owners <span class="gemarra-regular">do not both wish </span>to divide it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when both of them wish </span>to divide it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">smaller than this, </span>i.e., smaller than four square cubits for each party. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>we had learned this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, I would say </span>that they divide the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">smaller than this by </span>constructing <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere partition of pegs, </span>which does not prevent invasion of privacy. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us here </span>in this mishna that if they wish to divide the courtyard they can be compelled to build a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">wall.</span>
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach this </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and not teach that </span>other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary for </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to teach the other mishna to introduce <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of that mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings </span>that are contained in a single scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be divided even if both </span>owners <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so.
The Gemara brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a different version </span>of the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they wished </span>to divide the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? </span>What forces them to build the wall? If one of the parties does not wish to build a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him retract. Rav Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that the mishna is not discussing a case where they merely reached a verbal agreement to divide the courtyard, but rather with a case where each party <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither side can retract.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather than teaching us </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division, but </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">they wished </span>to divide it, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division, even if they did not </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to divide it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had it taught us </span>only a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they did not </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to divide it, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that in a case where the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">wished </span>to divide it, if one of the parties does not wish to build a proper wall he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be compelled to do so. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he is compelled to participate.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But how can you say this? Doesn’t the latter clause </span>of the mishna (11a) <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: When </span>do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <span class="gemarra-regular">When the </span>joint owners <span class="gemarra-regular">do not both wish </span>to divide it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when both of them wish </span>to divide it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>it even if it is smaller than this. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is this clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fact that either one can force the other to build a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">wall? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere partition of pegs </span>and not to an actual wall.
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach this </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and not teach that </span>other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach the other mishna for <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of that mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings </span>that are contained in a single scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be divided even if both </span>owners <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so. This concludes the alternative version of the discussion.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">did you interpret the mishna </span>to be referring? To a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wished </span>to divide the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it; </span>how can either one force the other to build a wall? If the parties no longer want to build a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them retract. Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is referring to a case where each party <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither party can retract.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>each party <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is merely a verbal acquisition, </span>meaning there was no actual transfer of property, but only a verbal agreement to act in a certain manner in the future and not a true act of acquisition. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They performed </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to directions, </span>i.e., not only did they verbally agree to divide the courtyard, they also determined which of them would get which part of the courtyard. Consequently, the acquisition related to actual property, a particular plot of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: For example, this one walke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through his </span>designated portion and <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an act demonstrating ownershi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one walked through his </span>designated portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and performed an act demonstrating ownership </span>there.
§ The mishna teaches: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary to build </span>such a wall with non-chiseled stone [<span class="it-text">g</span><span class="it-text">evil</span>], or chiseled stone [<span class="it-text">g</span><span class="it-text">azit</span>], or small bricks [<span class="it-text">kefisin</span>], or large bricks [<span class="it-text">leveinim</span>], they must build the wall with that material. The Gemara identifies the various building materials: <span class="gemarra-italic">Gevi</span><span class="gemarra-italic">l</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are not planed. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Gazi</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are planed, as it is written: “All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of chiseled stones </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gazit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>sawed with saws, within and without” (I Kings 7:9). This teaches that chiseled stones are those that have been planed and smoothened. <span class="gemarra-italic">Kefisin</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">small bricks. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Leveinim</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">large bricks.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, the son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: From where </span>do you know <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gevil</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are not planed, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and this extra handbreadth </span>that a wall of <span class="it-text">gevil</span> has compared to what a wall of <span class="it-text">gazit</span> has is <span class="gemarra-regular">for the protruding edges? </span>That is, a wall of <span class="it-text">gevil</span> is six handbreadths thick because the stones have not been planed and smoothened, and therefore protrude somewhat outward. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span><span class="it-text">gevil</span> refers to planed stones that <span class="gemarra-regular">are half </span>the thickness <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gazit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>namely, just two and a half handbreadths, as compared to <span class="it-text">gazit</span>, which is five handbreadths thick; <span class="gemarra-regular">and this extra handbreadth </span>in a wall of <span class="it-text">gevil</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>for the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">rows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">urbei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, a wall of <span class="it-text">gevil</span> is actually two walls of planed stones that are each two and a half handbreadths thick; and the two walls are separated by one handbreadth, which is later filled in with mortar for added strength.
A proof for this explanation can be brought from <span class="gemarra-regular">what we say, </span>i.e., that <span class="gemarra-italic">kefisin</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">small bricks, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-italic">leveinim</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">large bricks, </span>twice the thickness of small bricks. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this extra handbreadth </span>of thickness that a wall of <span class="it-text">kefisin</span> has compared to what a wall of <span class="it-text">levinim</span> has is for the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">rows </span>of small bricks.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-italic">kefisin</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">small bricks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this as a tradition. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, they learned as a tradition </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">gevil</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refers to non-planed stones.</span>
The Gemara presents a different version of the discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From where </span>do you know <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kefisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are small bricks, </span>one-half the width of large bricks, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this extra handbreadth </span>of thickness that a wall of <span class="it-text">kefisin</span> has compared to what a wall of <span class="it-text">leveinim</span> has covers the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">rows </span>of <span class="it-text">kefisin</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>you should say <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>are <span class="gemarra-italic">kefisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Stones that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not planed, and this extra handbreadth </span>of thickness that a wall of <span class="it-text">kefisin</span> has in comparison to what a wall of <span class="it-text">leveinim</span> has <span class="gemarra-regular">is for the protruding edges. </span>And proof for this explanation can be brought from <span class="gemarra-regular">what we say, </span>i.e., that <span class="gemarra-italic">gevil</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not planed, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-italic">gazit</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">planed stones, and this extra handbreadth </span>of thickness that a wall of <span class="it-text">gevil</span> has compared to what a wall of <span class="it-text">gazit</span> has <span class="gemarra-regular">is for the protruding edges.</span>
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-italic">gevil</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are stones that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not planed? Rather, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">as a tradition. Here too, they learned as a tradition </span>that <span class="it-text">kefisin</span> are small bricks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that the space left <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">rows </span>of a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is always a handbreadth. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter </span>applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <span class="gemarra-regular">with mortar. But </span>when they are filled in <span class="gemarra-regular">with gravel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">berikhsa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">is required. And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <span class="gemarra-regular">with gravel. But when mortar </span>is used to fill in the space, <span class="gemarra-regular">not as much </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">is required, </span>and less than a handbreadth suffices.
§ The Gemara asks: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>in the case of a wall of <span class="gemarra-regular">chiseled stone, if for every four cubits of height there are five </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of thickness </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">will stand, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if not it will not stand, </span>as this is the required ratio between a wall’s height and its thickness? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t there </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one-cubit-thick wall separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary of the Temple [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amah</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teraksin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was thirty cubits high and its thickness was only six handbreadths and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">stood? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since there was an extra handbreadt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of thickness, it was able to <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>even to such a great height.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Second Temple they did not fashion an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amah</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teraksin</span> to separate between the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary, as they had done in the First Temple? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>even though it is only six handbreadths thick, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>able to remain standing up to <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span>cubits in height. But <span class="gemarra-regular">it will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than that height. The Second Temple was taller than the First Temple, and therefore the partition separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary also had to be higher.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the Second Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">was taller </span>than the First Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former” </span>(Haggai 2:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagree about the meaning of this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar </span>who disagreed as to its meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that it means that the Second Temple will be greater <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the size of its <span class="gemarra-regular">structure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., taller. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span>

Daf 3b

that it will be greater <span class="gemarra-regular">in years, </span>meaning that the Second Temple will stand for a longer period of time than the First Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>true <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is </span>true, meaning that the Second Temple was taller than the First Temple and also stood for a longer period of time.
The Gemara asks: If so, if the Second Temple building was taller, then to separate between the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary in the Second Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">they should have made a wall thirty cubits </span>high <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">made a curtain </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest </span>of the height, the seventy-cubit difference in height between the First and Second Temples. The Gemara answers: This would have been impossible, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even when a thirty-cubit </span>wall that is six handbreadths thick <span class="gemarra-regular">stands, it is due to the ceiling and plaster </span>which attaches it to the ceiling that <span class="gemarra-regular">it stands. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">without a ceiling and plaster </span>holding it in place, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not stand.</span>
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But they should have made a wall </span>as high <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">possibly </span>stand by itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then should have <span class="gemarra-regular">made a curtain </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest </span>of the height. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>as a tradition that the partition separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary should be built <span class="gemarra-regular">either entirely as a wall or entirely as a curtain. </span>It should be built <span class="gemarra-regular">either entirely as a wall, </span>as is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the First <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple, or </span>it should be built <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely as a curtain, </span>as is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Tabernacle. </span>At no time, however, was there a partition that combined a wall and a curtain.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Do the measurements given in the mishna apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>the thickness of the materials themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the plaste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> with which the materials were coated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>just to <span class="gemarra-regular">them without their plaster? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable </span>to say the measurements refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">them and their plaster, as, if </span>it should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to say they refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">them without their plaster, </span>then the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have taught the measurements </span>of the plaster as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from here </span>that the measurements refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">them and their plaster? </span>The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that they apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">them without their plaster, and since </span>the plaster <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach </span>such a small measurement.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach with regard to bricks </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides one and a half handbreadths, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">provides one and a half handbreadths? </span>Evidently, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> lists even an amount less than one handbreadth. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>mention is made of half-handbreadths because <span class="gemarra-regular">they are fit to be combined </span>into a full handbreadth.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to the question, from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 13b) in which it is taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it on Shabbat, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">wide enough to receive </span>and hold <span class="gemarra-regular">a small brick. And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">small brick </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">half a large brick, </span>the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths. </span>That mishna is referring to a brick without the plaster.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the mishna in <span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">large bricks </span>that measure three full handbreadths, whereas here the mishna is referring to bricks that measure slightly less than three handbreadths, and the measurement of three handbreadths includes the plaster with which they are coated. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna there <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it teaches </span>about a brick <span class="gemarra-regular">of three handbreadths, </span>from which one can conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there exists </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a smaller-</span>sized brick. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from here </span>that the mishna there is referring to large bricks.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: A person may not demolis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a synagogu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until he </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">builds another synagogue </span>to take its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the reason for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> lest he fail to build a new structure after the old one has been razed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the reason for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the disruption of <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer, </span>for in the meantime there will be nowhere to pray.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these two explanations? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is another synagogue. </span>Even though the community has an alternative place to pray there is still a concern that the new synagogue will never get built. It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Mareimar and Mar Zutr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> demolished and built a summer synagogue in the winter, and, </span>in like manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">they built a winter synagogue in the summer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the community would never be left without a synagogue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>for the construction of a new synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been collected and it rests </span>before us for that purpose? Is it then permitted to demolish the old synagogue before building the new one? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Even if the money has been collected there is still concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>an opportunity for <span class="gemarra-regular">redeeming captive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will present itself, and they will hand over </span>the money for that urgent requirement, and the community will be left without a synagogue.
Ravina continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the bricks </span>to be used for the construction of the new synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">are piled up, the boards are prepared, and the beams are ready? </span>Is it permitted to demolish the old synagogue before building the new one? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span>an opportunity for <span class="gemarra-regular">redeeming captives will present itself, and they will sell </span>the building materials <span class="gemarra-regular">and hand over </span>the proceeds for this purpose. Ravina raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that is, if you are concerned that they will sell the materials to redeem captives, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">buil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the synagogue there should be a concern that they might come to sell the structure for that purpose, and therefore one should never be permitted to destroy an old synagogue. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: People do not sell their residences, </span>and certainly not their synagogues.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>that an old synagogue must not be razed before its replacement is built <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where cracks are not seen </span>in the old synagogue. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if cracks are see</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they may </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">demolish </span>the old synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">build </span>the new one. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is like </span>the incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">saw cracks in the synagogue </span>in his town <span class="gemarra-regular">of Mata Meḥasya </span>and immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">demolished it. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his bed in there, </span>to the building site, so that there should be no delays in the construction, as he himself required shelter from the rain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not remove </span>his bed from there <span class="gemarra-regular">until they </span>finished building the synagogue and even <span class="gemarra-regular">affixed drainpipes </span>to the structure.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How could Bava ben But</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have advised Hero</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to raze the Temple </span>and build another in its place, as will be described later? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person must not demolish a synagogue unless he </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">builds another synagogue </span>to take its place? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he saw cracks in </span>the old Temple structure. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>that actions taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">the government are different, as </span>the government <span class="gemarra-regular">does not go back </span>on its decisions. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned about negligence, as there is in the case of ordinary people. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Shmuel says: If the government says </span>it will <span class="gemarra-regular">uproot mountains, it will uproot mountains and not retract</span> its word.
§ The Gemara elaborates on the episode involving Bava ben Buta. <span class="gemarra-regular">Herod was a slave in the house of the Hasmoneans. He set his eyes upon a certain young girl </span>from the house of the Hasmoneans. <span class="gemarra-regular">One day that man, </span>Herod, <span class="gemarra-regular">heard a Divine Voic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that said: Any slave who rebels now will succeed. He rose up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">killed all his masters, but spared that girl. When that girl saw that he wanted to marry her, she went up to the roof and raised her voice, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Whoever comes and says: I come from the house of the Hasmoneans, is a slave, since only that girl, </span>i.e., I, <span class="gemarra-regular">remained from them. And that girl fell from the roof to the ground </span>and died.
It is related that Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">preserved </span>the girl’s body <span class="gemarra-regular">in honey for seven years </span>to prevent it from decaying. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he engaged in necrophilia with her </span>corpse and <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her </span>corpse. According to those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he engaged in necrophilia with her </span>corpse, the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he preserved her </span>body was <span class="gemarra-regular">to gratify his </span>carnal <span class="gemarra-regular">desires. And </span>according to those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her </span>corpse, the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he preserved her </span>body was <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">would say he married a king’s daughter.</span>
Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who expounds </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you” </span>(Deuteronomy 17:15) as meaning that he who is appointed as king must come from a Jewish family and cannot be an emancipated slave or a convert? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span>who expound the verse in this manner, insisting that a king must have Jewish roots. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">rose up and killed all the Sages, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">spared Bava ben Buta in order to take counsel with him. </span>

Daf 4a

Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a garland </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of porcupin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> hide <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>Bava ben Buta’s head, which <span class="gemarra-regular">pricked his eyes out. One day </span>Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">came and sat before him </span>without identifying himself in order to test him. <span class="gemarra-regular">He, </span>Herod, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: See, Master, what this evil slave </span>Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">is doing. </span>Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What should I do to him? </span>Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Master should curse him. </span>Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts” </span>(Ecclesiastes 10:20). Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: He is not a king, </span>since he rules illegally. Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">he were merely a rich man </span>I would not curse him, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And do not curse a rich person in your bedchamber” </span>(Ecclesiastes 10:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">were he only a leader </span>I would not curse him, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And you shall not curse a leader among your people” </span>(Exodus 22:27).
Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>That <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>“a leader among your people,” that is, to a fit Jew who <span class="gemarra-regular">acts as </span>a member of <span class="gemarra-regular">your people, </span>i.e., in accordance with Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this one does not do the deeds of your people. </span>Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">I am afraid of him. </span>Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There is nobody who will go and tell him, since you and I are sitting </span>here alone. Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “For a bird of the sky shall carry the sound, and that which has wings shall tell the matter” </span>(Ecclesiastes 10:20).
Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am he. Had I known that the Sages were so cautious I would not have killed them. Now, what is that man’s remedy, </span>i.e., what can I do to repent for my sinful actions? Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: He </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguished the light of the world </span>by killing the Torah Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, and the Torah is light” </span>(Proverbs 6:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">should go and occupy himself with the light of the world, </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And all the nations shall flow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">venaharu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] unto it” </span>(Isaiah 2:2), the word <span class="it-text">venaharu</span> alluding to light [<span class="it-text">nehora</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: He </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded the eye of the world, as it is written </span>in reference to the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if </span>it be committed through ignorance <span class="gemarra-regular">by the eyes of the congregation” </span>(Numbers 15:24), <span class="gemarra-regular">should go and occupy himself with the eye of the world, </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “I will desecrate my Temple, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes” </span>(Ezekiel 24:21).
Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am afraid of the </span>Roman <span class="gemarra-regular">government, </span>that they will not permit me to make changes in the Temple. Bava ben Buta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Send a messenger </span>who will <span class="gemarra-regular">travel </span>there for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year, and remain </span>there for another <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and </span>take yet another <span class="gemarra-regular">year </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">return. In the meantime, you can demolish </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and rebuild it. He did so. </span>Eventually, <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Herod from Rome: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">demolished it, do not demolish it; and if you have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">demolished it, do not rebuild it; and if you have demolished it and </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">rebuilt it, </span>you shall be counted among <span class="gemarra-regular">those who act wickedly, seeking counsel </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">after they have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">acted. </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you are armed </span>and in command of a military force, <span class="gemarra-regular">your book, </span>i.e., your genealogical record, <span class="gemarra-regular">is here. </span>You are <span class="gemarra-regular">neither a king [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">reikha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor the son of a king, </span>but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">Herod the slave who has made himself a freeman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelonya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-italic">reikha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It denotes <span class="gemarra-regular">royalty, as it is written: “I am today a tender [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and anointed king” </span>(II Samuel 3:39). <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that the meaning of the word is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from the term describing Joseph after he was appointed viceroy to the king: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they cried before him, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Avrekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 41:43).
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One who has not seen Herod’s building has never seen a beautiful building in his life. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what did he build it? Rabba said: With stones of white and green marble [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">umarmara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that he built it <span class="gemarra-regular">with stones of blue, white, and green marble. </span>Alternate rows of stones <span class="gemarra-regular">sent out an edge </span>a bit <span class="gemarra-regular">and drew in an edge </span>a bit, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they would </span>better <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>and hold <span class="gemarra-regular">the plaster. He considered covering it with gold, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis said to him: Leave it, </span>and do not cover it, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is more beautiful this </span>way, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it looks like the waves of the sea.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how did Bava ben Buta do this, </span>i.e., give advice to Herod the wicked? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi </span>who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">was Daniel punished</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Because he offered advic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Nebuchadnezzar, as </span>after sharing a harsh prophecy with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, redeem your sins with charity and your iniquities with graciousness to the poor, that there may be a lengthening of your prosperity” </span>(Daniel 4:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar” </span>(Daniel 4:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And at the end of twelve months” </span>(Daniel 4:26). Only after a year was the prophecy fulfilled but not before that, apparently because Nebuchadnezzar heeded Daniel’s advice.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave </span>like Herod <span class="gemarra-regular">is different since he is obligated in the mitzvot, </span>and therefore Bava ben Buta had to help him repent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say the Temple is different, as without </span>the help of <span class="gemarra-regular">the government it would not have been built.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that Daniel was punished? If we say </span>we know this <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written: “And Esther called for Hatach, </span>one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her” (Esther 4:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav said: Hatach is Daniel. This works out well according to the one who says </span>Daniel was called Hatach because <span class="gemarra-regular">they cut him down [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from his greatness </span>and turned him into a minor attendant. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>he was called Hatach <span class="gemarra-regular">because all governmental matters were determined [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] according to his word, what is there to say? </span>What punishment did he receive? The Gemara answers: His punishment was <span class="gemarra-regular">that they threw him into the den of lions.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: In a place where it is customary to build a wall of non-chiseled stone, or chiseled stone, or small bricks, or large bricks, they must build the partition with that material. <span class="gemarra-regular">Everything is in accordance with the regional custom. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the word <span class="gemarra-regular">everything </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to add? </span>The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add a place where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is customary </span>to build a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">out of palm and laurel branches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a place, the partition is built from those materials.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if the wall </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">falls, </span>the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the space </span>where the wall stood <span class="gemarra-regular">and the stones belong to both of them, </span>to be divided equally. The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the case, since both neighbors participated in the construction of the wall? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the entire wall <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into the domain of one of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Alternatively, </span>it is necessary in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of them </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">cleare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> all the stones <span class="gemarra-regular">into his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">domain. Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">should be </span>governed by the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>that is, if the other party should have to prove that he had been a partner in the construction of the wall, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that they are presumed to have been partners in the building of the wall, and neither requires further proof.
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly with regard to a garden, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary to build a partition </span>in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>his neighbor to join in building the partition. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>On the one hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">you said: And similarly with regard to a garden, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary to build a partition </span>in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>his neighbor to join in building the partition. One can infer <span class="gemarra-regular">that ordinarily, </span>where there is no custom, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him </span>to build a partition.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to an expanse of <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it is customary not to build a partition </span>between two people’s fields, and one person wishes to build a partition between his field and that of his neighbor, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>his neighbor to build such a partition. One can infer <span class="gemarra-regular">that ordinarily, </span>where there is no custom, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates him </span>to build a partition. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>by inference that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary garden </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>obligate him to build a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it necessary </span>to say that the court does not obligate him to build a partition in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary field? </span>Clearly in a field there is less of a need for a partition, as there is less damage caused by exposure to the gaze of others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: And similarly </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary garden, and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where it is customary to build a partition in </span>an expanse of <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates him </span>to build a partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: If so, what </span>is the point of the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">But, </span>mentioned afterward in connection with an expanse of fields, which seems to indicate that the issue of fields had not yet been addressed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: And similarly an ordinary garden is </span>treated <span class="gemarra-regular">like a place where it is customary to build a partition, and </span>therefore the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates him </span>to build a partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But an ordinary </span>expanse of <span class="gemarra-regular">fields is </span>treated <span class="gemarra-regular">like a place where it is customary not </span>to build a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him </span>to build one.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>one person <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes </span>to erect a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must withdraw into his own </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">and build </span>the partition there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he makes </span>a border <span class="gemarra-regular">mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the outer side </span>of the barrier facing his neighbor’s property, indicating that he built the entire structure of his own materials and on his own land. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of a border <span class="gemarra-regular">mark? Rav Huna said: He bends the edge </span>of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him make it on the inside. </span>The Gemara explains: In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might also make </span>a mark <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, </span>that is, on the side facing his own property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that is, there is a concern about such deception, <span class="gemarra-regular">now also </span>when the person who builds the wall makes a border mark on the outer side of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might cut it off and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara answers: Such <span class="gemarra-regular">a cut is noticeable </span>and the deception will not work.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that in answer to the question: What is the meaning of a border mark, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: He bends the edge </span>of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the inside. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him make it on the outside. </span>The Gemara explains: In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might cut it off and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that is, there is a concern for such deception, <span class="gemarra-regular">now also </span>when the person who builds the wall makes a border mark toward the inside, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might add </span>a border mark on his own side <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">An addition is noticeable </span>and the deception will not work. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that he makes the border mark <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside </span>and not on the inside? The Gemara comments: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>

Daf 4b

The party who builds the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">should smear i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with clay <span class="gemarra-regular">up to a cubi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> at the top of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him do </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside. </span>The Gemara explains: In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, </span>that is, on the side facing his own property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that is, if there is a concern for such deception, <span class="gemarra-regular">now also </span>when the person who builds the wall smears it with clay on the outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor can peel it off and say: </span>The wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Peeling </span>clay <span class="gemarra-regular">is noticeable </span>and the deception will not succeed.
The Gemara asks: If he builds a partition of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm branches, </span>how does he make a border mark? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: He directs the tips of the branche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him do </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to the inside. </span>The Gemara states: If he so directs the branches, <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor might also do </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">to the outside, </span>that is, to the side facing his own property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that is, if there is concern for such deception, <span class="gemarra-regular">now also </span>when the one who builds the partition directs the tips of the branches to the outside, the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can cut off </span>the tips <span class="gemarra-regular">and throw </span>them away, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">mine and his. </span>The Gemara counsels: <span class="gemarra-regular">He should smear </span>the tips of the palm branches <span class="gemarra-regular">with clay. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now also, the neighbor might come and peel </span>the clay off. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Peeling is noticeable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>One who builds a partition of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm branches has no remed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to prove who erected it, <span class="gemarra-regular">except with </span>a written <span class="gemarra-regular">document. </span>The neighbor should draw up a document stating that he has no claim to the space or to the partition, because they belong exclusively to the other neighbor.
§ The mishna teaches: Nevertheless, in a place where it is not customary to build a partition between two people’s fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they made </span>such a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">with the agreement of the two of them, </span>they build it in the middle, i.e., on the property line, and make a border mark on the one side and on the other side. Therefore, if the wall later falls, the assumption is that the space where the wall stood and the stones belong to both of them, to be divided equally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava from Parzika said to Rav Ashi: Neither this one nor that one should make </span>a border mark. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of them went ahead and made </span>a border mark <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">if his neighbor does not make </span>one as well, the first one <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">his.</span>
Rava from Parzika asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us a remedy </span>to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">against a swindler? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But isn’t the former clause </span>of the mishna’s ruling also <span class="gemarra-regular">a remedy </span>to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">against a swindler? </span>That clause teaches that one who builds a wall should make a border mark to indicate that the wall is his.
Rava from Parzika <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Granted, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the former clause </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> that if one wishes to build a partition between his own field and that of his neighbor, he does so at his own expense and on his own land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and due to </span>the need to teach that <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught a remedy </span>to be used against a swindler. <span class="gemarra-regular">But does he teach a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches a remedy </span>to be used against a swindler? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Here, </span>in the latter clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a barrier made of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm branches. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abaye, who said: </span>One who builds a partition of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm branches has no remedy </span>to prove who erected it, <span class="gemarra-regular">except with </span>a written <span class="gemarra-regular">document. He teaches us that </span>a border <span class="gemarra-regular">mark suffices.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who surrounds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on three sides, </span>that is, he owns parcels of land on three sides of the other person’s field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, the second, and the third </span>sides, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the neighbor who owns the inner field to contribute to the construction of the partition if he does not wish to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If he arose and built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>side of the field, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon </span>the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he arose and built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>side of the field, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon </span>the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions. The Gemara comments: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>if it was the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field who <span class="gemarra-regular">arose </span>and built a partition on the fourth side, and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>if it was the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field who <span class="gemarra-regular">arose </span>and built a partition on the fourth side. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same in both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to the following point. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that when Rabbi Yosei said the court obligates the owner of the inner field to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions, he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with what </span>the other person actually spent when he <span class="gemarra-regular">built the partitions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, the owner of the inner field must contribute his share according to the cost of the partition his neighbor built. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav says: </span>He must pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and no more. The owner of the surrounded field can claim he had no desire for a more substantial partition.
The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from what <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who surrounds another on three sides, </span>that is, he owns parcels of land on three sides of the other person’s field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, the second, and the third </span>sides, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>the neighbor who owns the inner field to contribute to the construction of the partition. By inference, if he also built a partition on the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>side of the field, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does obligate </span>the owner of the inner field to contribute to the building of the partition. The Gemara continues with its proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If he arose and built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>side of the field, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon </span>the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions. The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Yosei seem to be stating the same ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rav Huna, who says </span>that the owner of the inner field pays for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with what </span>the other person actually spent when he <span class="gemarra-regular">built the partitions, this is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yosei: The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he pays his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds, but not </span>a larger sum in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>the other person actually spent when he <span class="gemarra-regular">built the partitions. And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that he pays his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with what </span>the other person actually spent when he <span class="gemarra-regular">built the partitions.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Ḥiyya bar Rav, who says </span>he pays his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the value of </span>a partition fashioned from <span class="gemarra-regular">inexpensive reeds, what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is there between the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yosei? If </span>according to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not give him </span>his share for all of the partitions in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds, what does he give him?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say there is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the wage of a watchman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>since his field is safeguarded by the partition which surrounds it, the one who built the partition can demand payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wage of a watchman. </span>He cannot, however, demand the cost of building the partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>even the other’s share for all of the partitions in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds. And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that he can demand the other’s share for all of the partitions in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say there is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the partitions built on the <span class="gemarra-regular">first, second, and third </span>sides of the inner field. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that the owner of the inner field must <span class="gemarra-regular">give to </span>his neighbor money for the partition built on the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>side, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>money for the partitions built on the <span class="gemarra-regular">first, second, and third </span>sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">also give him </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the partitions built on <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, the second, and the third </span>sides.
The Gemara suggests another difference between the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say there is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the issue of whether the partition on the fourth side was built by the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>by the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field must contribute his share of the entire expense is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he arose </span>and built a partition on the fourth side of his field. Therefore, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon him </span>the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions, because his actions demonstrate that he wants the partition between their fields. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">arose </span>and built a partition on the fourth side of the field, the owner of the surrounded field <span class="gemarra-regular">must give him only </span>his share of <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of </span>the partition of the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different </span>if it was the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field who arose and built a partition on the fourth side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different </span>if it was the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field who arose and built a partition on the fourth side. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>either one <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and built a partition </span>on the fourth side, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon </span>the owner of the inner field the obligation to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the partitions.
The Gemara reports <span class="gemarra-regular">another version </span>of this last answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the issue of whether the partition on the fourth side was built by the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>by the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>side, the owner of the surrounded field <span class="gemarra-regular">also gives him </span>his share of the cost of the partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">arose </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">built a partition </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">does he give </span>the owner of the surrounding field his share of the cost of the partitions. Why is that? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he reveals that he is pleased </span>with the partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">built a partition</span> on the fourth side, the owner of the surrounded field <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give him anything, </span>as he can continue to claim that he has no interest in the partitions. 

Daf 5a

It is related that a man named <span class="gemarra-regular">Ronya </span>had a field that <span class="gemarra-regular">was surrounded by </span>fields belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina on </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">four sides. </span>Ravina built partitions around his fields and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Give me </span>your share of the expense <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with what I </span>actually spent when I <span class="gemarra-regular">built the partitions, </span>i.e., half the cost of the partitions. Ronya <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span>Ravina said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>then at least your share of the expense <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of reeds. </span>Ronya <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span>Ravina said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>then at least <span class="gemarra-regular">the wage of a watchman. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not give</span> even this <span class="gemarra-regular">to him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One day, </span>Ronya <span class="gemarra-regular">was harvesting dates. </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to his sharecropper: Go take a cluster [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kibbura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dates from him. </span>The sharecropper <span class="gemarra-regular">went to bring them, </span>but Ronya <span class="gemarra-regular">raised his voice at him </span>in protest, whereupon Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have revealed that you are pleased </span>with the partitions and the protection that they provide you. Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if it were only a goat </span>that entered your field, <span class="gemarra-regular">wouldn’t </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">need safeguarding, </span>to prevent the goat from eating the dates? Ronya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If it were <span class="gemarra-regular">only a goat, doesn’t </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">to chase it away [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’akhluyei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> No partition is required. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But wouldn’t you need a man to chase </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">away? </span>Pay me then at least the wage of a watchman.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava </span>to adjudicate the matter. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Ronya: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go appease </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">with what he </span>expressed his willingness to be <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased with, </span>namely, the wage of a watchman. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, I will judge you in accordance with </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>and you will be required to pay half the cost of the partition based on what Ravina actually spent on it.
Incidental to that episode, the Gemara relates another encounter between Ravina and Ronya. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ronya </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">bought land adjoining </span>property belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina. Ravina considered removing him due to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of one </span>whose field <span class="gemarra-regular">borders </span>the field of his neighbor. When land is up for sale, the owners of the adjoining fields have the right of first refusal. If one of the neighbors is willing to match the highest price being offered to the seller, that neighbor has the preemptive right to purchase the property, and if somebody else buys it, that buyer can be removed. Since Ravina owned the adjacent property, he thought that he enjoyed the right of first refusal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra, son of Rav Yeiva, said to Ravina: People say: Four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">for a large hide [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four for a small hide [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzelala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Since Ronya also owned land bordering the desired parcel, you cannot remove him even though his plot of land is smaller than yours.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a dividing <span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>in a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if one of the owners wishes to rebuild the wall, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>the other owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to build </span>the wall with him <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed to have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">give</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> his share of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">brings proof that </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>his part.
The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">higher than four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But if the reluctant neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">built another wall close </span>to the wall that had been built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon him </span>the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the rebuilt wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though he has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">set a roof over it. </span>Since he has demonstrated his desire to make use of what his neighbor built, he must participate in the cost of its construction. If the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">is presumed not to have given </span>his share of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he brings proof that he did </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>money for the building of the wall.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>If a lender <span class="gemarra-regular">set a time for another </span>to repay the loan that he had extended to him <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when the debt came due the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the lender: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid you within the time, he is not deemed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as people do not ordinarily repay their debts before they are due. The lender would be happy <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">would only repay </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">on time. Abaye and Rava </span>disagree with Reish Lakish, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they both say: A person is apt to repay </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">within its time, </span>i.e., before it is due. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes he happens to have money </span>and the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">repay </span>my debt

Daf 5b

<span class="gemarra-regular">so that he will not trouble me </span>later by constantly demanding the money.
The Gemara attempts to bring a proof in support of the opinion of Abaye and Rava from what <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna (5a): If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed to have given </span>his share of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">brings proof that </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>his part.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case under discussion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: I paid you at the time </span>when the payment became due, when the wall was completed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is presumed to have given </span>his part. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not that he said to him: I paid you within the time </span>before the payment became due, while the wall was still under construction? And with regard to such a case the mishna states that he is presumed to have given his share. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person is apt to repay </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">within its time, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Abaye and Rava. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, because the time </span>to pay is upon the completion of <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every row</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Payment does not become due specifically at the completion of the entire wall.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof in support of the opinion of Reish Lakish from the continuation of the mishna (5a): The court does not obligate the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the wall higher than four cubits. But if the reluctant neighbor built another wall close to the wall that had been built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court imposes upon him the responsibility to pay his share for all of the rebuilt wall, even though he has not yet set a roof over it. If the builder of the first wall later claims he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">is presumed not to have given </span>his share of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he brings proof that he did </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>money for the building of the wall.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case under discussion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: I paid you at the time </span>that the payment became due, when the wall was completed, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>deemed credible? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not that he said to him: I paid you within the time </span>before the payment became due, and therefore he is not deemed credible? <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, a person is not apt to repay </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">within its time, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, since </span>the reluctant neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Who says that the Rabbis will obligate me </span>to pay for this wall? In such a case he certainly does not pay before the payment becomes due.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, acted </span>in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava. Mar bar Rav Ashi acted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish. </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that one is not deemed credible when he says that he repaid a loan before it became due. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the debtor dies, the court collects payment <span class="gemarra-regular">even from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> based on this assumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though the Master said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who comes to collect </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from the property of orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot collect unless </span>he first takes <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>that he did not already collect the debt from the deceased, here he can collect without taking an oath because there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a presumptio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is not apt to repay </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">within its time.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if the lender stipulated a time with the borrower for repayment of the debt, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he demanded </span>payment of the money <span class="gemarra-regular">after the tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that the payment became due had passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid you within the time </span>before the payment became due? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a presumption </span>against someone’s claim, as in this case where there is a presumption that people do not pay their debts before they become due, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the borrower can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why would I lie? </span>If one of the litigants could have advanced a claim more advantageous to his cause than the one he actually did, the assumption is that he is telling the truth. Consequently, in this case had the borrower wished to lie, he could have said that he repaid his debt when it became due, and he would have been deemed credible. Therefore, when he claims that he repaid it before it came due he should also be deemed credible. 

Daf 6a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps where there is a presumption </span>against a person’s claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the borrower can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why would I lie? </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed to have given </span>his share of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">brings proof that </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>his share.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>one partner <span class="gemarra-regular">demanded </span>that the other party pay the money <span class="gemarra-regular">after the time </span>that the payment became due, i.e., after the wall was rebuilt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other partner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I paid you at the time </span>that the payment became due, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he is presumed to have given him the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: I paid you within the time, </span>i.e., before the payment became due? <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, even where there is a presumption </span>against a person’s claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the defendant can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why would I lie? </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, because the time </span>to pay is upon the completion of <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every row. </span>Therefore, it is as if he said: I paid you at the time that the payment became due.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof from the continuation of the mishna. The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate</span> the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the part of the wall that is <span class="gemarra-regular">above four cubits. </span>But if the reluctant neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">built another wall close to </span>the wall that was built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court imposes upon him the responsibility to pay his share for all of the rebuilt wall, even though he has not yet set a roof over it.

In such a case he certainly does not pay before the payment becomes due. The mishna does not provide a proof one way or the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what is taught in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 38b): If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the other one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in the presence of witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>that is so; and <span class="gemarra-regular">the next day </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>the money that you owe me, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to you, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>But if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nothing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that when he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to you, he is saying to him: I repaid you at the time </span>that the payment became due; and when he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nothing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, he is saying to him: I repaid you within the time, </span>before the payment became due? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>with regard to the latter case that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. Apparently, where there is a presumption </span>against a person’s claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that the borrower can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why would I lie? </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, what </span>does he mean when he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nothing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession? </span>He is saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were never such matters; </span>i.e., the purported loan never occurred. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Master says: Anyone who says: I did not borrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>treated <span class="gemarra-regular">as one who says: I did not repay, </span>and since it is known by his own admission that he borrowed money, he is liable to pay.
§ The mishna teaches: But if the reluctant neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">built another wall close to </span>the wall that was built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon him </span>the responsibility to pay his share for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the rebuilt wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he built </span>another wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close to </span>the first wall that was <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the length or the height of the wall that was built higher than four cubits, it is as if <span class="gemarra-regular">he built </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">close to </span>the height and length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>wall. Since he can easily add to his wall so that it will be equal in length or height to the wall the neighbor rebuilt, he must therefore pay half the cost of the entire rebuilt wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he built close, he built </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">close</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he did not build close, he did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">build </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">close. </span>Accordingly, he is required to pay an additional share only for the part of the wall corresponding to the new wall he built.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna concedes with regard to an attachment to the corne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of his house that he is not required to pay half the cost of the entire rebuilt wall. If he built the extension of his house in this manner, it is not considered as if he built it close to the entire wall, as it is unlikely that he will add to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case in which he places a heavy <span class="gemarra-regular">beam [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’afriza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> on the wall that can support a roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>carves into the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">indentations to fix beams in place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then even if he has not yet made use of the entire height of the wall, he has demonstrated his desire to do so in the future, and therefore he must pay half the cost of the entire wall.
§ The mishna teaches that if the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor is presumed not to have given his share of the money, unless he brings proof that he did in fact give money for the building of the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>Even if <span class="gemarra-regular">openings in the wall </span>were built on the side facing the reluctant partner and these openings are suited to serve as beam rests, this does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>create <span class="gemarra-regular">a presumption </span>that the reluctant partner contributed his share to the building of the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the builder of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">made sill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for these openings. As the builder of the wall can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>his neighbor: <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>to myself that <span class="gemarra-regular">when you will appease me </span>and pay me for the construction of the wall, you might want to attach beams to it, and I do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>want <span class="gemarra-regular">the foundations of my wall to be damaged </span>by your fashioning new openings in it. Therefore, from the outset, I built the wall with these openings.
With regard to the use of a neighbor’s wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thin beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on his neighbor’s wall, i.e., if one had used the wall in that manner in the past and the owner did not protest, so the one using it can maintain that he had acquired from the owner the right to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thick beams </span>there. But if he acquired the privilege <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thick beams </span>on the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thin beams </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thin beams, he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thick beams.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thin beams </span>on his neighbor’s wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thick beams </span>there; and if he acquired the privilege <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thick beams, he has acquired the privilege to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">thin beams. </span>This version of Rav Naḥman’s statement accords with the statement of Rav Yosef.
With regard to a similar matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water dri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> from his roof into his neighbor’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the privilege to </span>let the <span class="gemarra-regular">water pour </span>there though a drainpipe. If the neighbor did not protest about the water dripping from the roof into his courtyard, he would certainly allow him to build a drainpipe, which would limit the water to a single place. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired the privilege to </span>let the <span class="gemarra-regular">water pour </span>through a drainpipe into his neighbor’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired the privilege </span>to let <span class="gemarra-regular">water drip </span>there from his roof. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef says: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water pour </span>there through a drainpipe, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water drip </span>there from his roof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water pou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> through a drainpipe into his neighbor’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water drip </span>there from his roof; and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water drip </span>from his roof into his neighbor’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the privilege to </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">water pour </span>there through a drainpipe. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquired the privilege <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>let water drip from <span class="gemarra-regular">a hut </span>whose roof is composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of willow branche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> into his neighbor’s courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>He has acquired the privilege to let water drip there <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a hut </span>whose roof is composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of willow branches. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef performed an action, </span>i.e., issued a practical ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a hut </span>whose roof is composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of willow branches, </span>allowing the neighbor to let water drip from there after he had acquired the privilege to use a drainpipe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one rents a room to another</span>

Daf 6b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in a large building </span>with many residences, the renter <span class="gemarra-regular">may make use of the </span>building’s <span class="gemarra-regular">projection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and of the </span>cavities in its external <span class="gemarra-regular">walls up to </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from his room, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he may make use <span class="gemarra-regular">of the thickness of the wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place where it is customar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for making use <span class="gemarra-regular">of the building’s </span>front <span class="gemarra-regular">garden [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">betarbatz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman himself said: </span>He may make use <span class="gemarra-regular">of even the building’s </span>front <span class="gemarra-regular">garden. But </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">the yard that is at the back of the house. And Rava said: </span>He may use <span class="gemarra-regular">even the yard that is at the back of the house.</span>
Apropos the use of a wall between neighbors, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: </span>If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>supporting a covering <span class="gemarra-regular">for shad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> was resting on his neighbor’s wall <span class="gemarra-regular">for up to thirt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days, there is no acquired privilege </span>for him to continue using it, since the neighbor can claim that he had assumed that the beam was there only temporarily and for that reason he did not protest. But <span class="gemarra-regular">after thirty days, there is an acquired privilege. And if it was </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that was being used <span class="gemarra-regular">for the mitzv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> on the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for up to seven days there is no acquired privilege </span>for him to continue using it, since it is assumed that it is there for the mitzva and that after the Festival it will be removed. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">after seven days </span>the neighbor did not protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an acquired privilege </span>for him to continue using it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the one using the beam <span class="gemarra-regular">attached it with clay, there is immediately </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on two sides of a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>one, the owner of one of the houses, must <span class="gemarra-regular">build a fence for half his roof, and that </span>one, the owner of the other house, must <span class="gemarra-regular">build a fence for half his roof. </span>They must position the fences so that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>fence <span class="gemarra-regular">is not opposite the other </span>fence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>each one must <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>to his fence a little beyond the midway point, so that each one should not be able to see the activity on the other’s roof.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>the case of two houses on opposite sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, </span>considering that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the two houses are separated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary for </span>Abaye to mention <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, lest you say </span>that one neighbor can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, you need to conceal </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">from people in the public domain. </span>Since in any event you have to build a fence across your entire roof, you cannot compel me to build a fence on my roof.
To counter this, Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not so, because the second homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the first in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The public can see me </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day, </span>when pedestrians pass by, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they cannot see me at night. You, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">can see me both during the day and at night. Alternatively, </span>he can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">The public can see me </span>from the street only <span class="gemarra-regular">when I am standing, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">they cannot see me when I am sitting. You, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">can see me both when I am standing and when I am sitting. </span>And furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the public can see me </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when they look </span>specifically at me, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they cannot see me when they do not look </span>specifically at me, since the average pedestrian does not look up to see what is happening on the roofs. <span class="gemarra-regular">You, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">can see me in any case, </span>because you live opposite me.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master, </span>i.e., Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the owner of one of the houses, must <span class="gemarra-regular">build a fence for half his roof, and that </span>one, the owner of the other house, must <span class="gemarra-regular">build a fence for half his roof. </span>They must position the fences so that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>fence <span class="gemarra-regular">is not opposite the other </span>fence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>each one must <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>to his fence a little beyond the midway point. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that each one must make a fence for half his roof?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them went ahead </span>on his own and <span class="gemarra-regular">constructe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> a fence on half his roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the other can say to him: Take </span>from me compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the expenditure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uzinka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and you build the entire </span>fence, and in that way we will not invade one another’s privacy. Therefore, Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the neighbor who built the fence for half his roof <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: What is the reason you do not </span>want to <span class="gemarra-regular">build </span>a fence? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the added weight <span class="gemarra-regular">will damage your house’s foundation. My foundation too will be damaged </span>if I continue to build on my roof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">roof is adjacent to his neighbor’s courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he must build a fence </span>on the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits high, </span>so that he will not be able to see into his neighbor’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to build a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">roof and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">roof. And Rav Naḥman him-self says: He is not required to </span>build a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>high on the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he is required to </span>build <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>purpose, according to Rav Naḥman, does the neighbor have to build such a partition? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>prevent <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by exposure to the <span class="gemarra-regular">sight </span>of others, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>a partition of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to catch </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">as a thief, </span>i.e., to set a boundary between the two properties so that any trespass will be construed as attempted theft, <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere partition of pegs suffices. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is to prevent <span class="gemarra-regular">kid goats and lambs </span>from crossing from one roof to the other, a low partition that is high <span class="gemarra-regular">enough so that </span>the goat or lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">leap headlong </span>from one roof to the other <span class="gemarra-regular">suffices. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is built <span class="gemarra-regular">to catch </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">as a thief. With a partition of pegs he can give an excus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">stretching himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">with a partition of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot give </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an excuse.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If his courtyard was higher than the other’s roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is not required to attend to it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What, is it not </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is not required to attend to it at all, </span>i.e., that he need not build any type of fence? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not required to attend </span>to building a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">of four cubits, but he must attend to </span>building <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition of ten </span>handbreadths, as maintained by Rav Naḥman.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree about the following case: If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one higher than the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna says </span>that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">builds </span>the wall separating the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">from his level and upward, and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">builds </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from his level and upward. And Rav Ḥisda says: </span>The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">assists </span>the owner of the lower courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and buil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">ds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from below, </span>even including that part of the wall which is opposite the lower courtyard.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards, one higher than the other, </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot say: I will build from my level and upward, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he assists </span>the owner of the lower courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and builds from below. And if his courtyard is higher than the roof of his neighbor, he is not required to attend to it. </span>The owner of the upper courtyard need not build a partition because people do not ordinarily use their roofs.
§ It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were living </span>in a two-story building; <span class="gemarra-regular">one was living in the upper </span>story, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one was living in the lower </span>one. <span class="gemarra-regular">The lower </span>story began to <span class="gemarra-regular">collapse, </span>its walls sinking into the ground to the point that it was no longer fit for dwelling. The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>story <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come and let us </span>demolish the whole building and <span class="gemarra-regular">rebuild it </span>together. The owner of the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am living comfortably </span>and am under no obligation to rebuild your residence. 

Daf 7a

The owner of the lower story <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will dismantle </span>the structure <span class="gemarra-regular">and rebuild it. </span>The owner of the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>But then <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">have no place to live </span>while you are renovating. The owner of the lower story <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will rent a place for you </span>to live for the duration. The owner of the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I do not </span>want <span class="gemarra-regular">to bother </span>with moving. The owner of the lower story said to him: But <span class="gemarra-regular">I cannot live </span>in my apartment in this condition, as the walls have sunk into the ground. The owner of the upper story said to him: That is not my problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">Crawl on your stomach to go in, and crawl on your stomach to go out.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama said: By law, </span>the owner of the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">can preven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his downstairs neighbor from rebuilding. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only when the beams </span>supporting the second story <span class="gemarra-regular">have not reached lower than ten </span>handbreadths from the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">beams have reached lower than ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, the owner of the lower story <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the upper story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Below ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">is my domain and </span>my domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is not bound to you </span>to support your residence.
The Gemara further comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement, </span>that the owner of the upper story can prevent his downstairs neighbor from rebuilding, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not stipulate with each other </span>that if the house sinks they will rebuild the house anew. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if they made </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation with each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they must dismantle </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">and rebuild it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they made </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation with each other, to what exten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> must the ceiling of the lower story drop before they implement the stipulation? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said before Rabba in the name of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, who said in the name of Rav Naḥman: Like that which we learned </span>in a mishna (98b): If one takes upon himself to build a house for another person, without stipulating its dimensions, <span class="gemarra-regular">its height </span>must be equal to the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">half its length and half its width. Rabba said to them: Did I not tell you not to hang empty pitchers on Rav Naḥman, </span>meaning not to attribute foolish opinions to him? Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what Rav Naḥman said: As people normally live, </span>and no more. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>space is that? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>The ceiling of the lower story must be high enough <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one could bring in bundles </span>of reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the type made in <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span> be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">turn around.</span>
It is further related that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man built a wall outside the windows of his neighbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You are </span>blocking the light with your wall and <span class="gemarra-regular">darkening my </span>house. The one who built the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will seal </span>your windows <span class="gemarra-regular">here and make </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">windows for you </span>in your wall <span class="gemarra-regular">above the wall </span>that I am building. The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>By doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">you will damage my wall. </span>The one who built the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will demolish your wall until the level of the windows and rebuild it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will make windows for you in </span>the new part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the building above my wall. </span>The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A wall that is old at the bottom and new at the top will not endure.</span>
The one who built the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will demolish </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">until the ground and </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">rebuild it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will make windows for you in it </span>above my wall. The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One new wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in an old house will not endure. </span>The one who built the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will demolish your entire house and put windows in the </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">building </span>that I will erect in its place. The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>But in the meantime <span class="gemarra-regular">I will have no place to live. </span>The one who built the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will rent a place for you </span>to live. The neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I do not </span>want <span class="gemarra-regular">to bother </span>with moving. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama said: By law, </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can prevent </span>him from building the wall.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> case; this case is very similar to the previous case of the owner of the upper story who can prevent the owner of the lower story from rebuilding. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this additional </span>case? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that even if he uses </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">only for </span>storing <span class="gemarra-regular">straw and wood, </span>he can still maintain that blocking the light causes him damage and can prevent the neighbor from erecting the wall.
The Gemara further relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were two brothers who divided </span>their father’s estate <span class="gemarra-regular">between them. One received a hall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aspelida</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in his share <span class="gemarra-regular">and one received a garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The one who received the garden went and built a wall in front of the opening of the hall. </span>His brother <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You are </span>blocking the light with your wall and <span class="gemarra-regular">darkening my </span>house. The one who received the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am building on my </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama said: By right he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>as it is permitted for him to build there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">different from that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers divided </span>their father’s estate between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them taking a vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one taking a grain field, the owner of the vineyard has </span>the right to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grain fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for the purpose of working the vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it was on that condition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they divided </span>the estate. Why in this case does the owner of the hall not have the right to make use of the light coming in from the garden?
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>the reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they made an assessment with each other </span>with regard to the value of the fields, arranging for compensation if one received more than the other, and they took the work area into account. Ravina asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But what </span>did they do <span class="gemarra-regular">here? Did they not make an assessment with each other? Are we dealing with fools, that this one took the </span>valuable <span class="gemarra-regular">hall and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one took </span>the much less valuable <span class="gemarra-regular">garden without making an assessment with each other? Rav Ashi said to him: Although they assessed with each other the value of the bricks, the beams, and the boards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they did not assess with each other the value of the airspace. </span>With regard to that, each one retained full rights to his respective airspace.
The Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the one who received the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, you gave me </span>a well-lit <span class="gemarra-regular">hall; now you are making it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span>dark <span class="gemarra-regular">room [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">idrona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: He gave him only </span>a place that is called a hall <span class="gemarra-regular">by name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that is, a place that is called a hall even though it is no longer used that way.
Rav Ashi continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of dirt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it becomes his even if it is only a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">letekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a half-<span class="it-text">kor</span>, and the sale is not void, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he sold him only </span>a place that is called a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by name. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>ruling applies only as long as the land he is selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">calle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Similarly, if he says to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you an orchard, it becomes his even if it lacks pomegranates, because he sold him only </span>a place that is called an orchard <span class="gemarra-regular">by name. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>applies only as long as the land he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">called an orchard. </span>And similarly, if he says to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a vineyard, it becomes his even if it lacks grapevines, because he sold him only </span>a place that is called a vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">by name. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this</span> applies only as long as the land he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">called a vineyard.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, the seller can say to the buyer: I sold you </span>only a place that is called that <span class="gemarra-regular">by name; here, </span>the one who received the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>his brother: <span class="gemarra-regular">I took </span>this portion <span class="gemarra-regular">as my share on condition that I would live there the way our fathers lived </span>there, and that you would not change that by blocking the light entering through the windows.
With regard to Rav Ḥama’s ruling that it is permitted for the brother who received the garden to build a wall in front of the hall, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him, </span>

Daf 7b

i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Yenuka and Mar Kashisha, sons of Rav Ḥisda, </span>said to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi: The </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a </span>follow <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>usual line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as Rav Ḥama, who was from Neharde’a, issued his ruling in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, who was also from that city. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> their father’s estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have </span>a right-of-<span class="gemarra-regular">way against each other. </span>Although the father would traverse the outer field from the inner field to access the public domain, the brother who received the inner field as an inheritance does not have the right to traverse his brother’s outer field.
Shmuel continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against each other, </span>i.e., the right to prevent the other from building a wall facing his windows; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against each other, </span>i.e., the right to set up a ladder in the other’s property in order to get to his own; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against each other, </span>i.e., the right to pass a water channel through the other’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And be careful with these, since they are established </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rava says: </span>The brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">do have </span>all of the aforementioned rights. Rav Ḥama agrees with Shmuel’s opinion, that each brother can do as he pleases on his own property without the other one preventing him from doing so.
Since Rav Ḥama’s rulings were mentioned, the Gemara cites another halakhic ruling in his name. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain promissory note </span>inherited <span class="gemarra-regular">by orphans </span>from their father, stating that somebody owed them money, <span class="gemarra-regular">against which a receipt was produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by the borrower, stating that the debt was already paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama said: We cannot </span>use the note to <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt on behalf of the orphans, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor can we tear it up. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">We cannot collect </span>with the note because <span class="gemarra-regular">a receipt against it was produced </span>by the borrower; and <span class="gemarra-regular">we cannot tear </span>the note <span class="gemarra-regular">up because perhaps when the orphans grow up they will bring proof </span>that the receipt was forged <span class="gemarra-regular">and undermine it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Ravina: What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: In all </span>the cases in this discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama, except for </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the receipt, because we do not presume that the witnesses are liars. </span>Since witnesses signed the receipt, the court trusts that the debt was paid and they tear up the promissory note.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said: In this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama, </span>because the validity of the receipt is in doubt. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if it is so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a valid receipt, </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">should have produced it during their father’s lifetime. And since he did not produce it </span>at the proper time, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn from this that he </span>may have <span class="gemarra-regular">forged it. </span>Even though this is not an absolute proof, it is sufficient reason not to tear up the promissory note.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The residents of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>financially participate in the <span class="gemarra-regular">building of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gatehous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and a door to the </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Not all courtyards require a gatehouse, </span>and each courtyard must be considered on its own in accordance with its specific needs. Similarly, the residents of a city <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that city <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-regular">building of a wall, double doors, and a crossbar for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Not all towns require a wall.</span>
With regard to this latter obligation, the mishna asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How long </span>must one live <span class="gemarra-regular">in the cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city </span>and therefore obligated to contribute to these expenses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Twelve months. </span>But if he <span class="gemarra-regular">bought </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence in </span>the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is immediately </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>making <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse is beneficial? But </span>wasn’t there <span class="gemarra-regular">that pious man, with whom </span>the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">Elija</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was accustomed to speak, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">built a gatehouse, and </span>after-ward Elijah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not speak with him again? </span>The objection to the building of a gatehouse is that the guard who mans it prevents the poor from entering and asking for charity. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This,</span> the case presented in the mishna, is referring to a gatehouse built <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">insid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the courtyard, in which case the poor can at least reach the courtyard’s entrance and be heard inside the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>the story of the pious man and Elijah, involves a gatehouse that was built <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside </span>of the courtyard, completely blocking the poor’s access to the courtyard’s entrance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>cases the gatehouse was built <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>In the one case, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a door </span>to the gatehouse, so that the poor cannot be heard inside the courtyard, while in the other case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no door. Or if you wish, say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a door, and </span>still this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>In the one case, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a ke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> needed to open the door, and the key is not available to the poor people, whereas in the other case, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no key </span>needed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or if you wish, say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a key </span>needed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>even so this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>In the one case <span class="gemarra-regular">the key is on the inside, </span>so that the poor cannot reach it, while in the other case of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">the key is on the outside.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that the residents of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>financially participate in the <span class="gemarra-regular">building of a gatehouse and a door to the </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all courtyards require a gatehouse. Rather, a courtyard that adjoins the public domain requires a gatehouse </span>to prevent people from peering in. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not adjoin the public domain does not require a gatehouse. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>make this distinction? The Gemara answers: Even if a courtyard does not adjoin the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">people in the public domain sometimes are forced </span>toward the courtyard due to crowding in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and come and enter </span>the courtyard.
§ The mishna teaches that the residents of a city <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that city <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-regular">building </span>of a wall, double doors, and a crossbar <span class="gemarra-regular">for the city. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The residents of a city <span class="gemarra-regular">can compel </span>each inhabitant of that city <span class="gemarra-regular">to build double doors and a crossbar for the city. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all cities require a wall. Rather, a city that adjoins the </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">border requires a wall, whereas </span>a city <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not adjoin the </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">border does not require a wall. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>make this distinction? The Gemara answers: Even if a city does not adjoin the border, <span class="gemarra-regular">it sometimes happens that </span>invading <span class="gemarra-regular">troops come </span>into the area. Therefore, it is always good for a city to be protected by a wall.
With regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elaza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When </span>the residents of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>money to build a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">do they collect based on </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> living in each house, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps they collect based on the </span>net <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>of each person? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: They collect based on the </span>net <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>of each person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Elazar, my son, </span>you shall <span class="gemarra-regular">fix nails in this, </span>i.e., this is an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and you must not veer from it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: When they collect </span>money to build a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">do they collect based on the proximity of the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to the wall, so that those people who live closer to the wall pay more? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps they collect based on the </span>net <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>of each person. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: They collect based on the proximity of the houses </span>to the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Elazar, my son, </span>you shall <span class="gemarra-regular">fix nails in this.</span>
§ It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda Nesi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">imposed </span>payment of the tax for <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Sages. Reish Lakish said to him: The Sages do not require protection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: </span>“How precious are your dear ones to me, O God…<span class="gemarra-regular">If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand” </span>(Psalms 139:17–18). <span class="gemarra-regular">If I should count whom? If we say </span>this is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous, </span>and the verse is saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are greater in number than the </span>grains of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand, </span>this is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written about all of Israel: “As the sand which is upon the seashore” </span>(Genesis 22:17), can <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous themselves, </span>who are a part of Israel, <span class="gemarra-regular">be greater in number than the </span>grains of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand? </span>How can they possibly outnumber the grains of sand upon the seashore?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>is what the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">I should count the deeds of the righteous, they are greater in number than the </span>grains of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand. And </span>it follows by <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the </span>grains of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand, which are fewer </span>in number, <span class="gemarra-regular">protect </span>the shore from <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea, </span>barring it from flowing inland (see Jeremiah 5:22), <span class="gemarra-regular">do not all the more so the deeds of the righteous, which are greater </span>in number, <span class="gemarra-regular">protect them? </span>Consequently the Sages do not need additional protection.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>and reported the exchange to him, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you did not quote this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: “I am a wall and my breasts are like towers” </span>(Song of Songs 8:10), which may be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I am a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah. “And my breasts are like towers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span> 

Daf 8a

<span class="gemarra-regular">these are Torah scholars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and towers do not require additional protection? The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish, </span>who did not cite this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>in accordance with the way that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava expounded </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I am a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Congregation of Israel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And my breasts are like towers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are the synagogues and study halls.</span>
It is similarly related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">im-posed </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>poll <span class="gemarra-regular">tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Sages. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to him: You have transgressed </span>the words of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings.</span>
You have transgressed the words of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, as it is written: “Even when He loves the peoples, all His holy ones are in Your hand” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:3), which is understood to mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses said to the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when You hold the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">nations dear </span>and grant them dominion over Israel, let <span class="gemarra-regular">“all His holy ones,” </span>meaning the Torah scholars, <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">in Your hand </span>and free from the authority of the nations, and therefore be exempt from pay-ing taxes. The continuation of that verse can also be understood as referring to Torah scholars, as it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they sit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tukku</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] at Your feet, </span>receiving Your words” (Deuteronomy 33:3), and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef teaches: These are Torah scholars who pound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mekhatetim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] their feet from city to city and from country to country to study Torah; “receiving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yissa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Your words,” to discuss [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lissa</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">velitten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the utterances of God.</span>
And you have transgressed the words of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Prophets, as it is written: “Though they have hired lovers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitnu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] among the nations, now I will gather them, and they will begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of kings and princes” </span>(Hosea 8:10). With regard to this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>Part of <span class="gemarra-regular">this verse is stated in the Aramaic language; </span>the word <span class="it-text">yitnu</span> should be understood here in its Aramaic sense: To learn. And the verse should be interpreted as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If all </span>of Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">learns </span>Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will gather them </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">now; and if </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a few of them </span>learn Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">they will be excused from the burden </span>imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">by kings and princes. </span>This indicates that those who study Torah should not be subject to paying taxes.
And furthermore, you have transgressed the words of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Writings, as it is written: “It shall not be lawful to impose tribute, impost or toll upon them” </span>(Ezra 7:24), i.e., upon the priests and Levites who serve in the Temple. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply to Torah scholars as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: “Tribute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the king’s portion, </span>a tax given to the king. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Impost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the head tax</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “Toll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arnona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> paid with property that was imposed from time to time.
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">imposed </span>a tax for <span class="gemarra-regular">the digging of a new </span>cistern even <span class="gemarra-regular">on orphans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said to Rav Pappa: Perhaps </span>they will dig, but in the end <span class="gemarra-regular">they will not draw </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>from there, and it will turn out that the money will have been spent for nothing. The rest of the townspeople can relinquish their rights to their money, but orphans who are minors cannot do so. Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I shall collect </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the orphans; <span class="gemarra-regular">if they draw </span>water, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, I will return </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the orphans.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: All </span>of the city’s residents must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the building and upkeep of <span class="gemarra-regular">the city gates [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’aglei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and for this purpose money is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">even from orphans. But the Sages do not require protection </span>and are therefore exempt from this payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>of the city’s residents must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to the digging of cisterns [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekarya</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">patya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and for this purpose money is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the Sages, </span>since they too need water. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the people are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">go out en masse [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’akhluza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and do the actual digging, but are obligated merely to contribute money for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the people are required to <span class="gemarra-regular">go out en masse </span>and actually dig, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>expected to <span class="gemarra-regular">go out </span>with them <span class="gemarra-regular">en masse, </span>but rather they are exempt from such labor.
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi once <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">storehouses </span>to distribute food <span class="gemarra-regular">during years of drought. He said: Masters of Bible, masters of Mishna, masters of Talmud, masters of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, masters of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may enter </span>and receive food from me, <span class="gemarra-regular">but ignoramuses should not enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whom Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not know, <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed </span>his way in, <span class="gemarra-regular">and entered, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">sustain me. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: My son, have you read </span>the Bible? Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him, </span>out of modesty: <span class="gemarra-regular">No. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have you studied </span>Mishna? Once again, Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, by what </span>merit <span class="gemarra-regular">should I sustain you? </span>Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Sustain me like a dog and like a raven, </span>who are given food even though they have not learned anything. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was moved by his words and <span class="gemarra-regular">fed him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rabbi Yonatan <span class="gemarra-regular">left, Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">sat, and was distressed, and said: Woe is me, that I have given my bread to an ignoramus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> His son, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perhaps he was your disciple Yonatan ben Amram, who never in his life wanted to </span>materially <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from the honor </span>shown to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah? They investigated </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">and found </span>that such was the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Let everyone enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as there may also be others who hide the fact that they are true Torah scholars.
Commenting on Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, the Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi conformed <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Suffering comes to the world only due to ignoramuses. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the incident of <span class="gemarra-regular">the crown tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was imposed on </span>the residents of the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tiberias. </span>The heads of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: The Sages should contribute </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with us. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: No, </span>the Sages are exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">we will run away </span>and the entire burden will fall on the Torah scholars. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Run away </span>as you please. <span class="gemarra-regular">Half </span>of the city’s residents <span class="gemarra-regular">ran away. </span>The authorities then <span class="gemarra-regular">waived half </span>the sum that they had initially imposed on the city.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The half </span>of the population that remained in the city then <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Sages should contribute </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with us. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: No, </span>the Sages are exempt. They said to him: Then <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">will run away. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Run away </span>as you please. <span class="gemarra-regular">They all ran away, </span>so that only <span class="gemarra-regular">one launderer was left </span>in the city. The authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">imposed </span>the entire tax <span class="gemarra-regular">on the launderer. The launderer </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">ran away </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">The crown tax was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">canceled </span>in its entirety. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: You see </span>from this <span class="gemarra-regular">that suffering comes to the world only due to ignoramuses, </span>for as soon as they all fled from the city, the crown tax was completely canceled.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how long </span>must one live <span class="gemarra-regular">in the city to be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city? </span>Twelve months. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we raise a contradiction </span>from what is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey caravan or a camel carava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was journeying from place to place, and it lodged inside </span>an idolatrous city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">were led astray </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the other residents of the city, and they too engaged in idol worship, <span class="gemarra-regular">they, </span>the members of the caravan, are liable to death <span class="gemarra-regular">by stoning </span>like ordinary individual idolaters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their property escapes </span>destruction, i.e., they are not treated like the residents of an idolatrous city, who are liable to death by the sword and whose property is destroyed.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the caravan members <span class="gemarra-regular">had remained </span>in that city for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days, they </span>are liable to death <span class="gemarra-regular">by the sword and their property is destroyed, </span>just as it is for the rest of the residents of the city. This seems to indicate that once an individual has lived in a city for thirty days, he is already considered one of its residents.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>period, i.e., twelve months, is required in order to be considered one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of the city; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>period, i.e., thirty days, suffices in order to be considered one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the city. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from the people of a </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from deriving benefit from anyone who has stayed there </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months, </span>but it is permitted for him to derive benefit from anyone who has stayed there for <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">than that. </span>By contrast, if he prohibited himself by way of a vow from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the residents of a </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from deriving benefit from anyone who has stayed there </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for him to derive benefit from </span>anyone who has stayed there for <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">than that.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do we require </span>that one live in a city for <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months for all matters? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one lives in city for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days, </span>he must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">charity platte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from which food is distributed to the poor. If he lives there for <span class="gemarra-regular">three months, </span>he must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the charity <span class="gemarra-regular">box. </span>If he lives there for <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>months, he must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">clothing </span>fund. If he lives there for <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>months, he must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">burial </span>fund. If he lives there for <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span>months, he must contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">columns of the city [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lepassei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’ir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., for the construction of a security fence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When we learned twelve months in the mishna, we learned </span>that with regard to contributing <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">columns of the city, </span>money used for protecting and strengthening the city, but not for other matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All </span>are required to contribute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">columns of the city, and </span>money is collected for that purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">even from orphans. But the Sages </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to contribute, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the Sages do not need protection. Rav Pappa said: </span>Money is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">even from orphans for the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">wall, for the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">horseman, and for the guard [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uletarzina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of the city armory, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Sages do not require protection. The principle of the matter </span>is: Money is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">even from orphans </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">anything from which they </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit.</span>
It is reported that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba imposed </span>a contribution to a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">charity on the orphans of the house of bar Maryon. Abaye said to him: But didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda teach: One does not impose a charity </span>obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">on orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">redeeming captives, </span>since they are minors and are not obligated in the mitzvot? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I did this to elevate them </span>in standing, i.e., so that people should honor them as generous benefactors; not in order that the poor should benefit.
Incidental to this story, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ifera Hurmiz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mother of King Shapur, </span>king of Persia, <span class="gemarra-regular">sent a purse [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arneka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> full <span class="gemarra-regular">of dinars to Rav Yosef. She said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the money be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for a great mitzva. Rav Yosef sat and considered </span>the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>did Ifera Hurmiz mean when she attached a condition to the gift, saying that it should be used for <span class="gemarra-regular">a great mitzva? Abaye said to him: From what Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda taught, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not impose a charity </span>obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">on orphans even for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">redeeming captives, learn from this</span>

Daf 8b

that <span class="gemarra-regular">redeeming captives is a great mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter that the Sages stated, that redeeming captives is a great mitzva, from where is </span>it derived? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, when they say to you: To where shall we depart? Then you shall tell them: So says the Lord: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for famine, to famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity” </span>(Jeremiah 15:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whichever </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">later in this verse is more severe than the one </span>before it.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sword is worse than death. If you wish, say </span>that this is learned from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse; if you wish, say </span>instead that it is derived by way of <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning. If you wish, say </span>that this is derived by way of <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning: This </span>punishment, i.e., death by sword, <span class="gemarra-regular">mutilates </span>the body, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that </span>punishment, i.e., natural death, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not mutilate </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that the fact that the sword is worse than death is learned from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse: “Precious in the sight of the Lor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the death of His pious ones” </span>(Psalms 116:15).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Famine is worse than the sword. If you wish, say </span>that this is derived by way of <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning: This one, </span>who dies of famine, <span class="gemarra-regular">suffers </span>greatly before departing from this world, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that one, </span>who dies by the sword, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not suffer. If you wish, say </span>instead that the fact that famine is worse than the sword is learned from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse: “More fortunate were the victims of the sword than the victims of famine” </span>(Lamentations 4:9). And <span class="gemarra-regular">captivity is worse than all of them, as it includes all of them, </span>i.e., famine, the sword, and death.
§ In connection with the previous discussion concerning charity distribution, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>Money for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is collected by two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">and distributed by three </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is collected by two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">because one does not appoint an authority over the community </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of fewer than two </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is distributed by three people, like </span>the number of judges needed in cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the distributors determine who receives money and who does not, as well as how much each person receives.
Food for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity platte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is collected by three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">and distributed by three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">because its collection and its distribution </span>take place on <span class="gemarra-regular">the same </span>day. Food for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity platter </span>is collected and distributed <span class="gemarra-regular">every day, </span>and therefore a third individual must participate in the collection so that he will be available to take part in the distribution without delay; whereas the money of <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fund </span>is distributed only once a week, on <span class="gemarra-regular">each Shabbat eve.</span>
There are additional differences between these two types of charity operations: The food from <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity platter </span>is distributed <span class="gemarra-regular">to the poor of the world, </span>meaning, to any poor individual arriving in the city; the money of <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fund </span>is allocated exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">to the poor of the city. But it is permitted for the residents of the city to use </span>money that has been collected for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fund </span>to purchase food for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity platter </span>to feed the poor; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly they may use food that had been collected for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity platter </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fund. </span>In general, it is permitted for them <span class="gemarra-regular">to change </span>the purpose toward which charity will be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to whatever they want</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in accordance with the needs of the community.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for the residents of the city to set the measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> used in that city, <span class="gemarra-regular">the prices </span>set for products sold there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wages </span>paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">workers, and to fine </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">for violating their </span>specifications, in order to enforce observance of these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. This marks the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the details of which the Gemara proceeds to analyze.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One does not appoint an authority over the community </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of fewer than two </span>people. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that this is derived from a verse referring to those engaged in building the Tabernacle and weaving the priestly vestments, who received the community’s donations. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And they shall take the gold, </span>and the sky-blue wool, and the purple wool” (Exodus 28:5). The plural “they” indicates that the collection must be performed by two people.
The Gemara comments: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">authority may not be exercised </span>by less than two people, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>even a single individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is truste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to be a treasurer. That is, money for the charity fund is collected by two people, not because a single individual is not trusted not to misappropriate the money, but rather because a single individual should not be given authority over the community. <span class="gemarra-regular">This supports </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: There was an incident where Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed two brothers to </span>administer <span class="gemarra-regular">the charity fund. </span>Even though the brothers were relatives who are not trusted to testify against each other, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was not concerned and he appointed them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What authority </span>is associated with collecting charity? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: Because they can seize collateral for the charity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> i.e., they can collect charity by force, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even on Shabbat eve, </span>when people are busy and might claim that they have no time or money. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “I will punish all that oppress them” </span>(Jeremiah 30:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav: And </span>punishment will be meted out <span class="gemarra-regular">even to charity collectors? </span>If charity collectors are permitted to force people to contribute charity, why are they counted among Israel’s oppressors?
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This, </span>Rabbi Naḥman’s statement, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the contributor is <span class="gemarra-regular">rich, </span>in which case the collectors may seize money from him even by force. <span class="gemarra-regular">That, </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not rich, </span>in which case the collectors who take money from him by force are termed oppressors of Israel. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>right to force contributions from the rich is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>what occurred in the incident in which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava compelled Rav Natan bar Ami and took four hundred dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from him for charity.</span>
Having raised the issue of charity collection, the Gemara cites various rabbinic expositions with regard to the matter. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament; </span>and they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever” (Daniel 12:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is a judge who judges an absolutely true judgment, </span>as his wisdom and understanding lead him to a correct judgment. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they who turn many to righteousnes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like the stars for ever and ever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are the charity collectors, </span>who facilitate the giving of charity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is a judge who judges an absolutely true judgment and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">charity collectors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are schoolteachers. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like whom? </span>Certainly not every schoolteacher is worthy of such accolades. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: For example, Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As </span>it is told that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">found Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat standing in a garden. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Have you abandoned your trust </span>and neglected your students? Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It has been thirteen years </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">that I have not seen </span>my garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even now my thoughts are on </span>the children.
In light of the praises heaped upon judges, tax collectors, and schoolteachers, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>was said about <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages? Ravina said </span>that about them it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But let them that love Him be as the sun when it comes out in its might” </span>(Judges 5:31).
The Gemara resumes its discussion of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of charity collection: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Charity collectors may not separate from each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> each one collecting in a different place; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a place where the two can see each other, one collector <span class="gemarra-regular">may separate </span>from the other, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one going <span class="gemarra-regular">to the gate </span>of a house <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one going <span class="gemarra-regular">to a store. </span>If a charity collector <span class="gemarra-regular">found coins in the market</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may not put them into his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">pocket, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he must put them into the charity purse, and </span>then later <span class="gemarra-regular">when he comes home, he may take them </span>from there. This is necessary so that people should not suspect him of taking charity money for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, </span>if the charity collector <span class="gemarra-regular">was owed one hundred dinars by another, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in the market, </span>the collector <span class="gemarra-regular">may not put </span>the money he received <span class="gemarra-regular">into his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">pocket, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he must put it into the charity purse, and </span>then later <span class="gemarra-regular">when he comes home, he may take it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Charity collectors who have no poor people to </span>whom they can <span class="gemarra-regular">distribute </span>the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">may exchange </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">poretin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> the money, i.e., exchange the copper coins, which tend to rust, for silver dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">with other </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they should not change it </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves, </span>i.e., with their own coins, to avoid any suspicion of wrongdoing. Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">collectors </span>of food <span class="gemarra-regular">for the charity platter who do not have poor people </span>to whom <span class="gemarra-regular">to distribute </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">may sell </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">to others, but they should not sell it to themselves, </span>for a similar reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">Coins of charity are not counted two </span>by two, <span class="gemarra-regular">but rather one by one, </span>to avoid errors in tallying.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: At first, </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">would not sit on the mats in the synagogu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>they had been purchased with charity funds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he heard that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that it is permitted for the residents of a city <span class="gemarra-regular">to change </span>the purpose toward which charity will be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to whatever they want, he did sit </span>on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: At first, </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">would make two purses, one for the poor of </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the world, and one for the poor of his city. Once he heard what Shmuel said to Rav Taḥalifa bar Avdimi: Make </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one purse, </span>

Daf 9a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and stipulate about it </span>with the people of your city that the money collected will be given to whomever needs it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he too made </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one purse and stipulated </span>with the people of his city <span class="gemarra-regular">about it. Rav Ashi said: I do not even need to make a stipulation, as whoever comes </span>to donate to this charity fund <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>relying <span class="gemarra-regular">on my discretion and </span>understanding that <span class="gemarra-regular">I will give </span>the funds <span class="gemarra-regular">to whomever I want.</span>
The Gemara relates: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">these two butchers who made an agreemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with each other that whichever one of them worked on the day </span>assigned <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other </span>according to their mutually agreed-upon schedule <span class="gemarra-regular">would tear up the hide </span>of the animal that he slaughtered that day. <span class="gemarra-regular">One of them went and worked on the other’s day, and </span>the other butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">tore up the hide </span>of the animal that he slaughtered. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rava </span>for judgment, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava obligated him to pay </span>the butcher who slaughtered that animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya raised an objection to Rava: </span>Isn’t it stated among actions that the residents of a city may take: <span class="gemarra-regular">And to fine </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">for violating their </span>specifications, i.e., those ordinances that the residents passed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava did not respond to him. Rav Pappa said: He did well that he did not respond to him, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no important perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in the city, in which case it is permitted for the residents of the city to draw up ordinances on their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">But where there is an important person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not in </span>the residents’ <span class="gemarra-regular">power to make stipulations, </span>i.e., regulations; rather, they are required to obtain the approval of the city’s leading authority to give force to their regulations.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One does not calculate </span>sums <span class="gemarra-regular">with charity collector</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concerning </span>the money they collected <span class="gemarra-regular">for charity, </span>to verify how much they received and how much they distributed, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>does one calculate sums <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">treasurers concerning </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>to the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though there is no </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">proof of the matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from the Bible, there is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen; for they dealt in good faith” </span>(II Kings 12:16).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Even though a person has a trusted treasurer in his house </span>like the aforementioned Temple treasurers, who were fully trusted, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">tie up </span>his money <span class="gemarra-regular">and count </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“And the king’s scribe and the High Priest came up, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they tied </span>it in bags <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counted </span>the money…And they gave the money that was counted into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the House of the Lord” (II Kings 12:11–12).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>Charity collectors <span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span>the level of poverty of one who asks <span class="gemarra-regular">for food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but they do not examine </span>the level of poverty of one who asks <span class="gemarra-regular">for clothing. </span>If a person comes before the charity collectors in tattered clothes, he is given clothing without any questions being asked. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that this distinction is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse; if you wish, say </span>instead that it is derived via <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that this distinction is derived via <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning: This one </span>who stands before us in rags <span class="gemarra-regular">is exposed to contempt, whereas that one </span>who is hungry <span class="gemarra-regular">is not exposed to contempt. If you wish, say </span>instead that this distinction is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse, </span>as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Is it not to share </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">paros</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your bread with the hungry?” </span>(Isaiah 58:7). The word <span class="it-text">paros</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is written with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> alluding to the word <span class="it-text">parosh</span>, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span>and investigate, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>should you <span class="gemarra-regular">give him. And there </span>in the same verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>with regard to clothing: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When you see the naked, that you cover him,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">“when you see” </span>him you should <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span>cover him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>just the opposite: Charity collectors <span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span>the level of poverty of one who asks <span class="gemarra-regular">for clothing, but they do not examine </span>the level of poverty of one who asks <span class="gemarra-regular">for food. </span>He too adduces supports for his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that this distinction is derived via <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning; if you wish, say </span>instead that it is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that this distinction is derived via <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning: This one </span>who is hungry <span class="gemarra-regular">suffers, whereas that one </span>who is in tattered clothing <span class="gemarra-regular">does not suffer </span>in the same way. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that this distinction is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse. Here, it is written: “Is it not to share </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">paros</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your bread with the hungry?” </span>meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">share </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, just as </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">is read. </span>Since the word is read with a <span class="it-text">samekh</span>, Rav Yehuda does not understand it as alluding to examining the recipient. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there, it is written: “When you see the naked, that you cover him,” </span>meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it will be </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">apparent to you, </span>after you have investigated the matter and found that the supplicant is deserving, then you shall cover him. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda: </span>If a poor person <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Cover me </span>with clothing, the charity collectors <span class="gemarra-regular">examine him; </span>but if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sustain me </span>with food, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not examine him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 8:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">One does not give a poor person who is traveling from place to place </span>requesting charity <span class="gemarra-regular">les</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than a loaf </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pundeyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one forty-eighth of a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, when the standard price of grain is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If the poor person <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeps </span>in that place, <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives him provisions for lodging. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">provisions for lodging? Rav Pappa said: A bed and a pillow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sadya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And if he <span class="gemarra-regular">spends Shabbat </span>in that place, <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives him food for three meals. </span>A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a poor person <span class="gemarra-regular">was going door to door </span>asking for charity, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">attend to him </span>and give him money from the charity fund.
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain poor person who was going door to door </span>requesting charity <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Pappa, </span>the local charity collector, but Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">did not attend to him. Rav Sama, son of Rav Yeiva, said to Rav Pappa: If the Master does not attend to him, nobody else will attend to him </span>either; <span class="gemarra-regular">should he </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die </span>of hunger? Rav Pappa said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a poor person <span class="gemarra-regular">was going door to door </span>asking for charity, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">attend to him? </span>Rav Sama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>That <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means to say that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">attend to him </span>and give him <span class="gemarra-regular">a large gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he is already collecting money as he goes door to door, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one does attend to him </span>and give him <span class="gemarra-regular">a small gift.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: A person should never prevent himself from giving </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of a sheke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in charity, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And we also established mitzvot upon ourselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the House of our God” </span>(Nehemiah 10:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Asi says: Charity is equivalent to all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>combined, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“We also established mitzvot upon ourselves.” A mitzva is not written here, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>in the plural, thereby teaching that this mitzva is equivalent to all the other mitzvot.
The Gemara offers <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the following statements extolling the mitzva of charity: <span class="gemarra-regular">Greater; Temple; Moses. Rabbi Elazar says: One who causes others to perform [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’aseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>a meritorious act <span class="gemarra-regular">is greate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than one who performs </span>that act himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And the causing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’aseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of righteousnes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever” </span>(Isaiah 32:17). If one <span class="gemarra-regular">merits, </span>the following verse is applied to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?” </span>(Isaiah 58:7), i.e., he will wholeheartedly give charity to the poor. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not merit, </span>the latter clause of that verse is applied to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall bring the poor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that are cast ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to your house,” </span>i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and sustain them against his will.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to the people of Meḥoza: I beg of you, strive with each other </span>to perform acts of charity and righteousness, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that you will </span>live in <span class="gemarra-regular">peace with the government, </span>since if you do not act charitably toward each other, you will end up paying fines to the government. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar says: When the Temple is standing, a person contributes his sheke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> for the Temple service <span class="gemarra-regular">and achieves atonement </span>for his sins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that the Temple no longer stands, if </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">act charitably, </span>it will be <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>for them; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, the nations of the world </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will come and take </span>their money <span class="gemarra-regular">by force. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even so, </span>the money taken from them by force <span class="gemarra-regular">is credited to them as </span>if they had freely given <span class="gemarra-regular">charity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: </span>“And I will make <span class="gemarra-regular">your oppressors charity” </span>(Isaiah 60:17).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This </span>following matter <span class="gemarra-regular">was told to me </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the infant</span>

Daf 9b

<span class="gemarra-regular">who perverte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ways of his mother. </span>He said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And He donned charity like a coat of mail” </span>(Isaiah 59:17)? This verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this coat of mail, each and every scal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of which it is fashioned <span class="gemarra-regular">combines to </span>form <span class="gemarra-regular">one large coat of mail, so too </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">charity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each and every </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span> that one gives <span class="gemarra-regular">combines to </span>form <span class="gemarra-regular">a great sum. Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>The same idea is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>as it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And all our charity is as a polluted garment” </span>(Isaiah 64:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this garment, each and every thread </span>in it <span class="gemarra-regular">combines to </span>form <span class="gemarra-regular">one large garment, so too </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">charity, each and every </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> combines to </span>form <span class="gemarra-regular">a great sum.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why was </span>this Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">called the infant who perverted the ways of his mother? </span>It was because of the following incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami asked Rav Sheshet: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a lepe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">renders a person impure </span>through contact <span class="gemarra-regular">during his days of counting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., during the seven days that the leper must count from the start of his purification process, when he brings his birds, until he completes that process with the bringing of his sacrifices? Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Since he renders </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">garments impure, </span>as it states that on the seventh day of his purification he must wash his clothes (see Leviticus 14:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renders people impure.</span>
Rav Aḥadvoi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perhaps connected impurit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different, </span>meaning perhaps he renders his garments impure because they are connected to the source of the impurity, but this does not mean that he renders impure a person whom he touches. A proof for this distinction may be brought from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one moves an animal carcass</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an action that renders him impure even if there was no actual contact with the carcass, <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>that he is wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">impure but does not render </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">person impure.</span>
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But from where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do we </span>derive that the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal renders a person impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Is it not because </span>we know <span class="gemarra-regular">that it renders </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">garments impure? </span>Rav Aḥadvoi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is written explicitly </span>with regard to the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal: “Or a man who touches any creeping animal, </span>whereby he may be made unclean” (Leviticus 22:5). Rav Sheshet said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">semen renders a person impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Is it not because </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it renders </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">garments impure </span>(see Leviticus 15:17) <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renders a person impure? </span>Rav Aḥadvoi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is also written explicitly </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">semen: “Or a man </span>from whom semen is expelled” (Leviticus 22:4), and the Sages expound the superfluous word “or” as serving <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>as impure <span class="gemarra-regular">one who touches </span>semen.
The Gemara relates that with each of his answers Rav Aḥadvoi <span class="gemarra-regular">responded to </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">in a mocking tone, </span>intimating that he doubted Rav Sheshet’s grasp of Torah verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet was </span>deeply <span class="gemarra-regular">offended, </span>and as punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami became mute and forgot his learning. </span>Rav Aḥadvoi’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother came and wept before </span>Rav Sheshet. <span class="gemarra-regular">She cried and cried but he ignored her. </span>As she had once been Rav Sheshet’s nursemaid, <span class="gemarra-regular">she said to him: Look at these breasts of mine from which you suckled. </span>Upon hearing that, Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">prayed for mercy for </span>Rav Aḥadvoi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was healed. </span>And since it was Rav Aḥadvoi whose behavior led to his mother’s acting in this manner, he was referred to as the infant who perverted his mother’s ways.
The Gemara comments: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we arrived at, </span>i.e., this particular subject, let us clarify the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that a leper renders impure a person with whom he comes into contact during his days of counting? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai says: Washing garments is stated with respect to his days of counting, and washing garments is stated with respect to his days of confirmed </span>leprosy, after he has been declared conclusively impure by a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>when he is a confirmed leper <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders a person impure, </span>as is explicitly stated in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>during his days of counting <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders a person impure.</span>
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the virtues of giving charity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: One who performs </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity in secret is greater than Moses, our teacher. Whereas with regard to Moses, our teacher, it is written: “For I was afraid of the anger and the wrath” </span>(Deuteronomy 9:19), <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who performs </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity it is written: “A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a present in the bosom fierce wrath” </span>(Proverbs 21:14). The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: </span>A secret gift <span class="gemarra-regular">pacifies anger, </span>but it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pacify wrath, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom fierce wrath,” </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">although a present is in the bosom, </span>i.e., even if one gives charity in secret, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">fierce wrath </span>can still harm him. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any judge who accepts a bribe brings fierce wrath upon the world, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom </span>fierce wrath.”
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Anyone who gives a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a poor person receives six blessings, and whoever consoles hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with word</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of comfort and encouragement <span class="gemarra-regular">receives eleven blessings. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who gives a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a poor person receives six blessings, as it is written: “Is it not to share </span>your bread with the hungry, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, </span>that you cover him” (Isaiah 58:7). And the next verses list six blessings: “Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily, and your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard. Then, shall you call, and the Lord shall answer; you shall cry, and He shall say: Here I am” (Isaiah 58:8–9).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And whoever consoles </span>a poor person <span class="gemarra-regular">with words </span>of comfort and encouragement <span class="gemarra-regular">receives eleven blessings, as it is stated: “And if you draw out your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall your light shine in darkness, and your gloom shall be as the noonday. And the Lord shall guide you continually, and satisfy your thirst in drought… And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places, you shall raise up the foundations of many generations” </span>(Isaiah 58:10–12).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity, and honor” </span>(Proverbs 21:21)? Is this to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">because one has pursued charity, he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">shall find charity? </span>That is, shall the reward of one who has always given charity be that he will eventually become poor and other people will act charitably toward him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who pursues charity, </span>giving to the poor and leading others to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, furnishes him with money with which to perform </span>his acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, sends him people who are deserving of charity, so that he will reap </span>his just <span class="gemarra-regular">reward for </span>helping <span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does this statement serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? </span>It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude Rabba’s homiletical interpretation </span>of a different verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabba taught: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal thus with them in the time of Your anger” </span>(Jeremiah 18:23)? The prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when </span>those wicked men who pursued me <span class="gemarra-regular">subdue their inclinations and seek to perform </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity before You, cause them to stumble upon </span>dishonest <span class="gemarra-regular">people who are not deserving </span>of charity, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they will not receive reward </span>for coming to their assistance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who is accustomed to performing </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity merits </span>blessing; <span class="gemarra-regular">he will have sons who are masters of wisdom, masters of wealth, and masters of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Masters of wisdom, as it is written: </span>

Daf 10a

“He who pursues charity and mercy, <span class="gemarra-regular">finds life” </span>(Proverbs 21:21), and with regard to wisdom it is written: “He who finds Me, finds life” (Proverbs 8:35). <span class="gemarra-regular">Masters of wealth, as it is written: </span>“He who pursues charity and mercy finds <span class="gemarra-regular">charity,” </span>meaning he will be able to give charity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Masters of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is written: </span>“He who pursues charity and mercy, finds <span class="gemarra-regular">honor.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> And how do we know that this refers to masters of <span class="it-text">aggada</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written here “honor,” and it is written there: “The wise shall inherit honor” </span>(Proverbs 3:35).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: An opponent may bring an argument against you and say to you: If your God loves the poor, for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">does He not support them </span>Himself? In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>He commands us to act as His agents in sustaining the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that through them we will be </span>credited with the performance of mitzvot and therefore be <span class="gemarra-regular">saved from the judgment of Gehenna. And this is the question that Turnus Rufu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wicked asked Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If your God loves the poor, for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">does He not support them </span>Himself? Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>He commands us to sustain the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that through them </span>and the charity we give them <span class="gemarra-regular">we will be saved from the judgment of Gehenna.</span>
Turnus Rufus <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, it is this </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">which condemns you, </span>the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">to Gehenna </span>because you give it. <span class="gemarra-regular">I will illustrate </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to you with a parable. To what is this matter comparable? </span>It is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his slave and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this, would he not be angry with </span>that person? <span class="gemarra-regular">And you, </span>after all, <span class="gemarra-regular">are called slaves, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me” </span>(Leviticus 25:55). If God decreed that a certain person should be impoverished, one who gives him charity defies the will of God.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to </span>Turnus Rufus: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will illustrate </span>the opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">to you with a </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">parable. To what is this matter comparable? </span>It is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his son and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard </span>about this once his anger abated, <span class="gemarra-regular">would he not </span>react by <span class="gemarra-regular">sending </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of the Lord your God” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:1).
Turnus Rufus <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You are called sons and you are called slaves. When you fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called sons; when you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called slaves. And </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">now you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, </span>the parable that I offered is more apt. Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house?” </span>(Isaiah 58:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>do we <span class="gemarra-regular">bring the poor that are cast out </span>into our <span class="gemarra-regular">houses? Now, </span>when we have to billet the Roman soldiers in our homes; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>about that very time, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shalom taught: Just as a person’s </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">livelihoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is allocated to him from Rosh HaShana, </span>when God issues His judgments for the entire year, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too are a person’s </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">losses allocated to him from Rosh HaShana. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one merits, </span>the following verse is applied to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall share your bread with the hungry,” </span>i.e., he will spend the sum allocated to him on gifts of charity; and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not merit, </span>the following verse is applied to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house, </span>i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and feed them against his will.
It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">involving the nephews of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, </span>who once <span class="gemarra-regular">saw in a dream that </span>his nephews <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>destined <span class="gemarra-regular">to lose seven hundred dinars </span>over the course of the year. <span class="gemarra-regular">He encouraged them </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from them for charity, and they were left with seventeen dinars </span>out of the seven hundred. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Yom Kippur eve arrived, the government sent </span>messengers who came and <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the remaining seventeen dinars.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to them: Do not fear </span>that they will take even more from you; <span class="gemarra-regular">they took from you </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seventeen dinars</span> that were still <span class="gemarra-regular">with you. </span>The nephews <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: How did you know? </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I saw a dream about you, </span>and he related his dream to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: And why did you not tell us </span>about the dream? Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I said, </span>It is better <span class="gemarra-regular">that they perform a mitzva for its own sake. </span>Had you known from the start that you were fated to lose that amount of money, the mitzva would not have been performed purely for its own sake.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">climbing </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">a ladder </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">his foot slipped and he almost fell. He said: Now, is the one who hates us, </span>a euphemism for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">liable like Shabbat desecrator</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and idol worshippers, </span>who are subject to death by stoning, which is similar to death by falling, the punishment that Rav Pappa narrowly escaped? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti said to Rav Pappa: Perhaps a poor person </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">approached you and you did not sustain him, </span>and therefore you were given a glimpse of the punishment that you actually deserve.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Anyone who turns his eyes away from </span>one seeking <span class="gemarra-regular">charit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he worships idols. </span>From where is this derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written here: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart…</span>and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written there: “Certain base men have gone out…</span>and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the base men sin with <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry, so too here, </span>the base thought is treated like <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: All </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity and kindness that Jews perform in this world </span>make <span class="gemarra-regular">great peace and </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">great intercessors between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, enter not into a house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them, for I have taken away My peac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this people, </span>says the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">both kindness and mercy” </span>(Jeremiah 16:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">“Kindness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">acts of kindness. “Mercy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity. </span>This indicates that when there is kindness and mercy, God is at peace with His people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Great is charity in that it advances the redemption</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “So said the Lord, uphold justice and do charity, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed” </span>(Isaiah 56:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">He would say: Ten strong entities were created in the world, </span>one stronger than the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">A mountain is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">iron, </span>which is stronger, <span class="gemarra-regular">cleaves it. Iron is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">fire melts it. Fire is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">water extinguishes it. Water is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">clouds bear it. Clouds are strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">wind disperses them. Wind is strong, </span>but the human <span class="gemarra-regular">body withstands it. </span>The human <span class="gemarra-regular">body is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">fear breaks it. Fear is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">wine dispels it. Wine is strong, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep drives it off. And death is stronger than them all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but charity saves </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">from death, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death” </span>(Proverbs 10:2, 11:4).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, taught: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like the attribute of flesh and blood. </span>An illustration of <span class="gemarra-regular">the attribute of flesh and blood </span>is that when <span class="gemarra-regular">a person brings a great gift to the king, it is uncertain whether </span>the king <span class="gemarra-regular">will accept it from him or will not accept it from him. And if you say that </span>the king <span class="gemarra-regular">will accept it from him, it is uncertain whether </span>the person who brought the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">see the face of the king, or will not see the face of the king. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not </span>act in <span class="gemarra-regular">this way. </span>Even when <span class="gemarra-regular">a person gives a </span>mere <span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a poor person, he merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “As for me, I will behold Your face through charity; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness” </span>(Psalms 17:15).
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar would </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">give a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to a poor person and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>would he <span class="gemarra-regular">pray</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said: As it is written </span>in the same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I will behold Your face through charity.” </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of that which is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I will be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness”?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: These are Torah scholars, </span>who in pursuit of their studies <span class="gemarra-regular">banish sleep from their eye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this world, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, satiates them with the radiance of the Divine Presence in the World-to-Come.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “He that graciously gives to the poor makes a loan to the Lord, </span>and that which he has given, He will pay him back” (Proverbs 19:17)? How can it be that one is considered to have granted a loan to God? <span class="gemarra-regular">Were it not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this, </span>that somebody who is gracious to a poor person is seen as lending to God. It would be impertinent, since <span class="gemarra-regular">“the borrower is servant to the lender” </span>(Proverbs 22:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">as it were.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a contradiction </span>between two texts. In one place <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Riches profit not on the day of wrath, but charity delivers from death” </span>(Proverbs 11:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>elsewhere <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but charity delivers from death” </span>(Proverbs 10:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is it necessary to have <span class="gemarra-regular">these two </span>verses about <span class="gemarra-regular">charity, </span>that it delivers from death? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>verse serves to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">delivers from an unnatural deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> in this world, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>verse serves to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">delivers from the judgment of Gehenna </span>in the World-to-Come. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>of the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">is that </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">which delivers from the judgment of Gehenna </span>mentioned? It is in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">in which “wrath” is written, as </span>with regard to the day of judgment <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “That day is a day of wrath” </span>(Zephaniah 1:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">And which </span>type of charity <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which delivers from an unnatural death? </span>

Daf 10b

It is the type in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives </span>the charity <span class="gemarra-regular">without knowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to whom he gave it, </span>and the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one takes it without knowing from whom he took it. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One gives it without knowing to whom he gave it, </span>this serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of Mar Ukva, </span>who would personally give charity to poor people without their knowing he was the donor. The other one <span class="gemarra-regular">takes it without knowing from whom he took it; </span>this serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abba, </span>who would render his money ownerless, so that poor people would come and take it without his knowing whom he helped, although they would know from whom the money came. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, how </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">should one act </span>to conceal his own identity and also remain ignorant of the identities of the recipients? The Gemara answers: The best method is <span class="gemarra-regular">to put </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">into the charity purse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from what is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What should a person do to have male offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer says: He should distribute his money liberally among the poor. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He should gladden his wife before </span>engaging in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>of conjugal relations. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A person should not donate a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the charity purse unless </span>a great and trusted individual <span class="gemarra-regular">like Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is appointed </span>as supervisor <span class="gemarra-regular">over it. </span>This seems to indicate that putting money into the charity box is not always preferred. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we say </span>that putting money into the charity box is the preferred way to give charity, this is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">like Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon is appointed </span>as supervisor <span class="gemarra-regular">over it.</span>
The Gemara discusses other matters concerning charity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, with what shall the horn of Israel be exalted? </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With </span>the passage of <span class="gemarra-regular">“When you raise,” </span>i.e., Israel will be exalted by way of the donations and charity that they will give, as it is stated: “When you raise the heads of the children of Israel…then shall they give” (Exodus 30:12).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon, son of David: How far does the power of charity extend? </span>King Solomon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Go out and see what my father David explained: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn shall be exalted with honor” </span>(Psalms 112:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span>It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>how far the power of charity extends: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks; his bread shall be given, his water shall be sure” </span>(Isaiah 33:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks”? Because “his bread shall be given” </span>to the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “his water shall be sure,” </span>i.e., it shall be given faithfully and he can be trusted in the matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon: Who is one </span>who is destined <span class="gemarra-regular">for the World-to-Come? </span>King Solomon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: All </span>those about whom it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And before His Elders will be His glory” </span>(Isaiah 24:23), referring to those who are honored in this world due to their wisdom. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, who became ill </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">fainted. </span>When he returned to good health, <span class="gemarra-regular">his father said to him: What did you see </span>when you were not conscious? Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I saw an inverted world. Those above, </span>i.e., those who are considered important in this world, were <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>insignificant, while <span class="gemarra-regular">those below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., those who are insignificant in this world, were <span class="gemarra-regular">above. </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have seen a clear world. </span>The world you have seen is the true world, one in which one’s spiritual and moral standing determines his true importance. Rabbi Yehoshua further asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how did you see us, </span>the Torah scholars, there? Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Just as we are important here, we are important there.</span>
Yosef added: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I heard that they were saying </span>in that world: <span class="gemarra-regular">Happy is the one who arrives with his studies in hand. And I </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that they were saying: Those executed by the government </span>enjoy such exalted status that <span class="gemarra-regular">no one can stand in their section. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are these </span>martyrs to whom Yosef was referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues, </span>who were killed by the Romans, this cannot be: Is their elevated status <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">they were martyred by</span> the Roman <span class="gemarra-regular">government and nothing more? </span>These men were exceptional in their piety and sanctity during their lives as well. Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that even without </span>their martyrdom they would be greater than other people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring to those like <span class="gemarra-regular">the martyrs of Lod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who died for the sanctification of God’s name but were not Torah scholars.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: My sons, what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which the verse states: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but the kindness of the peoples is sin” </span>(Proverbs 14:34)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth?” </span>(I Chronicles 17:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the kindness of the peoples is sin,” </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is </span>counted as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin for them, since they perform them only to elevate themselves </span>in prestige, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “That they may sacrifice offerings of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons” </span>(Ezra 6:10). Even though they donated offerings, they did so only for their own benefit.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if one acts this way, is it not full-fledged charity? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: </span>I am contributing <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to charity so that my sons will live, or </span>if he says: I am performing the mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">so that I will merit </span>a share in <span class="gemarra-regular">the World-to-Come, this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is a full-fledged righteous person, </span>as far as that mitzva is concerned, even though he has his own welfare in mind? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the statement that he is considered absolutely righteous is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the statement that such benefaction is not credited as charity is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a gentile.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua answered </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s challenge to interpret the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation </span>on the earth.” <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the kindness of the peoples is sin” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is </span>counted as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin for them, since they perform them only to perpetuate their dominion, as it is stated </span>by Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by charity, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; that there may be an extension of your serenity” </span>(Daniel 4:24). Since this is the argument that persuaded Nebuchadnezzar, it would appear that his actual motive was his own benefit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, </span>one nation on the earth.” <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the kindness of the peoples is sin” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is </span>counted as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin for them, since they perform them only in order to act haughtily through them, and whoever acts haughtily falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “The proud and haughty one, scorner is his name, acts in arrogant wrath” </span>(Proverbs 21:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">And wrath means nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath” </span>(Zephaniah 1:15).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said: We still need </span>to hear what <span class="gemarra-regular">the Moda’i </span>has to say, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer HaModa’i says: “Righteousness exalts a nation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth.” “But the kindness of the peoples is sin” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is </span>counted as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin for them, since they perform them only to taunt us with them, as it is stated </span>that the Babylonian officer Nebuzaradan said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The Lord has brought it, and done according as He has said; because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this matter is come upon you” </span>(Jeremiah 40:3).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation and kindness” </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel; and </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">“of the peoples is sin.” Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: The statement of Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana appears </span>to be more precise <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">my statement and your statements, because he assigns </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">righteousness and kindness to Israel, and sin to the peoples </span>of the world. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>it appears <span class="gemarra-regular">that he, </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <span class="gemarra-regular">also offered </span>an interpretation of this verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to them </span>that the verse should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a sin-offering atones for Israel, so charity atones for the nations of the world.</span>
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur, </span>king of Persia, <span class="gemarra-regular">sent four hundred dinars to Rabbi Ami, but he did not accept them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> She </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sent them to Rava, and he accepted them for the sake of peace with the kingdom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ami heard </span>what Rava had done <span class="gemarra-regular">and was angry. He said: Does </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">not accept </span>the lesson of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come and set them on fire” </span>(Isaiah 27:11), meaning that when righteousness has ceased from a particular nation, it is time for its citizens to be punished, and therefore we should not help them perform any meritorious deeds, which would delay their punishment? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>accept the money? The Gemara answers: He did so <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of peace with the kingdom.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>see the importance of accepting the money <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of peace with the kingdom? </span>The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ami maintains that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">should have distributed </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to the gentile poor </span>rather than to the Jewish poor, as it is a disgrace to the Jews to require the kindness of the nations of the world in order to support their poor. The Gemara comments: In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava also gave </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to the gentile poor </span>and not to the Jewish poor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ami got angry </span>because

Daf 11a

those who reported the story to him <span class="gemarra-regular">did not conclude it before him; </span>consequently, Rav Ami was not informed that Rava had indeed given the money to the gentile poor.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The following <span class="gemarra-regular">was said about Binyamin the righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was appointed </span>supervisor <span class="gemarra-regular">over the charity fund. Once, a woman came before him during years of drought </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: My master, sustain me. He said to her: </span>I swear <span class="gemarra-regular">by the Temple service that there is nothing </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">in the charity fund. She said to him: My master, if you do not sustain me, a woman and her seven sons will die. He arose and sustained her with his own </span>funds. <span class="gemarra-regular">After some time, he fell deathly ill. The ministering angels said to the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who preserve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a single life in Israel is </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he has preserved an entire world. Should </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Binyamin the righteous, who saved a woman and her seven sons, die after these few years, </span>still in his youth? <span class="gemarra-regular">They immediately tore up his sentence. </span>A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: They added twenty-two years to his life.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving King Munbaz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who liberally gave away his treasures and the treasures of his ancestors in the years of drought,</span> distributing the money to the poor. <span class="gemarra-regular">His brothers and his father’s household joined together against him </span>to protest against his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said to him: Your ancestors stored up </span>money in their treasuries <span class="gemarra-regular">and added to </span>the treasures <span class="gemarra-regular">of their ancestors, and you are liberally distributing </span>it all to the poor. King Munbaz <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>Not so, <span class="gemarra-regular">my ancestors stored up below, whereas I am storing above, as it is stated: “Truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness will look down from heaven” </span>(Psalms 85:12), meaning that the righteous deeds that one has performed are stored up in heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">My ancestors stored up </span>treasures <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where the </span>human <span class="gemarra-regular">hand can reach, </span>and so their treasures could have been robbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas I am storing up </span>treasures<span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place where the </span>human <span class="gemarra-regular">hand cannot reach, </span>and so they are secure, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne” </span>(Psalms 89:15).
<span class="gemarra-regular">My ancestors stored up something that does not generate profit, </span>as money sitting in a treasury does not increase, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas I am storing up something that generates profit, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous, that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings” </span>(Isaiah 3:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">My ancestors stored up treasures of money, whereas I am storing up treasures of souls, as it is stated: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise” </span>(Proverbs 11:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">My ancestors stored up for others, </span>for their sons and heirs, when they themselves would pass from this world, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas I am storing up for myself, as it is stated: “And it shall be as righteousness to you” </span>(Deuteronomy 24:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">My ancestors stored up for this world, whereas I am storing up for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard” </span>(Isaiah 58:8).
§ The Gemara resumes its analysis of the mishna, which taught that one must reside in a place for twelve months in order to be considered a resident for the purposes of issues such as paying taxes. But if he <span class="gemarra-regular">bought </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence in </span>the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>immediately considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If he bought any amount of land in </span>the city, and not necessarily a residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>immediately considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>otherwise in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">bought land that is suitable for a residence, he is </span>immediately considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city. </span>This contradicts the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara answers: This is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>they disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>at the request of one of the joint owners <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there will be </span>in it four by <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits for this one and </span>four by <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits for that one, </span>i.e., this minimum area for each of the joint owners. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divide <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">field unless there is </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for this one and nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for that one. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The court does not divide a field <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there is </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for this one and nine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for that one. And </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divide a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">garden unless there is </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for this one and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for that one. Rabbi Akiva says </span>that half that amount is sufficient, i.e., the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
Similarly, the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divide <span class="gemarra-regular">a hall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hateraklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a drawing room, a dovecote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cloak, a bathhouse, an olive press, and an irrigated fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there is enough for this one </span>to use the property in the usual manner <span class="gemarra-regular">and enough for that one </span>to use the property in the usual manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: Anything </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>when it <span class="gemarra-regular">is divided, </span>each of the parts is large enough to <span class="gemarra-regular">retain the name </span>of the original item, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">divides </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the parts will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>retain the original name, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not divide </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>does this rule apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the joint owners <span class="gemarra-regular">do not both wish </span>to divide the item; when only one of the owners wishes to divide the property, he cannot force the other to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when both of them wis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to divide the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may divide </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if each of the owners will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the amounts specified above. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings, </span>i.e., a scroll of any of the twenty-four books of the Bible, that were inherited by two people, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may not divide </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if both of them wish </span>to do so, because it would be a show of disrespect to cut the scroll in half.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The four cubits </span>of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">which they said </span>each of the joint owners must receive is <span class="gemarra-regular">in addition to </span>the space in front of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to each of the houses that is assigned to the owner of the house for loading and unloading. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not divide a courtyard unless </span>its area is sufficient so that <span class="gemarra-regular">there will be in it eight cubits for this one and eight cubits for that one. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that it suffices that there be <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits for this one and four cubits for that one? Rather, conclude from it </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Asi. </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that it is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who raise </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as a contradiction to what is taught in the mishna and use the previously mentioned point to reconcile the two texts. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not divide a courtyard </span>at the request of one of the joint owners <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there will be </span>in it four by <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits for this one and </span>four by <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits for that one. But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The court does not divide a courtyard unless there are <span class="gemarra-regular">eight cubits for this one and eight cubits for that one? </span>About this <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The four cubits </span>of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">which they said </span>each of the joint owners must receive is <span class="gemarra-regular">in addition to </span>the space in front of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrances </span>to each of the houses.
Further with regard to the division of a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: A courtyard is divided according to its entrances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Each of the owners receives a share of the courtyard in proportion to the number of entrances that his house has opening onto the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda says: Four cubits are allotted </span>to each of the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the rest </span>of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divided equally </span>between them.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda: </span>Each of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrances </span>opening <span class="gemarra-regular">to a courtyard </span>is allotted <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">this one has one entrance and that one has two entrances, the one who has one entrance takes four cubits, and the one who has two entrances takes eight cubits, and they divide the rest </span>of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">equally </span>between them. If <span class="gemarra-regular">this one had an entrance eight cubits wide, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">takes eight cubits adjacent to the entrance and four cubits in the courtyard. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits in the courtyard doing here? </span>Doesn’t it all depend on the size of the courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>For the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes eight cubits along the length of the courtyard and four cubits along the width of the courtyard. </span>In other words, he takes a strip four cubits wide along the entire length of his entrance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar says: A pit for </span>holding <span class="gemarra-regular">animal food </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eira</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">desuflei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has four cubits on each and every side </span>so that there will be sufficient space for the animals to stand. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">has no special entranc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to reach it, but rather it is accessed from all sides. 

Daf 11b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he designates an entrance </span>leading to this pit and does not approach it from all sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has four cubits only in front of his entrance.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: A portico [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhsadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that opens onto a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>the adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that four cubits were granted for each entrance? The four cubits were granted so that the owner would have room <span class="gemarra-regular">for unloading </span>his animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">its burden. Here he can go inside </span>the portico <span class="gemarra-regular">and unload. Rav Sheshet raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both gates of houses and gates of porticos have </span>the adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>for unloading. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the portico of a study hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is closed and is not used for unloading burdens. The Gemara expresses surprise at this answer: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">the portico of a study hall, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a proper room. Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Roman portico</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is more open than the portico of a study hall, but also not used for unloading.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A gatehouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico, and a balcony </span>with a staircase leading down to the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>for unloading. Even if <span class="gemarra-regular">five houses open onto the balcony, they only have four cubits </span>in front of the entrance to the staircase that leads to the balcony. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Yannai: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken coo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> that also has a staircase <span class="gemarra-regular">have four cubits or does it not have four cubits? </span>Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason </span>that four cubits are granted? It is so that the owner will have room <span class="gemarra-regular">for unloading </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">burden </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>this space is not needed, as the chickens <span class="gemarra-regular">climb u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> to get into the coop <span class="gemarra-regular">and climb down </span>to get out. No additional place is required for the owner to stand alongside them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava asked Rav Naḥman: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">half roofe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and half unroofed, does it have </span>the adjoining <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits or does it not have </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits? </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It does not have </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when the house’s <span class="gemarra-regular">roofing is </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">the inside </span>portion of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible </span>for the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to go inside and unload </span>his animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even </span>when the house’s <span class="gemarra-regular">roofing is </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">the outside </span>portion of the house, it is not given four cubits, as even in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible </span>for the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to go inside and unload </span>his animal there.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna asked Rabbi Ami: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of an alleyway </span>onto which several courtyards open <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to alter his entrance to a different alleyway, </span>i.e., to make an entrance to his courtyard that will open onto a different alleyway, can <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway prevent hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> from opening this entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">or can they not prevent him </span>from doing so? Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The residents of </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway can prevent him </span>from making the change.
Rav Huna further asked: When a king issues <span class="gemarra-regular">a billeting</span> order to the residents of a courtyard, obligating them to house his soldiers in their homes, is the burden <span class="gemarra-regular">divided according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in each household, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">divided according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances </span>that each house has opening into the courtyard? Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is divided according to the </span>number of <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>in each household. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The dung in a courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> which the residents wish to use <span class="gemarra-regular">is divided </span>among them <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances </span>that open into the courtyard, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">billeting </span>is divided <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>in each household.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of an alleyway wishes to close off </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to his entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to build a structure in the alleyway adjacent to the entrance to his courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the alleyway can prevent him </span>from doing so. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it will increase the way for them, </span>since they will have to circumvent the structure when going to and from their homes.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards open onto an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>the residents of the alleyway may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway that faces the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">the outermost </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the outermost </span>courtyard may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>only that part of the alleyway adjacent to <span class="gemarra-regular">its own </span>entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>courtyards may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway that faces <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>courtyard, i.e., the one next to the outermost courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>courtyard may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway adjacent to <span class="gemarra-regular">its own </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway facing <span class="gemarra-regular">the outermost </span>courtyard.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: The <span class="gemarra-regular">outcome </span>is that the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the innermost </span>courtyard may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway adjacent to <span class="gemarra-regular">its own </span>entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>that part of the alleyway facing <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span>other courtyard as well. According to this analysis, it should be permitted for the owner of the innermost courtyard to close off the area in front of his courtyard, since he is the only one who has permission to use it.
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of an alleyway wishes to alter his entrance to a different alleyway, the residents of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway can prevent him </span>from doing so. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there had been </span>an entrance there beforehand which is now <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed and he wishes to open it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway cannot prevent him </span>from doing so; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards which open onto an alleyway, </span>the residents of all the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">may all use the alleyway with each other.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise about this last ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Courtyards, who mentioned anything about them? </span>Why are they mentioned, considering that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not discussing the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of courtyards? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Additionally, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards which open onto an alleyway, </span>the residents of all the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">may all use </span>the area facing <span class="gemarra-regular">the outermost </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">outermost one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>only the area facing their <span class="gemarra-regular">own </span>entrance; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards which open onto an alleyway, </span>the residents of all the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">may all use the alleyway.</span>
The Gemara directs the discussion to the details mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there had been </span>an entrance there beforehand that is now <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed and he wishes to open it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway cannot prevent him </span>from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: This was taught only when he did not break its doorposts, </span>i.e., when the doorposts remained intact even after the entrance was sealed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he </span>sealed the entrance and <span class="gemarra-regular">broke its doorposts, </span>thereby demonstrating that the entrance had been completely negated, <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway can prevent him </span>from opening a new entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: </span>A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught which supports you:</span>

Daf 12a

<span class="gemarra-regular">A house </span>that has <span class="gemarra-regular">a sealed </span>entrance still <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>adjoining that entrance because the entrance can be reopened. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one broke its doorposts </span>and sealed the entrance, the entrance is completely negated, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>adjoining it.
There is a similar distinction with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity. There is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a house in which there is a corpse transmits ritual impurity only through its doorways. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">A grave whose entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is seale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not render all its surroundings ritually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure; </span>the ritual impurity extends only to the area opposite the entrance. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">one broke its doorposts and sealed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>it is no longer considered an entrance, and the grave <span class="gemarra-regular">renders all its surroundings ritually impure, </span>because impurity that has no egress bursts from all sides. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>in which there is a corpse that has <span class="gemarra-regular">a sealed </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">does not rende</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all its surroundings ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But if <span class="gemarra-regular">one broke its doorposts, </span>it is no longer considered an entrance, and the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">renders all of its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> surroundings ritually impure.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyways that are open to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and through which one would ordinarily travel to reach that other city, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city </span>in which the alleyways are located <span class="gemarra-regular">wished to block</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>off, <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the city </span>into which the alleyways open <span class="gemarra-regular">can prevent them </span>from doing so, because they have a right to reach their city via those routes. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to state <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they can prevent </span>them from blocking the alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">when there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no alternative route </span>to reach their town, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can prevent </span>them from blocking the alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">even when there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an alternative route.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the reasoning that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says. As Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>One is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from ruining a path that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public has establishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> as a public thoroughfare, i.e., steps may not be taken to prevent people from using it. This is in accordance with the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Giddel, as Rav Giddel says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the public has chosen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a route for itself </span>and they walk on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they have chosen is chosen, </span>and it cannot be taken away from them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyways that open onto a public thoroughfare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents of the alleyways wished to put up doors </span>at the entrance to their alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">the people </span>who use <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public thoroughfare can prevent them </span>from doing so.
Some Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">understood from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies specifically to the area <span class="gemarra-regular">within four cubits </span>of the public thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Zeira </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says, as Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman says: The four cubits </span>in an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adjacent to the public thoroughfare are considered like the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thoroughfare </span>itself. Consequently, this area has the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a public thoroughfare. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. There, </span>the ruling of Rav Naḥman was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the issue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to which only the first four cubits of the alleyway are considered like the public thoroughfare. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>with regard to doors set up at the entrance to the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes the public thoroughfare</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> becomes crowded with people and they enter far </span>into the alleyway, even farther than four cubits.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divide a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">field unless there is </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for this one and nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed <span class="gemarra-regular">for that one. </span>Rabbi Yehuda says: The court does not divide a field unless there is space in it to plant nine half-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed for this one and nine half-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed for that one. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree </span>with regard to the fundamental <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the custom of <span class="gemarra-regular">his locale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the custom of <span class="gemarra-regular">his locale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In Rabbi Yehuda’s locale, even a smaller parcel of land was considered a viable field.
The Gemara asks: The mishna was taught in Eretz Yisrael; <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>practice should be followed <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef said: </span>In Babylonia, a parcel of land the size of which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> area of a day’s plowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> is considered a field; if each of the parties will receive less than that, the field should not be divided.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by a parcel of land the size of which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the area </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a day’s plowing? If </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">a day’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span>plowing in <span class="gemarra-regular">the planting </span>season, i.e., the winter, when it is easy to plow, since the earth has already been turned over at the end of the summer, the field will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>require <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>of plowing in <span class="gemarra-regular">the plowing </span>season, i.e., at the end of the summer, when it is more difficult to plow, since the earth is hard and dry. In that case, he will have to pay his summer plowman two days’ wages for less than two days of work. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">a day’s </span>plowing in the <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing </span>season, the field will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>require a full <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>of plowing in the <span class="gemarra-regular">planting </span>season. In that case, he will have to pay his winter plowman a full day’s wages for less than a full day of work.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say</span> it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a day’s </span>plowing in the <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing </span>season, and the field will still require a full day of plowing in the planting season <span class="gemarra-regular">since he plows</span> once before he sows the seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the plowing after the seeds are sown. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>instead that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day’s </span>plowing in the <span class="gemarra-regular">planting </span>season, and the field will in fact require two full days of plowing in the plowing season if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">rocky ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> on which plowing takes longer.
In connection with this discussion, the Gemara clarifies the conditions under which <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which its joint owners draw their water, is divided. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>It should be divided only if each party will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of </span>water needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">a day’s irrigation </span>work. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">an orchard, Shmuel’s father says: </span>It should be divided only if each party will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>large enough to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one-third of the measure required for a field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: I am selling you part </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a vineyard, </span>without specifying how much of the vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos says: He may not </span>give him <span class="gemarra-regular">less than an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area </span>large enough to plant <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yosei said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">These are nothing other than words of prophecy, </span>i.e., I do not see the logic behind this statement, and it is as if based on prophecy and a heavenly decree, as the seller did not mention any area, but rather spoke in the most general of terms: Part of a vineyard. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the measure with regard to this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia? Rava bar Kisna said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Three rows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atzyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of twelve vines, which is </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">a person can hoe in </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">day.</span>
§ In connection with Rabbi Yosei’s statement that Sumakhos’s words are nothing but words of prophecy, the Gemara reports that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avdimi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Haifa says: From the day that the Temple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was destroyed prophecy was taken from the prophets and given </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the Sages. </span>The Gemara expresses astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage is not </span>fit to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a prophet? </span>Rabbi Avdimi seems to say that these are two distinct categories of people. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>Rabbi Avdimi <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even though </span>prophecy <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taken from the prophets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was not taken from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: And a Sage is greater than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a prophet, as it is stated: “And a prophet has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a heart of wisdom” </span>(Psalms 90:12), i.e., he is wise. When comparisons are drawn, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is compared to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom? You must say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lesser is compared to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the greater. </span>Here too, prophecy is compared to wisdom, thus indicating that wisdom is greater than prophecy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Know </span>that this is so, that the Sages still enjoy the prophetic gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a great man makes a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>with regard to a point of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the same statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">cited in the name of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different great man in accordance with his </span>statement, indicating that the Sages makes their statements by way of prophecy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span> disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: And what is the difficulty </span>with explaining this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps they were born under the same constellation, </span>and since they are similar in their traits, they reach the same conclusions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: Know </span>that this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a great man makes a statement and </span>the same statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">cited</span>

Daf 12b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of </span>the well-known <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yosef in accordance with his </span>statement. It certainly cannot be maintained that the first Sage is similar in his nature to the illustrious Rabbi Akiva, so he must have arrived at his statement through prophecy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty </span>with explaining this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>they were born under <span class="gemarra-regular">the same constellation, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this issue </span>the first Sage has the same understanding as Rabbi Akiva.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi said: Know </span>that this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a great</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man makes a statement and </span>the same statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">cited as a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with his </span>statement. The Sage makes a statement that corresponds to words pronounced in Heaven, which, without prophecy, is beyond human capability. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>he arrived at this idea by chance, without the assistance of prophecy, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a blind man </span>who makes his way <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a skylight. </span>A blind man cannot deliberately find a skylight; therefore, his finding it occurs by chance. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">not offer a reason </span>for his statement? The fact that he demonstrates an understanding of the issue indicates that he does not arrive at his idea by chance, but rather by prophecy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day that the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the prophets and given to imbeciles and children. </span>The Gemara explains: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way was prophecy given <span class="gemarra-regular">to imbeciles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was standing in the street [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beristeka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meḥoza </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he heard a certain imbecile say: The head</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the yeshiva who will be appointed in Mata Meḥasya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> signs </span>his name <span class="gemarra-regular">Tavyumei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Mar bar Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who among the Sages signs </span>his name <span class="gemarra-regular">Tavyumei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Nobody but <span class="gemarra-regular">me. Conclude from </span>the statement by the imbecile <span class="gemarra-regular">that my hour has arrived, </span>and I will reap success in this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">He arose and went </span>to Mata Meḥasya. <span class="gemarra-regular">By the time he arrived, the Sages </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">decided to appoint Rav Aḥa of Dift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the head</span> of the yeshiva.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As soon as</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that </span>Mar bar Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">had arrived</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they determined not to proceed with their appointment without the approval of an important figure such as him. <span class="gemarra-regular">They sent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pair of Sages to him to consult with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he detained them. They again sent a pair of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages </span>to him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he detained them </span>as well. This continued <span class="gemarra-regular">until they completed </span>a quorum <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten </span>Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they reached ten </span>men, Mar bar Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>his lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught, and expounded. </span>He did not speak earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">because one should not open a lecture during </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the gatherings for Torah study during the months of Elul and Adar, when <span class="gemarra-regular">less than ten </span>men are present. He was then appointed as head of the yeshiva.
Understanding that he had been passed over for the position, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa </span>of Difti <span class="gemarra-regular">read about himself </span>the rabbinic aphorism: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who is treated poorly will not soon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be treated well; and anyone who is treated well will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not soon be treated poorly. </span>Rav Aḥa understood that he had lost the chance to be appointed, whereas Mar bar Rav Ashi had the good fortune to be appointed, and would remain in his position.
And in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way was prophecy given <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>incident involving the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥisda, </span>who when she was a child <span class="gemarra-regular">was sitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on her father’s lap </span>while he sat and learned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava and Rami bar Ḥama were sitting before him. </span>Rav Ḥisda jokingly <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>his daughter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which of them would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you want </span>as a husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said: </span>I want <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them. Rava said: And I </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">last. </span>And this is what happened; first she married Rami bar Ḥama, and when he died she married Rava.
Having already cited one statement of Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa, the Gemara cites another statement in his name: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avdimi from Haifa says: Before a person eats and drinks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has two hearts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning his heart is unsettled because he is distracted by hunger. But <span class="gemarra-regular">after he eats</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and drinks he has only one heart, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “A hollow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nevuv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] man is two-hearted” </span>(Job 11:12). How is it indicated that “<span class="it-text">nevuv</span>” means hungry? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written </span>concerning the altar: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nevuv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">luḥot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 27:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">which we translate </span>into Aramaic as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hollow with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">planks, </span>meaning that a hollow person, i.e., one who has not yet eaten, is two-hearted.
The Gemara continues to discuss the meaning of <span class="it-text">nevuv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is accustomed to wine, although his heart, </span>i.e., his mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">is closed like a virgin, wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opens it, as it is stated: “And new wine opens</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yenovev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the virgins” </span>(Zechariah 9:17). The word <span class="it-text">yenovev</span> is used here in the sense of clearing out a space: Even if one’s heart and mind are closed, wine will open them to understanding.
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the division of property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span> that if a person inherits <span class="gemarra-regular">a portion </span>of his father’s estate because he is the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, and </span>he also inherits <span class="gemarra-regular">a portion </span>of that estate as <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>son, like the rest of his brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is given</span> his two portions <span class="gemarra-regular">along one boundary, </span>so that they are adjacent to one another and form a single property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a man whose brother died without children, who is obligated by Torah law to marry his deceased brother’s widow or grant her <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>? If he marries his brother’s widow, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> dictates that he receive his brother’s portion of their father’s estate in addition to his own. Does he too receive the two portions along one boundary?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> case. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One calls </span>the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">“firstborn” </span>(see <span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> 24a) and therefore he is treated like a firstborn in all regards. He receives the two portions of his father’s estate as a single parcel of land. But <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And it shall be, the firstborn” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:6). With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his being, </span>i.e., his inheritance itself, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is like a firstborn; but </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the distribution</span> of the estate, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not like a firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the brothers are not obligated to give him two adjacent portions.
It is reported that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain person bought land along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the boundary of his father’s property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> After some time the father died. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they </span>came to <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the estate, this person <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>his brothers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion </span>of the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">along my boundary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">compels </span>people to refrain from <span class="gemarra-regular">conduct </span>characteristic <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sodom. </span>The court forces a person to waive his legal rights in order to prevent him from acting in a manner characteristic of the wicked city of Sodom. Since it makes no difference to the brothers which portion they receive since the parcels of land must be of equal value, whereas it matters to this brother that the area he receives should be adjacent to the land he already bought, the court forces the others to give this brother his portion along his boundary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef objects to this, </span>saying this is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom, since the brothers can explain their refusal to grant the request. <span class="gemarra-regular">The brothers </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: We assess this </span>field that you want for yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">valuable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like the property of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house of bar Maryon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The brothers can claim that the portion he wants is more desirable than the others, and for that reason they do not want to give it to him. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, </span>and the brothers can refuse the request.
If a father leaves his two sons <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>parcels of <span class="gemarra-regular">land next to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">channels [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nigrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and one brother requests the field that is next to a field that he already owns, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">compels </span>people to refrain from <span class="gemarra-regular">conduct </span>characteristic <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sodom</span> and allows that brother to receive the field adjoining his own. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef objects to this, </span>saying that if the other brother protests and wants that parcel of land, it is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom because he may have a valid reason for objecting: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes this</span> water channel <span class="gemarra-regular">continues running </span>well, <span class="gemarra-regular">while this </span>second one <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not continue running </span>well; therefore, the second brother wants to receive land that adjoins a water channel on both sides. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef.</span>
If a father leaves his two sons <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>parcels of land <span class="gemarra-regular">next to one channe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and one of the brothers already owns a field next to one of those parcels of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">compels </span>people to refrain from <span class="gemarra-regular">conduct </span>characteristic <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sodom </span>and allows that brother to receive the field adjoining his own. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this, </span>saying that this is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom because the other brother <span class="gemarra-regular">can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I want </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">sharecroppers to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> increase. </span>If my field is in the middle and you have fields on either side, you will need more sharecroppers to work them and my field will enjoy greater security. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">the increase </span>of sharecroppers <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing, </span>and this is therefore not a valid reason for objecting. 

Daf 13a

If there is a water <span class="gemarra-regular">channel </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">one sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a river </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the other side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divided diagonally [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekarna</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">zol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> between the two brothers, so that they each receive land adjoining both the river and the water channel.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a hall, </span>a drawing room, and the like should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be divided unless the two parties will be able to use their respective portions in the same manner that they had previously used them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not enough</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for this one and that one? </span>What is to be done if one of the parties wishes to dissolve the partnership? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: There is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> a price. That is to say, one party can say to the other: Set a price you are willing to pay for my share, and I will sell my share to you or purchase your share from you at that price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: There is no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will set </span>a price; rather, the partnership continues.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to you who say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will set </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">what should they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do </span>if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn </span>son <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary</span> brother <span class="gemarra-regular">whose father left them a slave and a non</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-kosher animal </span>as an inheritance? How are they to be divided? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I say that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> work for this one, </span>the ordinary brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the other one, </span>the firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">two days.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Yehuda’s approach from what is taught in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 41a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who is half-slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half-freeman, </span>e.g., a slave who had been jointly owned by two people, one of whom emancipated him, <span class="gemarra-regular">serves his master one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day and himself one day; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say: You have remedied </span>the situation of <span class="gemarra-regular">his master, </span>who benefits fully from all his rights to the slave, but <span class="gemarra-regular">you have not remedied his own </span>situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">He cannot marry a maidservant, </span>since half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <span class="gemarra-regular">He is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not able to marry a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">free woman, </span>since half of him is a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <span class="gemarra-regular">he should be idle </span>and not marry, <span class="gemarra-regular">but is it not </span>true that <span class="gemarra-regular">the world was created </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">create it to be a waste; He formed it to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be inhabited” </span>(Isaiah 45:18)?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">forces</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his maste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to make him a freeman </span>by emancipating the half that he owns, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bill </span>in which the slave accepts responsibility to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his value </span>to his master. This was the original version of the mishna. The ultimate version of the mishna records the retraction of Beit Hillel: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel retracted </span>its opinion and <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled in accordance with the statement of Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai. </span>This indicates that it is only in this case, where there is the particular consideration of procreation, that the court compels one of the parties to forfeit his portion and dissolve the partnership. But in other cases there is no <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: Either you set a price or I will set a price.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> a price, but he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>able to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">You set </span>a price. In other words, the slave cannot offer to sell himself, because his Jewish side precludes him from selling himself as a Canaanite slave. Therefore, the court would not be able force the master to sell his share, were it not for the consideration of procreation. By contrast, in a situation where either side can buy or sell, one partner can compel the other to either buy his portion or sell his portion to him.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what is taught in a mishna (172a): In a case where there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers, one poo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one rich, and their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father left them a bathhouse or an olive press </span>as an inheritance, if the father had <span class="gemarra-regular">built </span>these facilities <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">profit, </span>i.e., to charge others for using them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> profit </span>that accrues after the father’s death is <span class="gemarra-regular">shared</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equally </span>by the two brothers. If the father had <span class="gemarra-regular">built</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them for himself </span>and for the members of his household to use, the poor brother, who has little use for these amenities, cannot force the rich brother to convert the facilities to commercial use; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the rich </span>brother can <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the poor </span>brother: 

Daf 13b

Go <span class="gemarra-regular">take servants </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for yourself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they will bathe in the bathhouse.</span> Or he can say: Go <span class="gemarra-regular">take olives for yourself and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come and transform </span>them into oil <span class="gemarra-regular">in the olive press</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Evidently, the poor brother cannot say to him: Buy my share. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">There too </span>the poor brother can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">You set </span>a price and buy my share, as the rich brother has the means to buy his poor brother’s portion; but he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>able to say: Or else <span class="gemarra-regular">I will set </span>a price and buy your share, as the poor brother does not have the money to buy his brother out.
The Gemara further proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything which, </span>even after it <span class="gemarra-regular">is divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> each of the parts <span class="gemarra-regular">retains the name </span>of the original item, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be divided. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the parts will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>retain the original name, the item should not be divided, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">its monetary </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">is assessed, </span>because one of the joint owners can say to the other: Either you set a price and buy it from me, or I will set a price and buy it from you. The Gemara explains: Actually, this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a courtyard or the like was not large enough to warrant division into two, and one of the co-owners said to the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">You take </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of the courtyard, e.g., four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I </span>will take <span class="gemarra-regular">less</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">listens to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not listen to him.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumstances </span>of the case under discussion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught, what is Rabban Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gamliel’s reasoning? </span>Why does he rule that the court ignores the party who is prepared to settle for less? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If one of the co-owners said to the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">You take </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I </span>will take <span class="gemarra-regular">less, </span>all agree that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">listens to him. </span>And the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if one says: Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price and buy it from me, <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will set </span>a price and buy it from you, <span class="gemarra-regular">they also listen to him. And Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel comes to say: </span>In the first case the court does listen to him, but <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not listen to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>when he says: Either you set a price or I will set a price. Accordingly, this issue is the subject of a tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>be understood exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught. And with regard to what you said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s reasoning? </span>Why can’t one of the parties say that they should divide the property and he will settle for less? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the second one <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: If </span>you want me to compensate you with <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>for the difference between my share and your share, <span class="gemarra-regular">I have no money </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to give you. </span>And if you wish to give it to me as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, I am not at ease </span>with that, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “But he who hates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gifts shall live” </span>(Proverbs 15:27). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that there is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: Either you set a price or I will set a price, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yehuda.
As a continuation of this discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: That</span> statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda is </span>actually the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings, </span>i.e., a scroll of any of the twenty-four books of the Bible, that were inherited by two people, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divide </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if both of them wish </span>to do so, because it would be a show of disrespect to cut the scroll in half. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: They taught</span> that sacred writings should not be divided <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if they are contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in one scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>when they are contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in two scrolls, they may be divided. And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it should enter your mind </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of: </span>Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will set </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apply <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically to one scroll? Even </span>if the sacred writings were contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in two scrolls, </span>they should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not divide them, since the respective parts will not be even and one of the recipients will have to compensate the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shalman interpreted </span>the mishna: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they both want </span>to divide the sacred writings; therefore, Shmuel said that they may do so when they are contained in two scrolls. But if just one of them wishes to divide them, there is no proof that he can compel the other one to accept the division.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yehuda that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of: </span>Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">set </span>a price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman, </span>who disagrees with Rav Yehuda and says that there is no such <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: I do not know </span>of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is to say, I do not maintain </span>this opinion. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it happened that <span class="gemarra-regular">the father of Ravin bar Ḥinnana and Rav Dimi bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥinnana </span>died and <span class="gemarra-regular">left them two maidservants, one </span>of whom <span class="gemarra-regular">knew how to bake and to cook, and the other </span>of whom <span class="gemarra-regular">knew how to spin and to weave. </span>One of the brothers suggested that each of them take one of the maidservants entirely for himself and forfeit his rights to the other maidservant. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rava and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: There is no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of: </span>Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will set </span>a price.
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">different there, since this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">master wanted both of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the other master wanted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both of them. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>one of the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">You take one and I </span>will take the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not </span>a case of: Either <span class="gemarra-regular">you set </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will set </span>a price. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And can we not say so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But </span>there is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings, which both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">want, and Shmuel said: They taught </span>that sacred writings should not be divided <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if they are contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in one scroll; but </span>when they are contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two scrolls, they may be divided. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shalman interpreted </span>the mishna: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">want </span>to divide the sacred writings, and in such a case they may divide them, provided that they are in two scrolls.
§ The Gemara now begins a general discussion about sacred writings. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: A person may attach the Torah, the Prophets, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Writings togethe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as one </span>scroll; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: The Torah </span>should be a scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the books of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Prophets</span> a scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">by themselves, and </span>the books of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Writings</span> a scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">by themselves. And the Sages say: Each one</span> of the books of the Prophets and the Writings should be a scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving Baitos ben Zunin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eight </span>books <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Prophets attached together as one </span>scroll, and he did this <span class="gemarra-regular">with the approval of Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Azarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And others say that each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>of the books was a scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>in accordance with the opinion of the Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where they brought before us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings attached together as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">and we </span>ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir and <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed them fit.</span>
The Gemara states: When different books are included in the same scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>empty <span class="gemarra-regular">lines </span>of space should be left <span class="gemarra-regular">between each book of the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and similarly between one </span>book of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Prophets and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another. But </span>between each of the books of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Twelve Prophets </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>empty <span class="gemarra-regular">lines </span>should be left, because they are considered one book. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">finish </span>a book <span class="gemarra-regular">at the botto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> of one column <span class="gemarra-regular">and begin</span> the next book <span class="gemarra-regular">at the top </span>of the next column without leaving any empty space in between.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who wishes to attach the Torah, the Prophets, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the Writings together as one </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">may attach </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">He should leave enough </span>empty parchment <span class="gemarra-regular">at the beginning </span>of the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">for winding around the pole </span>to which the beginning of the scroll is fastened. <span class="gemarra-regular">And at the end</span> of the scroll he should leave enough empty parchment <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> winding around the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">circumferenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the rolled-up scroll. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may finish </span>a book <span class="gemarra-regular">at the bottom </span>of one column <span class="gemarra-regular">and begin </span>the next book <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top </span>of the next column without leaving any empty space between them. 

Daf 14a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he wishes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may cut </span>it. The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? </span>Why is mention made here of cutting the scroll? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>He arranges the text so that if he finishes a book at the bottom of one column, he begins the next book at the top of the next column without leaving any empty space, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that if he wishes to cut </span>the scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may cut </span>it. If he does not begin the next book at the top of the next column, he will not be able to cut the scroll, because it is not fitting for a scroll to begin with an empty space.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Enough </span>parchment should be left at <span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning of the scroll and at its en</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for winding. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">For winding </span>around <span class="gemarra-regular">what? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">for winding around the pole </span>to which the beginning of the scroll is fastened, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span> in light of what is taught in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that at the end of the scroll enough parchment should be left for winding around the entire <span class="gemarra-regular">circumference </span>of the scroll. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">for winding around </span>the entire <span class="gemarra-regular">circumference, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>in light of what is taught in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that at the beginning of the scroll enough parchment should be left for winding around the <span class="gemarra-regular">pole.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disjunctively, </span>referring to two separate cases. He issues a general statement requiring that enough parchment be left for winding as needed: At the beginning of the pole, enough to wind around the pole, and at the end of the scroll, enough to wind around the circumference.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: When that</span> second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>indicating that the same measure of parchment is left at both the beginning and the end of the scroll, it was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Torah scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">scrolls</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are wound from the beginning to the en</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> around a single pole, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a Torah scroll is wound </span>from both ends <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> around two <span class="gemarra-regular">poles, </span>one of which <span class="gemarra-regular">he attaches at this </span>end of the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">at the other </span>end. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Tzadok, said: This is how the scribes in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem made their scrolls, </span>i.e., with poles at either end so that it could be rolled to the middle.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah scroll should not be made </span>in such a manner <span class="gemarra-regular">that its length, </span>i.e., its height, <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its circumferenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> when it is rolled up; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">its circumference be greater than its length. They asked Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">What should the size of a Torah scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be? </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>If it was written <span class="gemarra-regular">on a hide that was treated with gallnuts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">evil </span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>handbreadths long. They asked him further: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>should it be if it was written <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">parchment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelaf </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know.</span>
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna wrote seventy Torah scrolls </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happened for him </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>that the length and the circumference were equal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov wrote one</span> Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">on calf hide and it happened </span>to have the same length and circumference. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages looked at him</span> and his achievement with jealousy, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he died </span>from their envious gaze.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to Rav Hamnuna: Rabbi Ami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wrote four hundred Torah scrolls. </span>Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Perhaps he wrote </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Moses commanded us the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:4) four hundred times, rather than four hundred complete Torah scrolls, as it is difficult to say that he could have written so many, even over a lifetime. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabbi Zeira: Rabbi Yannai planted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four hundred vineyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perhaps </span>he did not plant large vineyards, but only the smallest possible vineyards recognized by <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, which are composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>vines <span class="gemarra-regular">facing </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>vines, with a fifth <span class="gemarra-regular">one protruding </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail, </span>extending out beyond the square.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to what is taught with regard to the length of a Torah scroll from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark </span>of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">that Moses fashioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its length was two and one-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">half cubits, its width was one and one-half cubits, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and its height was one and one-half cubits </span>(see Exodus 25:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit </span>used for these measurements <span class="gemarra-regular">being six</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths. </span>Therefore, the Ark was fifteen handbreadths long, nine handbreadths wide, and nine handbreadths high.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets, their length was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> width was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their thickness was three </span>handbreadths. The tablets <span class="gemarra-regular">were placed along the length of the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one next to the other. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>space did <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets occupy </span>along the length <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ark? Twelve handbreadths, </span>as each tablet was six handbreadths long. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three handbreadths were left there </span>along the length of the Ark, for a total of fifteen handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Deduct a handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from them: One-half </span>a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">for this wall, </span>namely, the thickness of the wooden Ark itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">for the other wall. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadths were left there, in which the Torah scroll </span>written by Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">lay.</span>
What biblical source indicates that a Torah scroll was placed there? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “There </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stone which Moses put there” </span>(I Kings 8:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">“there was nothing in the Ark except” </span>mean? This is an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a restriction following a restriction, </span>as both terms, “nothing” and “except,” indicate that the Ark was empty. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is a hermeneutical principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a restriction </span><span class="gemarra-regular">following a restriction serv</span>es <span class="gemarra-regular">only to amplify </span>and include other matters. In this case, it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scroll that lies in the Ark.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: With this explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">you have accounted for the</span> entire <span class="gemarra-regular">length of the Ark; go </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">and account for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the width of the Ark, </span>which was nine handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>space did <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets occupy </span>of the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Ark, </span>which was nine handbreadths wide? <span class="gemarra-regular">Six handbreadths; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths were left there </span>along the width of the Ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">Deduct a handbreadth from them: One-half </span>a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">this wall and one-half</span> a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other wall. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths were left there. </span>What was their purpose? These were necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the Torah scroll would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">able to go in and out without being pressed; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>used for all the measurements of the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">was five handbreadths</span> long. There-fore, the Ark was twelve and one-half handbreadths long, seven and one-half handbreadths wide, and seven and one-half handbreadths high. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets, their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> length was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">their width was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their thickness was three </span>handbreadths, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they were placed along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the length of the Ark, </span>one next to the other. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>space did <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets occupy </span>along the length <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Ark? Twelve handbreadths, </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half a handbreadth was left there, </span>which is two fingerbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">One fingerbreadth </span>of those two was <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">this wall and one fingerbreadth </span>of those two was <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other wall.</span>
With this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have accounted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">length of the Ark; go </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">account for the width of the Ark, </span>which was seven and one-half handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>space did <span class="gemarra-regular">the tablets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">occupy in the Ark? Six handbreadths, </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">one and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one-half handbreadths were left there </span>along the width of the Ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">Deduct one-half a handbreadth, one and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-half fingerbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">this wall, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and one-half fingerbreadths for </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other wall. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth was left there in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>silver <span class="gemarra-regular">column</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were placed </span>on either side of the tablets, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “King Solomon made himself a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> palanquin of the timbers of Lebanon; he made its columns</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Song of Songs 3:9–10). This is understood as an allusion to the Ark of the Covenant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the chest in which the Philistines sent the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gift to the God of Israel was placed alongside </span>the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And put the golden devices </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which you are restoring to Him for a guilt-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a chest by the side of it, and send </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it away that it may go” </span>(I Samuel 6:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon </span>this chest <span class="gemarra-regular">lay the Torah scroll, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 31:26). This means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was placed at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the side </span>of the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not inside </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">how do I realize </span>the meaning of that which is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There was nothing in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark except </span>the two tablets of stone which Moses put there,” which, according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, teaches that something else was in the Ark besides the tablets themselves?

Daf 14b

<span class="gemarra-regular">the broken pieces of the</span> first set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets, which were placed in the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Having cited the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara now presents its objection to what was taught earlier with regard to the dimensions of a Torah scroll: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it should enter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your mind </span>to say, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi held, that <span class="gemarra-regular">the circumference of a Torah scroll is six handbreadths, now </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since any </span>cylindrical object <span class="gemarra-regular">having a circumference of three handbreadths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has a diameter of one handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a Torah scroll with a circumference of six handbreadths has a diameter of two handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>a Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is wound to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the middle, </span>since it is rolled from both sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>must take up <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two handbreadths </span>due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">space between </span>the sheets of parchment and the double rolling. According to Rabbi Meir, who says that the Torah scroll was placed inside the ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">how did </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pushkei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of space in the Ark?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: The scroll of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>which was kept in the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">was wound to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its beginning, </span>i.e., it had only a single pole, so that its circumference was only two handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But still, how does </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is two </span>handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">fit into </span>a space that is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>handbreadths? It would be impossible to fit it in. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi said: A small section </span>of the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">was wound</span> separately <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">placed on top </span>of the scroll.
Having concluded its current discussion, the Gemara now addresses the details of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who says that the Torah scroll rested on the chest that came from the Philistines, <span class="gemarra-regular">where was the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah scroll placed before the chest arrived? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A shelf protruded from </span>the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Torah scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rested on it. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir, </span>who says that the Torah scroll rested inside the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he do with this </span>verse: “Take this Torah scroll and put it <span class="gemarra-regular">at the side of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark” </span>(Deuteronomy 31:26)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires </span>that verse to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">was placed at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the side </span>of the tablets, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that it was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed between </span>the two <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets, but </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">at the side </span>of the tablets.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where were the </span>silver <span class="gemarra-regular">columns placed? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Outside </span>the Ark. The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">the broken pieces of the </span>first set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets were placed in the Ark, </span>as the verse from which Rabbi Yehuda learns this: “There was nothing in the Ark except” (I Kings 8:9), is needed by Rabbi Meir to teach that the Torah scroll was placed there? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>this point <span class="gemarra-regular">from what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna </span>expounded, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Huna says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“The Ark of God, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereupon is called the Name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord of hosts that sits upon the cherubs” </span>(II Samuel 6:2)? The phrase “the name, the name of the Lord” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets and the broken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pieces of the </span>first set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets were placed in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Ark.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>Sage, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, derive from this verse? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires </span>that text <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the </span>ineffable <span class="gemarra-regular">name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">and all of His appellations were placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Ark.</span>
The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>Sage, Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">also require it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is indeed so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rather, from where does he </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">the broken pieces</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>first set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets were placed in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark? </span>The Gemara expounds: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef taught, as Rav Yosef taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verses state: “At that time the Lord said to me: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first…and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <span class="gemarra-regular">which you broke, and you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall put the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in the Ark” (Deuteronomy 10:1–2). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>second set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">broken pieces of the </span>first set of <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets were placed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Ark.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>one, Rabbi Yehuda, learn from this verse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Reish Lakish </span>teaches, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Reish Lakish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>What is the meaning of that which is stated: “The first tablets, <span class="gemarra-regular">which you broke [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asher</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shibbarta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? </span>These words allude to the fact that God approved of Moses’ action, as if <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moses: May your strength be straight </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yishar</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">koḥakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] because you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> broke </span>them.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: The order of the </span>books of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Prophet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> when they are attached together is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua and Judges, Samuel and Kings, Jeremiah and Ezekiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaiah and the Twelve </span>Prophets. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Consider: Hosea preceded </span>some of the other prophets whose books are included in the Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord spoke first to Hosea” </span>(Hosea 1:2). At first glance this verse is difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did God speak first with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hosea, </span>and not with any other prophet before him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Weren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t there many prophets between Moses and Hosea? And Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan says: He was the first of four prophets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who prophesied in that period, and they were: Hosea and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Isaiah, Amos and Micah. </span>Accordingly, Hosea preceded those three prophets; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hosea </span>as well <span class="gemarra-regular">should precede </span>the books of those prophets.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since his prophecy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written together with </span>those of <span class="gemarra-regular">Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi </span>in one book of the Twelve Prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Haggai, Zechariah, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Malachi were the last of the prophets, he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counted with them. </span>The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>the book of Hosea <span class="gemarra-regular">be written separately and let it precede </span>the others. The Gemara answers: Were it written separately, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is small it would be lost.</span>
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Consider: Isaiah preceded Jeremiah and Ezekiel; let </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaiah precede </span>the books of those other prophets. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Kings ends with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the destruction </span>of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah </span>deals <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely with </span>prophecies of <span class="gemarra-regular">the destruction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ezekiel begins with the destruction </span>of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">but ends with consolation </span>and the rebuilding of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Isaiah </span>deals <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely with consolation, </span>as most of his prophecies refer to the redemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">we juxtapose destruction to destruction </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and consolation to consolation. </span>This accounts for the order: Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Writing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ruth and the book of Psalms</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Job and Proverbs; Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and Lamentations</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; Daniel and the Scroll of Esther; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Ezra and Chronicles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the time of Moses, let </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job precede </span>the others. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not begin with suffering, </span>i.e., it is inappropriate to start the Writings with a book that deals so extensively with suffering. The Gemara asks: But the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ruth, </span>with which the Writings opens, <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">suffering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since it describes the tragedies that befell the family of Elimelech. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">suffering which has a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> futur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of hope and redemption. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Why was she named Ruth, </span>spelled <span class="it-text">reish</span>, <span class="it-text">vav</span>, <span class="it-text">tav</span>? Because there <span class="gemarra-regular">descended from her David who sated, </span>a word with the root <span class="it-text">reish</span>, <span class="it-text">vav</span>, <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be He, with songs and praises.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> now considers the authors of the biblical books: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who wrote </span>the books of the Bible? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses wrote his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own book, </span>i.e., the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the portion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Balaa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah, </span>which describe the death of Moses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Samuel wrote his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own book, </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judges, and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ruth. David wrote the book of Psalms by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of previous generations, assembling a collection that included compositions of others along with his own. He included psalms authored <span class="gemarra-regular">by Adam the first </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">by Melchizedek </span>king of Salem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and by Abraham, and by Moses, and by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Heman, and by Jeduthun, and by Asaph, </span>

Daf 15a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by the three sons of Korah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrote his own book, and the book of Kings, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lamentations. Hezekiah and his colleague</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wrote </span>the following, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mnemonic </span>to remember which books they wrote is <span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Isaiah [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yeshaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], Proverbs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Mishlei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], Song of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Songs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">HaShirim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and Ecclesiastes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kohelet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. The members of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Great Assembly wrote </span>the following, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>to remember these books is <span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dalet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Ezekiel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yeḥezkel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and the Twelve Prophets [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sheneim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Asar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Daniel </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">Daniel </span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Scroll of Esther [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Megillat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Ester</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. Ezra wrote </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own book and the genealogy of </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Chronicles until his </span>period.
The Gemara comments: This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports Rav, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Ezra did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascend from Babylonia </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">until he established his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own genealogy, and </span>after that he <span class="gemarra-regular">ascended. </span>This genealogy is what is written in the book of Chronicles. <span class="gemarra-regular">And who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">completed </span>the book of Chronicles for the generations following Ezra? <span class="gemarra-regular">Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah.</span>
The Gemara elaborates on the particulars of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master said </span>above that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua wrote his own book and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eight verses of the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara comments: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught in accordance with the one who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote the </span>last <span class="gemarra-regular">eight verses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah. </span>This point is subject to a tannaitic dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the servant of the Lord died there” </span>(Deuteronomy 34:5); <span class="gemarra-regular">is it possible that </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses died, he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote </span>the entire Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">until this point, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua wrote from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya </span>stated this opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon said to him: Is it possible </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Take this Torah scroll” </span>(Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, until this point the Holy One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated </span>after Him <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wrot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the text. <span class="gemarra-regular">From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>with respect to Moses’ death, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Moses wrote with tears. </span>The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <span class="gemarra-regular">later, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>concerning the writing of the Prophets: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me, and I wrote them with ink in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scroll” </span>(Jeremiah 36:18).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which Rabbi Yehoshua </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>When the Torah is read publicly in the synagogue, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">read</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>last <span class="gemarra-regular">eight verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Torah, </span>and that section may not be divided between two readers? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>as according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are an integral part of the Torah, written by Moses just like the rest? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that this was said in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, since they differ </span>from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them with tears, <span class="gemarra-regular">they differ </span>from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, i.e., they may not be divided between two readers.
It is stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua wrote his own book. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written </span>toward the end of the book: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, died” </span>(Joshua 24:29)? Is it possible that Joshua wrote this? The Gemara answers: Aaron’s son <span class="gemarra-regular">Eleazar completed it. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eleazar, son of Aaron, died” </span>(Joshua 24:33)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas completed it.</span>
It is also stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Samuel wrote his own book. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: “And Samuel died” </span>(I Samuel 28:3)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gad the seer and Nathan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the prophet finished it.</span>
It is further stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">David wrote the book of Psalms by means </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of ten elders, </span>whom the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> proceeds to list. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let it also count Ethan the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ezrahite </span>among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is </span>the same person as <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham. </span>Proof for this is the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written here: </span>“A Maskil of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ethan the Ezrahite” </span>(Psalms 89:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there: “Who raised up one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the east [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mizraḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], whom righteousness </span>met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse.
The Gemara asks: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">counts Moses </span>among the ten elders whose works are included in the book of Psalms, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">counts Heman. But doesn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Heman </span>mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same person as <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses? </span>This is proven by the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written here: “Heman” </span>(Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>about Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For he is the trusted one in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all My house” </span>(Numbers 12:7). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were two Hemans, </span>one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses wrote </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own book, </span>i.e., the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Balaam, and </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job. This supports Rabbi Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Laḥma, as Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma says: Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the time of Moses. It is written here </span>with regard to Job: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Oh, that my words were written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Job 19:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there </span>in Moses’ words to God: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For in what shall it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be known here [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 33:16). The unusual use of the word <span class="it-text">eifo</span> in these two places indicates that Job and Moses lived in the same generation.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that Job lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time of Isaac, as it is written </span>in connection with Isaac: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who then [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is he that has taken </span><span class="gemarra-regular">venison” </span>(Genesis 27:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">Or say </span>that he lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time of Jacob, as it is written </span>with respect to Jacob: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If it must be so now [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this” </span>(Genesis 43:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Or say </span>that he lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time of Joseph, as it is written </span>with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <span class="gemarra-regular">where [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are they feeding their flocks?” </span>(Genesis 37:16).
The Gemara answers: It could <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind </span>to say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written </span>in the continuation of the previously mentioned verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Oh, that </span>my words <span class="gemarra-regular">were inscribed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veyuḥaku</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a book” </span>(Job 19:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is Moses who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> called the inscriber, as it is written </span>with regard to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he provided the first part for himself, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for there was the inscriber’s [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥokek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] portion reserved” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:21).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Job</span> lived <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the spies </span>whom Moses sent to scout the land of Canaan. This is proven by the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written here: “There was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man in the land of Utz, whose name was Job</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Job 1:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there </span>in the account of the spies: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whether there are trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it” </span>(Numbers 13:20). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it comparable? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>the word that is used is <span class="gemarra-italic">Utz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span> the word is <span class="gemarra-italic">eitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what Moses said to Israel, </span>i.e., to the spies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that man </span>named Job still alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">he whose years </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are as long as </span>the years <span class="gemarra-regular">of a tree and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who protects his generation like a tree? </span>This is why the allusion to him here is through the word <span class="it-text">eitz</span>, rather than <span class="it-text">Utz</span>.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the Sages sat before Rabbi Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Naḥmani and he sat and said: Job never existed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and was never created; </span>there was never such a person as Job. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>his story <span class="gemarra-regular">was a parable. </span>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In rebuttal <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “There was a man in the Land of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Utz whose name was Job” </span>(Job 1:1), which indicates that such a man did indeed exist.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>that the words “there was” prove that Job existed, what shall we say about the parable that Natan the prophet presented to David: “There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the poor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man had nothing except one little lamb, which he had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bought and reared” </span>(II Samuel 12:3)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Was there </span>really such a person? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it was merely a parable; here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too it is merely a parable. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>that it is a parable, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">his name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the name of his city? </span>Rather, Job was clearly a real person.
The Gemara cites another opinion with regard to the time when Job lived. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar both say: Job was among those who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascended from the exile </span>to Eretz Yisrael at the start of the Second Temple period, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his house of study </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was in Tiberias. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from what is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The days of Job’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">life </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">from when Israel entered Egypt until they left, </span>indicating that this is the period during which he lived and not, as suggested, in the early days of the Second Temple. 

Daf 15b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that the duration of Job’s life lasted as long <span class="gemarra-regular">as from when Israel entered Egypt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until when they left, </span>but not that he lived during that specific time frame.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> against the notion that Job was a Jew: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven prophets</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prophesied to the nations of the world, and they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Balaam and his fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> Beor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Job, Eliphaz the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elihu ben Barachel the Buzite, </span>which indicates that Job was not Jewish. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: And according to your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>that Job could not have been Jewish because he prophesied to the nations of the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">was Elihu ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Barachel not a Jew? Is it </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">family of Ram” </span>(Job 32:2), meaning Abraham?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must explain that Elihu is included in this list because <span class="gemarra-regular">he prophesied to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nations of the world; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>it may be maintained that <span class="gemarra-regular">Job </span>is included in this list, even though he is Jewish, because he <span class="gemarra-regular">prophesied to the nations of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the world. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did not all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">prophets </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prophesy to the nations of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world? </span>Why then are only these seven mentioned? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to the other prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">their main </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prophecies were </span>directed <span class="gemarra-regular">to Israel, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to these seven prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">their main prophecies were </span>directed <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nations of the world.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from what is taught in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was a </span>certain <span class="gemarra-regular">pious man among the nations of the world and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his name was Job, and he came into the world </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only to receive his reward. The Holy One, Blessed be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He, brought afflictions upon him, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he began to blaspheme </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and curse. The Holy One, Blessed be He, doubled his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reward in this world in order to expel him from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the World-to-Come. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that Job was not a Jew, but rather a gentile.
The Gemara responds: The matter of whether or not Job was Jewish <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the period during which Job lived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> judging of the Judges, as it is stated </span>in connection with Job: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Behold, all you yourselves have seen it; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why then have you become altogether vain?” </span>(Job 27:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">Which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> generation was completely vain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You must say it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the generation of the judging of the Judges, </span>when the people judged the Judges, as will be explained shortly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of Ahasuerus, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “And in all the world were no women found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so beautiful as the daughters of Job” </span>(Job 42:15). In <span class="gemarra-regular">which generation were beautiful women sought? You must say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was the generation of Ahasuerus </span>(Esther, chapter 2). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days of David, as it is written: “And they sought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a beautiful maiden” </span>(I Kings 1:3)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the time of David, they searched <span class="gemarra-regular">“throughout the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> territory of Israel” </span>(I Kings 1:3), whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ahasuerus, </span>they searched <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the world, </span>as is similarly stated with regard to Job’s daughters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kingdom of Sheba, as it is stated: “And Sheba fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon them, and took them away” </span>(Job 1:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of </span>the kingdom of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chaldeans </span>in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “The Chaldeans formed three bands” </span>(Job 1:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Job </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jacob and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he married Dina, the daughter of Jacob</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written here: “You speak as one of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the loathsome women speaks” </span>(Job 2:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written there </span>in the account of the incident involving Dina: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He has done a loathsome act in Israel” </span>(Genesis 34:7). This concludes the text of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And all </span>these <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold that Job </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was a Jew except for </span>the opinion introduced with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say, </span>according to which Job lived in the time of Jacob, and he was certainly not one of Jacob’s sons.
And what is the proof that all these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> maintain that Job was Jewish? <span class="gemarra-regular">As if it should enter your mind </span>to say that he came <span class="gemarra-regular">from the nations of the world, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">After Moses died, did the Divine Presence rest</span> any longer <span class="gemarra-regular">on the nations of the world? But doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t the Master say: Moses requested that the Divine Presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not rest </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">on the nations of the world, and</span> his request <span class="gemarra-regular">was granted to him, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “That we shall be differentiated, I and Your people, </span>from all the people that are upon the face of the earth” (Exodus 33:16), and it is stated there that God acceded to his request.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan says: The generation of Job was awash in licentiousness, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Behold, all of you yourselves have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥazitem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] it; why then have you become altogether vain?” </span>(Job 27:12), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “Return, return, O Shulamite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; return, return, that we may look [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veneḥeze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] upon you” </span>(Song of Songs 7:1), which teaches that the phrase “you have seen it” connotes a licentious gaze. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the phrase “you yourselves have seen it” signifies <span class="gemarra-regular">prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥazon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Isaiah ben Amoz” </span>(Isaiah 1:1). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, why do I </span>need the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Why then have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you become altogether vain”? </span>Rather, the reference must be to inappropriate licentious gazing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>further, with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the generation of the judging of the Judges was one of vanity, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">happened in the days of the judging of the Judges” </span>(Ruth 1:1)? This indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">a generation that judged its judges</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If a judge would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the defendant standing before him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Remove the splinter from between your eyes, </span>meaning rid yourself of some minor infraction, the defendant would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Remove the beam from between your eyes, </span>meaning you have committed far more severe sins. If the judge would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: “Your silver is become dross” </span>(Isaiah 1:22), meaning your coins are counterfeit, the defendant would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: “Your wine is mixed with water” </span>(Isaiah 1:22), meaning you yourself dilute your wine with water and sell it. Since nobody behaved in proper manner, the judges were unable to judge.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who says that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the queen of Sheba [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">malkat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Sheva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who came to visit King Solomon (see I Kings, chapter 10) <span class="gemarra-regular">was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman is nothing other than mistaken. What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">malkat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheba? The kingdom [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">malkhuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of Sheba, </span>as is mentioned in Job: “And Sheba fell on them and took them away” (Job 1:15).
§ Having mentioned the book of Job, the Gemara addresses several matters relating to it. It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Now there was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day when the sons of God came to present themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Lord said to the Satan: From where do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you come? And the Satan answered </span>the Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking through it” (Job 1:6–7). The Satan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>God: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throughout the entire world and I have not found anyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as faithful as Your servant Abraham, to whom You said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in the breadth of it; for I will give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it to you” </span>(Genesis 13:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And even so, when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he did not find a place to bury Sarah before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he purchased </span>a burial site <span class="gemarra-regular">for four hundred silver shekels, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he did not find fault with Your ways </span>or complain about the fact that you had failed to fulfill Your promise.
<span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to the Satan: Have you considered My servant Job</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that there is none like him on earth, </span>a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?” (Job 1:8). About this <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That</span> which <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated about Job is greater than that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated about Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “For now I know that you fear God</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 22:12), <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Job it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">A perfect and an upright man, one who fears God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and turns away from evil” </span>(Job 1:8).
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of the aforementioned verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">“and turns away from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">evil”? Rabbi Abba bar Shmuel says: Job was forgiving with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his money. </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the way of the world </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one pays the storekeeper </span>for even <span class="gemarra-regular">half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span> of merchandise purchased from him. But if somebody bought an item of such little value from <span class="gemarra-regular">Job, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">would forgive him </span>his half-<span class="it-text">peruta</span>.
The Gemara continues to clarify the verses concerning Job. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then the Satan answered the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord, and said: Does Job fear God for naught? Have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You not made a hedge about him, and about his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house, </span>and about all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle is increased in the land” (Job 1:9–10). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You have blessed the work of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Anyone who took</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Job was blessed. </span>Not only was Job’s own handiwork blessed, but anybody who received anything from him was also blessed.
The Gemara continues with its explication of these verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And his livestock is increased </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aratz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the land” </span>(Job 1:10)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Job</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s livestock breached </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aretzu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the order of the world. </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the way of the world </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">wolves kill goats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job’s livestock, the goats</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> killed the wolves.</span>
The Gemara continues to relate the Satan’s challenge to God: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But now put forth Your hand, and touch all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he has, and he will curse You to Your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">face. And the Lord said to the Satan: Behold, all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he has is in your power; only upon himself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not put forth your hand. </span>And the Satan went out from the presence of the Lord” (Job 1:11–12). The verses relate what then occurred: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Now there was a day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine in their eldest brother’s house, and there came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were plowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the asses were feeding beside them” (Job 1:13–14). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The oxen were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plowing and the asses were feeding beside them”? Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, gave Job a taste</span>

Daf 16a

<span class="gemarra-regular">of the World-to-Come, </span>when plowing and harvesting will take place at the same time. Here too, the oxen plowed and the donkeys grazed on the crops that grew from that effort.
The Gemara continues to interpret verses from the book of Job. <span class="gemarra-regular">“While he was yet speaking, there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came also another and said: The fire of God </span>has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them…<span class="gemarra-regular">W</span><span class="gemarra-regular">hile he was yet speaking, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there came also another and said: The Chaldeans formed three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bands, and fell among the camels, and have carried them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">away, </span>and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword…<span class="gemarra-regular">While he was yet speaking, there came also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another and said: Your sons and your daughters were eating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house; and, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and smote the four corners of the house, and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fell upon the young men, </span>and they are dead…<span class="gemarra-regular">Then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Job arose, and rent his coat, and shaved his head, </span>and fell down on the ground and prostrated himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I came naked out of my mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">womb, and naked I shall return there; the Lord gave, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Lord. In all this Job sinned not, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did he lay reproach on God” </span>(Job 1:16–22).
<span class="gemarra-regular">“Again there was a day when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of God came to present themselves </span>before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them to present himself before God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Lord said to the Satan: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">From where do you come? And the Satan answered the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earth </span>and from walking up and down in it” (Job 2:1–2). The Satan <span class="gemarra-regular">said before </span>God: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of the Universe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I have gone to and fro across the entire world</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and have not found anyone as faithful as your servant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abraham, to whom you said: “Arise, walk through the land</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the length of it and in the breadth of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it; for I will give it to you” </span>(Genesis 13:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And when he wanted to bury Sarah, he could </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not find a place to bury her, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not criticize Your ways, </span>or accuse You of having failed to keep Your promise.
About this it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord said to the Satan: Have you considered My servant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Job, that there is none like him on earth, </span>a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and turns away from evil? <span class="gemarra-regular">And still he holds fast to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his integrity, although you moved Me against him, to destroy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him without cause” </span>(Job 2:3).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Were it not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the verse, it would be impossible to say this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse states: “You moved Me against him,” <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person whom others persuade and </span>allows himself to be <span class="gemarra-regular">persuaded, </span>as if God had not wanted to do anything, but allowed Himself to be persuaded to bring harm to Job.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> with regard to the methods of the Satan: He <span class="gemarra-regular">descends </span>to this world <span class="gemarra-regular">and misleads </span>a person into sinning. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">ascends </span>to Heaven, levels accusations against that very sinner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and inflames </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">anger </span>against him. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">receives permission </span>to act <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes away the </span>sinner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">soul </span>as punishment.
The Gemara returns to discuss the text of the book of Job: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Satan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> answered the Lord, and said: Skin for skin, for all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that a man has he will give for his life</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> face. And the Lord said to the Satan: Behold, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in your hand; only spare his life. So the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> smote Job </span>with vile sores from the sole of his foot to his crown” (Job 2:4–7). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Satan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s suffering was more difficult than that of Job. </span>This can be explained by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a parable involving a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> servant whose master said to him: Break the barrel but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> save its wine. </span>Here too, God told the Satan that he could do whatever he liked short of taking Job’s life, and that limitation caused Satan to suffer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: Satan, the evil inclination, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Angel of Death are one, </span>that is, they are three aspects of the same essence. <span class="gemarra-regular">He is the Satan </span>who seduces people and then accuses them, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “So the Satan went forth from the presence of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord, </span>and smote Job with vile sores” (Job 2:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the evil inclination, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“The impulse of the thoughts of his heart <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only evil continuously” </span>(Genesis 6:5); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Only upon himself do not put forth your hand” </span>(Job 1:12). The verbal analogy between the various uses of the word “only” teaches that the evil inclination is to be identified with the Satan. <span class="gemarra-regular">He is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the Angel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Death, as it is written: “Only spare his life” </span>(Job 2:6); <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently </span>Job’s life <span class="gemarra-regular">depends upon him, </span>the Satan, and accordingly the Satan must also be the Angel of Death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi says: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">Satan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who brought accusations against Job, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Peninnah, </span>who tormented Hannah, mother of Samuel the prophet, acted with <span class="gemarra-regular">intent </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of Heaven. </span>As for <span class="gemarra-regular">Satan, when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he saw that the Holy One, Blessed be He, inclined </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>favor <span class="gemarra-regular">Job </span>and praised him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Heaven forbid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that He should forget the love of Abraham. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Peninnah, as it is written: “And her rival wife </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also provoked her sore, to make her fret” </span>(I Samuel 1:6), i.e., Peninnah upset Hannah in order to motivate her to pray. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">in Paphunya, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Satan came and kissed his feet </span>in gratitude for speaking positively about him.
The Gemara considers the character of Job. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In all this Job did not sin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with his lips” </span>(Job 2:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>A close reading of the verse indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not sin with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his lips, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he sinned in his heart. What did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he say </span>that suggests that he had wicked thoughts? <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he covers the faces of its judges; if not he, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then who is it?” </span>(Job 9:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Job sought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to turn the bowl upside down, </span>that is to say, he alluded here to a heretical thought, as he said that the earth is given into the hand of the wicked, indicating that he had God in mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Job was referring </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">only to the Satan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he being the wicked one into whose hands the land was given.
The Gemara comments: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The earth is given into the hand of the wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” Rabbi Eliezer says: Job sought to turn the bowl upside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> down; Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Job was referring </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">only to the Satan.</span>
The Gemara continues to discuss Job’s statements: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Although You know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that I am not wicked, and there is none that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can deliver out of Your hand” </span>(Job 10:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Job sought to exempt the whole worl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from judgment, </span>claiming that all of a person’s actions are directed by God, and therefore one cannot be held culpable for his misdeeds. Job <span class="gemarra-regular">said before </span>God: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of the Universe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, You created the ox with split hooves, </span>making it kosher, and <span class="gemarra-regular">You created the donkey with closed hooves, </span>making it forbidden; <span class="gemarra-regular">You created the Garden of Eden, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">You created</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gehenna; </span>and similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">You created righteous people </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">You created</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked people; who can restrain You? </span>Seeing that You created people as either righteous or wicked, You cannot later complain about their actions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And how did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Job’s friends answer him? “You do away with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fear, and impair devotion before God” </span>(Job 15:4) with such statements. True, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, created </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the evil inclination, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">created the Torah </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">an antidote </span>to counter its effects and prevent it from gaining control of a person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava interpreted </span>a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written, </span>Job saying about himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The blessing of him that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was lost came upon me, and I caused the widow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s heart to sing for joy” </span>(Job 29:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">“The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blessing of him that was lost came upon me” teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>Job <span class="gemarra-regular">used to steal a field from orphans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> cultivate it, <span class="gemarra-regular">improve it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">return it to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them; </span>consequently, they would bless him for the field they had lost. <span class="gemarra-regular">“I caused the widow’s heart to sing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for joy” </span>teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that there was a widow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whom no one would marry, he would go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cast</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his name upon her, </span>i.e., he would start a rumor that she was related to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">somebody</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would </span>come forward and <span class="gemarra-regular">marry her.</span>
Job further said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“O </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that my vexation were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the balances” </span>(Job 6:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Dust </span>should be put <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mouth of Job, </span>meaning, he should not have spoken in such a manner, as if he were weighing his deeds against those of God; may one act as if he is in <span class="gemarra-regular">a friendship with Heaven? </span>And similarly, Job said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There is no arbiter between us, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who may lay his hand upon us both” </span>(Job 9:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Dust </span>should be put <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mouth of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Job </span>for saying this; <span class="gemarra-regular">is there a servant who rebukes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his master? </span>Job also said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I have made a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin?” </span>(Job 31:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Dust </span>should be put <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mouth </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job </span>for saying this; <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>did not look <span class="gemarra-regular">at other </span>women, but <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham did not even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> look at his own </span>wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I know that you are a beautiful woman” </span>(Genesis 12:11). One may learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that initially he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know </span>how beautiful she was because he had not gazed at her.
Job further said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who goes down to the grave shall come up no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more” </span>(Job 7:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: From here </span>it may be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that Job denied the resurrection of the dead, </span>as he said that one who goes down to the grave will not come up and live again, just as a cloud that dissipates will not return. He also stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without cause” </span>(Job 9:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: Job blasphemed with </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tempest and he was answered with </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tempest.</span>
Rabba explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He blasphemed with </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tempest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bise</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’ara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as it is written: “He crushes me with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tempest.” </span>Job <span class="gemarra-regular">said before </span>God: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of the Universe, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps a tempest passed before You and You confused </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Job, <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>enemy. <span class="gemarra-regular">He was answered with </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tempest, as it is written: “Then the Lord answered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Job out of the tempest, and said: </span>Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? <span class="gemarra-regular">Gird up now </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your loins like a man, for I will demand of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you and let me know your answer” </span>(Job 38:1–3).
What is the meaning of “out of the tempest”? God <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I have created many hairs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nimin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a person, and for each hair I created</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its own follicl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> through which the hair is sustained, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that two </span>hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">should not draw from one follicle. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As were two </span>hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">to draw from one follicle, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would impair a man’s vision. </span>Now, if <span class="gemarra-regular">I do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not confuse one follicle with another, would I confuse </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Hebrew word for tempest, <span class="it-text">se’ara</span>, is phonetically identical to the Hebrew word for hair.
God further said to Job: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who has divided a channel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">te’ala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the torrent </span>of rain, or a path for the lightning of thunder”? (Job 38:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">I have created many drops </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in the clouds, and for each drop I created</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its own channel, so that two drops should not emerge</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the same channel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As were two drops to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emerge from the same channel they would destroy the earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it would not yield produce. </span>Now, if <span class="gemarra-regular">I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not confuse one drop with another, would I confuse </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Incidentally, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred that this </span>term <span class="gemarra-italic">te’ala</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">a channel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rabba bar Sheila said: As it is written </span>with regard to Elijah the prophet: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he fashioned a channel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">te’ala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>about the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>great as would contain <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed” </span>(I Kings 18:32).
The second half of the aforementioned verse in Job states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or a path for the lightning of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thunder,” </span>which is interpreted as follows: God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">created many thunderclaps in the clouds, and for each and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every thunderclap I created its own path, so that two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thunderclaps should not issue forth from the same path. As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were two thunderclaps to issue from the same path, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would destroy the world. </span>Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">if I do not confuse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one thunderclap with another, would I confuse </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
It is further stated there: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Do you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know when the wild goats of the rock give birth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Can you mark when the hinds do calve?” </span>(Job 39:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">This goat is cruel to her young </span>and shows them no pity; <span class="gemarra-regular">when she squats</span>

Daf 16b

<span class="gemarra-regular">to give birth she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascends to the top of a mountain so that </span>the kid <span class="gemarra-regular">should fall down from her and die. And I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">summon her an eagle that receives it with his wings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and places it before her; and if </span>the eagle <span class="gemarra-regular">reached </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">one moment early or was one moment late, </span>the kid <span class="gemarra-regular">would immediately die. </span>Now, if <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not confuse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one moment with another moment, would I confuse </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
Similarly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Can you mark when the hinds do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> calve?” </span>(Job 39:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">The womb of this hind is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">narrow, </span>which makes for a difficult delivery. <span class="gemarra-regular">When she squats </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to give birth, I summon her a snake [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">derakon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that bites her at the opening of the womb, which </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes loose, and she gives birth, and if </span>the snake <span class="gemarra-regular">reached </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">one moment early or was one moment </span><span class="gemarra-regular">late, she would immediately die. </span>Now, if I <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">confuse one moment with another moment, would I confuse </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Iyov</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">oyev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara comments: On the one hand, the text states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Job has spoken without knowledge, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his words were without wisdom” </span>(Job 34:35). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>with regard to Job’s friends: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You have not spoken of Me the thing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is right, like my servant Job” </span>(Job 42:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From here </span>it may be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person is not held responsible </span>for what he says <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is in distress. </span>Although Job uttered certain words that were wrong and inappropriate, he was not punished for them because he said them at a time of pain and hardship.
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was come upon him, they came every one from his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to come to mourn with him and to comfort him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Job 2:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">“they had made an appointment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> together” </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: This </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that they all entered </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">one gat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> at the same time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">three hundred parasangs between each and every one </span>of them, i.e., each one lived three hundred parasangs away from the other.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">know </span>at the same time what had happened to Job so that the three of them came together? <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">had a crown </span>which displayed certain signs when something happened to one of the others. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say they </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">had trees and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">withered they knew </span>that sorrow had visited one of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>closeness between Job and his friends explains the adage <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: Either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a friend like the friends of Job or death. </span>If a person lacks close friends, he is better off dead.
The Gemara cites another place where Job is mentioned. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it came to pass</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, when men began to multiply [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">larov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] on the face of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the earth, and daughters were born to them” </span>(Genesis 6:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span><span class="it-text">Larov</span> means that <span class="gemarra-regular">propagation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">reviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the worl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> through these daughters. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: Strife</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meriva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] came to the world. </span>Once daughters were born, the men began to fight among themselves over them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to you who say </span>that due to the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">propagation came to the world, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">Job’s daughters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not doubled, </span>when at the end of the story God doubled everything that Job had lost (see Job 1:3, 42:12)?
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the numbers of Job’s daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">were not doubled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in name, </span>meaning they did not become twice as many, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they were doubled in beauty, as it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">He had also seven sons and three daughters. And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called the name of the first Jemimah, and the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the second was Keziah, and the name of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">third one was Keren-happuch” </span>(Job 42:13–14). All three names relate to the daughters’ beauty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Jemimah [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yemima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>in her beauty <span class="gemarra-regular">she was similar to the day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">om</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].

Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Ḥisda said: </span>She was <span class="gemarra-regular">like garden saffron [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kekurkema</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">derishka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is the best <span class="gemarra-regular">of its kind. </span><span class="it-text">Keren</span> refers to a garden, and <span class="it-text">pukh</span> means ornament, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Though you enlarge </span>your eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">with paint </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>you beautify yourself in vain” (Jeremiah 4:30).
It is reported that <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter was born to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he was upset </span>that he did not have a son. <span class="gemarra-regular">His father said to him: Propagation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has come to the world </span>through the birth of a daughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Bar Kappara said to </span>Rabbi Shimon: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your father has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consoled you with meaningless consolation, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The world cannot endure without males and females</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as both are needed for the perpetuation of humanity. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fortunate is he whose children are males and woe to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him whose children are females. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the world cannot endure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without either a spice dealer </span>whose wares are sweet-smelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a tanner [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bursi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who is engaged in a foul-smelling occupation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Fortunate is he whose occupation is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spice seller, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">woe to him whose occupation is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tanner.</span>
The Gemara comments that this disagreement is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord blessed Abraham with everything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 24:1), and the Sages disagree about <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span> means. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>The blessing is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not have a daughter. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>On the contrary, the blessing was <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he had a daughter. Others say: Abraham had a daughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and her name was Bakkol. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abraham our forefather was so knowledgeable in astrology [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itztagninut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that all the kings of the East and the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would come early to his door </span>due to his wisdom. This is the blessing of <span class="it-text">bakkol</span>, that he possessed knowledge that everybody needed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: A precious</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stone hung around the neck of Abraham our forefather; any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sick person who looked at it would immediately be healed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. When Abraham our forefather died, the Holy One, Blessed be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He, hung </span>this stone <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sphere of the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which from that point on brought healing to the sick. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>explains the adage <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day progresses, sickness is lifted.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>what is the blessing of <span class="it-text">bakkol</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">That Esau did not rebel in </span>Abraham’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime, </span>that is to say, as long as Abraham lived Esau did not sin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the blessing of <span class="it-text">bakkol</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that Ishmael repented in </span>Abraham’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">Esau did not rebel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>Abraham’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime? As it is written: </span>“And Jacob was cooking a stew <span class="gemarra-regular">and Esau came in from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the field and he was faint” </span>(Genesis 25:29), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: On that day Abraham our forefather passed away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Jacob our forefather prepared a lentil stew to comfort</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Isaac, his father, </span>as it was customary to serve mourners lentil stew.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is different about lentils </span>that they in particular are the fare customarily offered to mourners? <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Mari: Just as this lentil has no mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it does not have a crack like other legumes, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too a mourner has no mouth, </span>that is, his anguish prevents him from speaking. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, just as this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lentil is </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">round, so too mourning comes around to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the inhabitants of the world. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two explanations? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to whether it is appropriate <span class="gemarra-regular">to console </span>a mourner <span class="gemarra-regular">with eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which have no opening but are not completely round.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked </span>Esau <span class="gemarra-regular">committed five transgressions on that day </span>that Abraham died: <span class="gemarra-regular">He engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed maiden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he killed a person, he denied the principle </span>of God’s existence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he denied resurrection of the dead, and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> despised the birthright.</span>
The Gemara cites proofs to support these charges. <span class="gemarra-regular">He engaged in sexual intercourse with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a betrothed maiden, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written here: “And Esau</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came in from the field”; and it is written there</span> with regard to rape of a betrothed maiden: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he found her in a field” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">He killed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written here: </span>“And he was <span class="gemarra-regular">faint”; and it is written there: “Woe is me, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for my soul faints before the slayers” </span>(Jeremiah 4:31). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he denied the principle </span>of God’s existence, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written here: “What profit is this to me” </span>(Genesis 25:32); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there: “This is my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">God and I will glorify Him” </span>(Exodus 15:2). When he questioned the profit of “this,” he was challenging the assertion that “this is my God.” <span class="gemarra-regular">And he denied resurrection of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the dead, as it is written: “Behold, I am at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the point of death” </span>(Genesis 25:32), indicating that he did not believe in resurrection after death. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he despised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the birthright, as it is written: “And Esau despised the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birthright” </span>(Genesis 25:34).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that Ishmael repented in </span>Abraham’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime? From </span>the incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina and Rav Ḥama bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Buzi, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">were sitting before Rava, and Rava was dozing</span> while they were talking. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ḥama bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Buzi: Is it true that you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to which </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">gevia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>expire, is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">is the death of the righteous? </span>Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes. </span>For example: “And Isaac expired [<span class="it-text">vayyigva</span>], and died” (Genesis 35:29). Ravina objected: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the generation of the flood </span>it states: “And all flesh expired [<span class="it-text">vayyigva</span>]” (Genesis 7:21), and there they died for their wickedness. Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this only when both <span class="gemarra-italic">gevia</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>gathering, are used; when these two terms are mentioned together they indicate the death of a righteous person.
Ravina asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there Ishmael, about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gevia</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asif</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are written, </span>as it is stated: “And these are the years of the life of Yishmael…and he expired and died [<span class="it-text">vayyigva</span> <span class="it-text">vayyamot</span>]; and was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Meanwhile Rava, </span>who had heard the discussion in his dozed state, fully <span class="gemarra-regular">awoke </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Children [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dardekei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is what Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan says: Ishmael repented in the lifetime of his father,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, buried him” </span>(Genesis 25:9). The fact that Ishmael allowed Isaac to precede him demonstrates that he had repented and accepted his authority.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">listed them in the order of their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wisdom; </span>that is to say, perhaps in fact Ishmael preceded Isaac but the Torah did not list them in that order. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, </span>consider that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Esau and Jacob, his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons, buried him” </span>(Genesis 35:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the verse there <span class="gemarra-regular">did not list them in the order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of their wisdom? Rather, since </span>Ishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">allowed </span>Isaac <span class="gemarra-regular">to precede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>it is clear that he <span class="gemarra-regular">made </span>Isaac <span class="gemarra-regular">his leader</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and since he made him his leader, learn from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he repented in </span>Abraham’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime.</span>
Incidental to the discussion of the verse “And God blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1), the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">to whom the Holy One, Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be He, gave </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">in this world</span>

Daf 17a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a taste of the World-to-Come</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written with regard to him: </span>“And the Lord blessed Abraham <span class="gemarra-regular">with everything” </span>(Genesis 24:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaac, as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to him: </span>“And I have eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everything” </span>(Genesis 27:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob, as it is written with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>“Because I have <span class="gemarra-regular">everything” </span>(Genesis 33:11). This teaches that already in their lifetimes they merited everything, i.e., perfection.
There were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">over whom the evil inclination had no sway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to them, </span>respectively: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With everything,” “from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everything,” “everything.” </span>The completeness of their blessings means that they did not have to contend with their evil inclinations. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even David </span>was not subject to his evil inclination, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And my heart has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">died within me” </span>(Psalms 109:22), meaning that the evil inclination in his heart was nullified as if his heart had died. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>authority, who does not include David in his list, explain this verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">He is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mentioning his travails. </span>David means to say that his heart died within him owing to all the suffering that he endured, but he says nothing about his evil inclination.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">over whom the Angel of Death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had no sway </span>in their demise, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are: Abraham</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Abraham, Isaac, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jacob, as it is written </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to them, </span>respectively: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With everything,” “from everything,” “everything”; </span>since they were blessed with everything they were certainly spared the anguish of the Angel of Death. <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>that they died <span class="gemarra-regular">“by the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mouth of the Lord” </span>(Numbers 33:38; Deuteronomy 34:5), which indicates that they died with a kiss, and not at the hand of the Angel of Death.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Miriam it is not written: “By the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mouth of the Lord.” Rabbi Elazar says: Miriam also died </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a kiss, as this is learned </span>through a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“there” </span>mentioned in regard to Miriam: “And Miriam died there” (Numbers 20:1), and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">there” </span>mentioned in regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses: </span>“And Moses died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">is “by the mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord” not stated with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">her? It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is unseemly to mention </span>death by a kiss with regard to a woman.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">over whom the worm and the maggot had no sway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob. Abraham, Isaac, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob, as it is written with regard to them, </span>respectively: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With everything,” “from everything,” “everything.” Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written with regard to them: “By the mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord”; Benjamin, son of Jacob, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “And to Benjamin he said: The beloved of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord, he shall dwell in safety by Him” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:12). Even in death, he rests securely, unbothered by worms. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even David </span>is included, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “My flesh also dwells secure” </span>(Psalms 16:9). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>authority, who does not include David, explain this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is asking for mercy, </span>that his flesh should dwell secure and not be subject to worms and maggots, but his request was denied.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who died </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the counsel of the </span>primordial <span class="gemarra-regular">snake, </span>in the wake of which all of humanity became mortal, and not on account of any personal sin. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they are: Benjamin, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Jacob; Amram, father of Moses; Yishai, father of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">David; and Chileab, son of David. And all of these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are known through tradition except for Yishai, father of David, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whom <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written explicitly: “And Absalom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed Amasa over the army instead of Joab, and Amasa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was the son of a man whose name was Ithra </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Israelite, who engaged in intercourse with Abigail, daughter of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab” </span>(II Samuel 17:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">But was </span>Abigail <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter of Nahash? Was she</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not the daughter of Yishai, as it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail” </span>(I Chronicles 2:16)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>she was called “daughter of Nahash” to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">she was the daughter of one who died </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the counsel of the snake.</span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">di</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">close to the pit of another, </span>in order to avoid damaging the latter’s pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, one <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>dig <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch, nor a cave, </span>i.e., a covered pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor a water channel, nor a launderer’s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">pond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a pit used for washing clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he distanced </span>all of these <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wall of another and he plasters lime </span>on the place where there is water.

Daf 17b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">opens by </span>speaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit: </span>A person may not dig a pit close to the pit of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">he ends with </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall: </span>Unless he distances it from the wall of another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Unless he distanced </span>his pit or ditch <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from the pit of another, </span>just as he begins his statement by referring to a pit. Why does the mishna suddenly mention a wall here?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say it was Rav Yehuda </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>that the mishna means: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the wall of his pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, one should read the mishna as follows: Unless he distanced his pit or ditch three handbreadths from the wall of another’s pit. The neighbor also built his pit close to the border between the two properties, and the mishna is teaching that the one digging a pit must distance it three handbreadths from the wall of the pit of the other.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Unless he distanced </span>his excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from the pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another, </span>and one would understand that the term pit is referring to the wall of the other’s pit. The Gemara responds: By using the phrase: From the wall of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this teaches us </span>incidentally <span class="gemarra-regular">that the wall of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pit </span>must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>thick, as the wall of the other’s pit occupied the full three handbreadths between the cavity of his pit and the property of his neighbor. The practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>of this observation is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to buying and selling, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says to another: I am selling you a pit and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wall </span>of the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">must be </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>thick.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who comes to </span>dig any of these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>any of the items listed in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">close</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of his field, where his neighbor currently has no pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: He may </span>dig or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may not </span>dig or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">All agree that he may not</span> dig or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field </span>of his neighbor if <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he will thereby restrict his neighbor from using his field in the manner it is expected to be used. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a field</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He may </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close</span> to the boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the neighbor’s field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not designated for pits, </span>so he is not causing any damage by doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: He may not </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the neighbor can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Just as you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> changed your mind and dug </span>a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">I too </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">change my mind and dig </span>a pit, and I will no longer be able to dig near my border if you dig your pit close to the boundary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of this discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">All agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that is not designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits. When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a field that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits. Abaye says: One may </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary; and this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>in the mishna (25b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>lest the roots of the tree grow and damage a neighbor’s cistern in his field. The difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there it </span>is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when he plants </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern. But here, </span>at the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he digs </span>his cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>as yet <span class="gemarra-regular">no cistern </span>in his neighbor’s field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary; and this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in that same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This one may dig in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one may plant in his </span>field, i.e., one need not distance his tree for fear of damaging his neighbor’s field through expanding roots. The reason that Rava maintains that his ruling is correct even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, as when he plants </span>the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">its roots, which </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">damage the cistern, are not </span>yet present. Consequently, when he plants he does not cause any damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>the neighbor can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Each and every strike of yours with the hoe loosens </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my earth, </span>and therefore you are already causing damage as you dig your cistern.
The Gemara suggests a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not dig a pit close to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pit of another, </span>unless he does so at a distance of three handbreadths from his neighbor’s wall. The Gemara analyzes this statement: Apparently, the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>he may not dig close to the boundary of his neighbor’s field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that there is a pit </span>there, from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no pit he </span>may dig his pit <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to his neighbor’s wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to that </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you said: All agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span>dig these excavations or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field that is not designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, </span>one can explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a field that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to a field that is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, </span>there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>who says that one may dig one’s pit near the boundary when the neighbor has no pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>who maintains that it is prohibited to dig a pit near the boundary under any circumstances, the ruling of this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Wasn’t it stated with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says, and some say it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>that the mishna means: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the wall of his pit? </span>This indicates that the neighbor must distance the edge of his pit from the boundary by the thickness of his wall, which is three handbreadths. Therefore, even according to the ruling of the mishna, one may not dig his pit directly adjacent to the boundary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>this discussion in the form of a challenge to the opinion of Abaye. The mishna teaches that one must distance his pit from that of his neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was stated with regard to that </span>ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says, and some say it was Rav Yehuda </span>who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>that it means: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the wall of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his pit. </span>In other words, the edge of the neighbor’s pit must be three handbreadths away from the boundary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which you said: All agree that he may not </span>dig or <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field </span>of his neighbor if <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, </span>one can explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a field that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to that </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a field that is designated for </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, </span>there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>who says that it is prohibited to dig a pit near the boundary in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>the ruling of this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as if the mishna is referring to the wall of the neighbor’s pit, this indicates that the first pit was dug close to the boundary.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The mishna </span>is referring to the specific case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>both neighbors <span class="gemarra-regular">came to</span> dig their <span class="gemarra-regular">pits at the same time. </span>Consequently, they must both distance their pits from one another. If there is no pit as yet next to the boundary, and the neighbor is not digging at that point, one may dig his pit alongside the boundary.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rock that </span>is so soft that it <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and no tool is needed, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may dig his pit from here, and that one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dig his pit from there. This one distances </span>his pit <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths and plasters with lime, and that one distances</span> his pit <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths and plasters with lime. </span>This indicates that the first one who digs a pit must distance his pit even when the second one does not yet have a pit. The Gemara rejects this proof: Rock that <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In this case, one must maintain a distance from the boundary due to the softness of the ground.
The Gemara is puzzled by this exchange: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he who asked it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why did he ask it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is explicitly referring to rock that crumbles in one’s hands, so this is clearly a unique case. The Gemara answers that the Sage who asked the question assumed that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> includes all types of soil, and he thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary for</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to mention the specific example of rock that <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>as it could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind to say that since </span>this substance <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands he is required </span>to keep his pit at an even <span class="gemarra-regular">greater distance. </span>To counter this, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that a distance of three handbreadths is sufficient.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> solid residue </span>of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">manure, and</span>

Daf 18a

<span class="gemarra-regular">salt, and lime, and rocks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three handbreadths from the wall of another, or he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">plaster </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">with lime. </span>The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall </span>there belonging to his neighbor, from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no wall </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may place </span>these substances <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary of his neighbor’s courtyard. This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Rava according to the first version of the dispute, which states that one may not place these substances close to a boundary even in the case of a field that is not designated for pits.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no wall one may also not place </span>these substances <span class="gemarra-regular">close</span> to the boundary. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>mentioning a wall here <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>substances <span class="gemarra-regular">are damaging to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wall.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance seeds, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the plow, and urine three handbreadths from the wall </span>of another. The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is a wall, </span>from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no wall, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may place </span>these substances <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary of the field. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no wall, one may also not place </span>these substances <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by the boundary. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rather, what does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that dampness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dimtunta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is damaging to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a wall.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one must distance <span class="gemarra-regular">a mill </span>from a wall by <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the lower stone </span>of the mill, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the upper stone. </span>The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wall, </span>from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no wall, one may place </span>a mill <span class="gemarra-regular">close</span> by the boundary. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no wall, one may also not place</span> his mill <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by the boundary. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, what does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that vibrations are damaging to a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the oven</span> must be distanced <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the base, which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the upper rim </span>of the oven. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is a wall, </span>from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no wall, one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>an oven <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by the boundary.

The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna (20b): <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not open a baker</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dye shop beneath </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">storeroom of another, nor may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>open <span class="gemarra-regular">a cattle barn </span>there. The Gemara analyzes this mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a storeroom </span>already in place, from which it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no storeroom one may do</span> so. If this is the case, then with regard to a pit as well, one may dig next to a boundary if there is as yet no pit.
The Gemara answers: The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as in general one can use his domicile in any manner of his choosing unless he directly causes damage to another or his property. The Gemara adds: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as </span>an explicit <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught with regard to that </span>mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the construction of <span class="gemarra-regular">the cattle barn preceded the storeroom, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Nothing can be inferred from the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna, which does not concern living quarters.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not plant a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree close to </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">field unless he distances it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits from </span>his neighbor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to this </span>mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits of </span>which the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>enable <span class="gemarra-regular">the work of the vineyard,</span> i.e., a small space next to the trees is necessary to enable animals to plow between them.
The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>this distance is required <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to the work of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vineyard, </span>from which it may be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> for the problem <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the work of the vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it would be permitted for one to plant his tree <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>apparently, this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though there are roots </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage </span>his neighbor’s field. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a hard <span class="gemarra-regular">rock [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzunema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interrupts </span>between the two fields, preventing the roots from passing through to the other field.
The Gemara continues: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise</span> with regard to this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>further on: If there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a fence between them, this one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">places, </span>i.e., plants a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, and that one places, </span>i.e., plants a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fence from here. </span>If the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> were referring to a case where the roots could travel across, how could it be permitted for both neighbors to plant their trees alongside each other? Consequently, it must be referring to a situation where a rock separates between the two fields below, and therefore the neighbors may plant their trees near the fence.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the last clause </span>of that mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the roots </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">extended into </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another, </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut them off to a depth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of three handbreadths, so that they do not impede the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plow. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if a rock interrupts </span>between the two fields and forms a barrier, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are </span>these roots <span class="gemarra-regular">doing there, </span>i.e., how did they get there? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: And if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no rock, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the roots </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">extended into </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut them off to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> depth of three handbreadths so that they do not impede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the plow.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (25b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern. </span>The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that there is a cistern, </span>from which it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no cistern, one may place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., plant, his tree <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s field. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no cistern one may also not place </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by mentioning a cistern, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: That the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roots </span>of a tree <span class="gemarra-regular">extend and damage the cistern up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-five cubits </span>away.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, say the last clause </span>of that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tree preceded </span>the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down </span>the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not place </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the boundary even if there is no cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find </span>a case where the tree preceded the cistern? Why would its owner not be required to cut it down? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Pappa says </span>with regard to a similar matter, that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a buyer </span>who purchases part of a field. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too </span>here, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a buyer. </span>In other words, a field contained a cistern and tree alongside each other, and the owner sold the part of the field containing the cistern.
The Gemara cites yet another source: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (25a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distance the water in which flax is steeped from vegetables</span> growing in a neighbor’s field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one must distance <span class="gemarra-regular">leeks from onion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> growing in a neighbor’s field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one must likewise distance <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard from bees </span>that are in a neighbor’s field. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason is that there are vegetables </span>present, from which it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vegetables, one may place </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s field. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are no vegetables one may also not place </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that these </span>items mentioned in that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">are harmful to each other.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the last</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei renders it permitted </span>to plant near the neighbor’s bees <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard. </span>As explained in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can say to </span>the owner of the bees: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say to me: Keep your mustard away from my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bees, </span>I can say to you: <span class="gemarra-regular">Keep your bees away</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from my mustard, as they come and eat my mustard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, you are damaging my property as well. 

Daf 18b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not place </span>an item that might cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to his neighbor’s boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find </span>a case where each neighbor is damaging the property of the other? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a buyer </span>who purchased part of his neighbor’s field, and it contains a substance or items that might cause damage, e.g., the water in which flax is steeped or mustard. In the other section of the field the neighbor retained an item or substance that could be damaged. In this manner, it is possible for the item that causes damage to be found near the boundary of the neighbor without one having violated the ruling of the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a buyer, what is the reason of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, </span>who say that the neighbor can demand that the buyer distance that which causes damage? After all, he has not acted improperly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, what is the reason of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei </span>for disagreeing only in the case of the mustard and the bees? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which flax is steeped and vegetables </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>subject to the same reasoning: Why should he have to distance his water, considering that he did not act improperly?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the explanation is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis hold </span>that the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who causes damage to distance himself. </span>The one who has the potential to cause damage must act to prevent the damage from occurring. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> even if his initial placement was done in accordance with <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as in the case where one bought part of a field.
The Gemara asks: Does this prove <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who disagrees with the ruling of the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that </span>that the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span> one whose property <span class="gemarra-regular">was damaged to distance himself; </span>i.e., to avoid being damaged? But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the responsibility to distance oneself falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>one whose property <span class="gemarra-regular">was damaged</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water in which flax </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is steeped and vegetables </span>the owner should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not have to distance himself. Why does Rabbi Yosei distinguish between that situation and the case of bees and mustard?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">actually Rabbi Yosei also holds </span>that the responsibility to distance oneself falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the one who causes damage, </span>even if he did not act improperly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei is saying to the Rabbis: </span>Your explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">works out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">water in which flax is steeped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and vegetables, </span>where the one who causes damage must distance himself, as <span class="gemarra-regular">these damage those, but those do not damage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>i.e., the water in which flax is steeped damages the vegetables, but the vegetables do not damage the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard and bees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they both damage one another. </span>In light of this factor, and since the initial planting of the mustard was permitted, the owner of the bees should distance them from the mustard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>how do they respond to this claim? They maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">bees do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage mustard. </span>Their reasoning is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a seed, </span>the bees will <span class="gemarra-regular">not fin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a leaf, it will grow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> back, </span>and therefore no damage has been caused.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Yosei hold </span>that the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the one who causes damage to distance himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (25b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Even though the cistern preceded the tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the owner need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut down </span>the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">as this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one digs a cistern in his </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plants </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, actually Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>one whose property <span class="gemarra-regular">was damaged to distance himself. And </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis in accordance with their statement.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: Rabbi Yosei was saying to the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">In my </span>opinion, the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>one whose property <span class="gemarra-regular">was damaged to distance himself, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water in which flax is steeped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and vegetables, </span>the owner of the water <span class="gemarra-regular">need not distance </span>himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to your </span>opinion, that the responsibility falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the one who causes damage </span>to distance himself, this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">water in which flax </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is steeped and vegetables, as these damage those and those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not damage these. But mustard and bees both damage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one another, </span>and if the mustard owner acted properly, the owner of the bees should be required to move his bees.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>respond to this claim? They hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">bees do not damage mustard: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a seed, </span>

Daf 19a

the bees will <span class="gemarra-regular">not find it; if </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a leaf, it will grow back.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor </span>may one set up <span class="gemarra-regular">a launderer’s pond </span>near his neighbor’s wall unless he distances it three handbreadths from the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught this only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a soaking pond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which soiled clothes are left to soak for several days. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a washing pond [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hanadyan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where clothes are actively cleaned, <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>are required. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A launderer’s pond </span>must be kept <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from one’s neighbor’s wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that one must keep a distance of only <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths? Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>is correct?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some raise </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">as a contradiction, </span>and present the mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as apparently conflicting sources. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a launderer’s pond </span>must be kept <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadths </span>from his neighbor’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>are required? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult. Here, </span>the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a soaking pond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which requires three handbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a washing pond, </span>in which case four cubits are necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, teaches </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly</span> as reading: <span class="gemarra-regular">Unless he distanced three handbreadths from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rim of the soaking pond and the wall.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that one who digs a pit must distance it three handbreadths from another’s property and <span class="gemarra-regular">plaster </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with lime. A dilemma was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised before </span>the Sages: What is the precise wording of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Did we learn: And plasters with lime,</span> meaning that the walls must be plastered with lime in addition to distancing the pit three handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned: Or plasters with lime, </span>i.e., one may plaster the walls with lime instead of digging the pit at a distance of three handbreadths.
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that we learned: And plasters with lime</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as, if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: Or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plasters with lime, </span>which is the same as what is stated in the clause of the mishna discussing olive refuse, <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">combine them and teach them</span> together. If the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applied in all circumstances, all of the mishna’s cases could be taught together.
The Gemara answers: This is not proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps</span> these cases are taught separately <span class="gemarra-regular">because this </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not similar to that </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. The first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the mishna addresses the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>due <span class="gemarra-regular">to moisture, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>addresses the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>due <span class="gemarra-regular">to heat.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">rock that </span>is so soft it <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, this one digs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his pit from here, </span>on his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> digs his pit from there. This one distances </span>his pit <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths and plasters with lime, and that one distances</span> his pit <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths and plasters with lime. </span>The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The specific <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>one must also plaster with lime is that he is using rock that <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>from which it may be inferred that if it is rock that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not crumble in</span> one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>one would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be required to plaster with lime as well.
The Gemara answers: One could say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same is true, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">that even though </span>he is using rock <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not crumble in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">also plaster with lime. And it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary for </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to mention the case of rock that <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>as it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it crumbles in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, let us require a greater distance. </span>Therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must distance the solid residue </span>of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">manure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and salt, and lime, and rocks </span>three handbreadths from the wall of another, or plaster its receptacle with lime. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 47b): <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>substances <span class="gemarra-regular">may one insulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with what </span>substances <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one not insulate </span>it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">One may insulate </span>the pot <span class="gemarra-regular">neither with the solid residue </span>of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with manure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor with salt, nor with lime, nor with sand, whether</span> those materials are <span class="gemarra-regular">moist </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">dry. </span>All of these materials spontaneously generate heat when piled up for an extended period of time. Therefore, they add heat to the pot they insulate. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rocks and it does not teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand, and what is different there that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it does not teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rocks?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says: </span>There is a practical reason for this difference. Rocks are not mentioned there <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not customary for people to insulate </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">with rocks. Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: And is it customary for people to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> insulate </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">with wool fleece and tabs of purple wool</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may insulate</span> food <span class="gemarra-regular">with wool fleece; with combed wool clumps, </span>which are unwoven; <span class="gemarra-regular">with tabs of purple wool</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and with </span>swatches of <span class="gemarra-regular">soft material; but </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not move the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> on Shabbat because they are set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>].
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> follows the biblical aphorism in the verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its neighbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tells about him” </span>(Job 36:33), i.e., one example is mentioned and the same applies to the other case. <span class="gemarra-regular">He taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rocks here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true of sand; he taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand there and the same </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is true of rocks. Rava said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is correct, that <span class="gemarra-regular">“its neighbor tells about him,” let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>these examples <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of just <span class="gemarra-regular">one in the other </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it can be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: There, this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rocks: Because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they break, </span>i.e., scratch, <span class="gemarra-regular">the pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and consequently people do not use them for insulating food at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sand: Because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it heats hot </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">and cools cold </span>items, and therefore it does not cause any damage to the wall.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Oshaya taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that one must distance <span class="gemarra-regular">sand </span>from his neighbor’s wall. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to damp </span>sand, which must be kept at a distance due to its moisture. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">also teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of sand <span class="gemarra-regular">and we will interpret it </span>as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to damp</span> sand. The Gemara answers: This <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">already taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel, </span>which is a source of dampness, and therefore there was no need to mention damp sand as well.
The Gemara rejects this answer: That is incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">is that to say </span>that the mishna includes only one example of a source of dampness? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel? And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a launderer’s pond. </span>This demonstrates that the mishna teaches many cases, despite the similarity between them, and therefore it should have mentioned the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of sand as well.
The Gemara answers: Both of <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>particular examples <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary, as, had </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>only the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel, </span>one would have claimed that a distance must be kept <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is fixed, </span>i.e., water constantly passes through it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a launderer’s pond, which is not fixed, </span>as it sometimes holds water and sometimes does not, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that one need <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>distance it from his neighbor’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>only the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a launderer’s pond, </span>one might have said that this must be distanced <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its water <span class="gemarra-regular">is fixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and standing </span>in one location and therefore leaks out. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel, </span>one might say distancing it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary </span>to state both examples. By contrast, including the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of sand would not add any novel understanding.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance seeds, </span>i.e., one may not plant seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one may not operate <span class="gemarra-regular">the plow, </span>and one must eliminate urine, three handbreadths from the wall of another. The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to mention <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds? </span>Let him <span class="gemarra-regular">derive this </span>requirement to distance the seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the requirement to distance <span class="gemarra-regular">a plow, </span>as in any event the ground must be plowed before it can be sown? The Gemara answers: This is referring to planting <span class="gemarra-regular">with a single hand motion, </span>which is performed without plowing.
The Gemara further challenges: The mishna teaches that one must distance <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plow; but </span>let him <span class="gemarra-regular">derive this </span>requirement to distance a plow <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the requirement to distance the <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, </span>as plowing is preparation for planting. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who plows </span>to prepare the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trees. </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, let him <span class="gemarra-regular">derive this </span>requirement to distance a plow due to the requirement to distance the <span class="gemarra-regular">water. </span>If there are trees, there must be a water channel to irrigate them, and arranging one’s field in such a manner should be prohibited for that reason. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is referring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Eretz Yisrael, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is written: “And drinks </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water as the rain of heaven comes down” </span>(Deuteronomy 11:11). In Eretz Yisrael, water channels were not needed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that seeds</span>

Daf 19b

<span class="gemarra-regular">take root </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the sides, </span>i.e., the growing roots spread sideways and cause damage to walls? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 7:1): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bend</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a branch of <span class="gemarra-regular">a grapevin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the ground </span>so that it strikes roots and produces a new vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it does not have three handbreadths of earth over </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it he may not plant a seed above </span>it, as he would thereby transgress the prohibition of diverse kinds?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught with regard to </span>this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may plant on either sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of that bent branch. This indicates that there is no concern that the roots of the seeds will spread out sideways. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥagga says in the name of Rabbi Yosei: </span>The issue here is not that the roots will spread out sideways and reach the wall. Rather, it is prohibited to plant seeds near one’s neighbor’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">because they break</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up the groun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cause loose soil to rise </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up, </span>which damages the foundation of the wall.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And urine </span>must be kept at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from the wall</span> of one’s neighbor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to urinate alongside the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall of another, as it is written: “And I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cut off from Ahab those who urinate against the wall, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and him that is shut up and him that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">left at large in Israel” </span>(I Kings 21:21). As the verse employs the term “those who urinate against the wall” to mean males, it seems that urinating against a wall was a common practice. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">urine </span>must be kept a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from the wall? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the mishna is referring to urine <span class="gemarra-regular">that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> poure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from a chamber pot, as opposed to urine that is passed from the body.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person may not pour wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the side of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall of another unless he distances </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it. </span>If pouring water is prohibited, then all the more so should urination be prohibited. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, </span>it is referring to urine <span class="gemarra-regular">that is poured </span>from a chamber pot.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not urinat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alongside the wall of another unless he distances </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths from it. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a brick wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a stone wall, </span>one must distance himself <span class="gemarra-regular">enough so that it does not cause</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage. And how far </span>must he distance himself? One <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">hard roc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> present, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to urinate there. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana is a conclusive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">refutation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and his ruling is rejected.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabba bar bar Ḥana stated a verse </span>in support of his opinion; how can the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rule counter to what is written in a verse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying there, </span>i.e., this is the meaning of that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not even leave</span> Ahab <span class="gemarra-regular">something whose manner is to urinate against a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And what is that? A dog. </span>According to this interpretation, the verse is not referring to people at all.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tovi bar Kisna say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: A wafer does not reduce </span>the dimensions <span class="gemarra-regular">of a window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When a corpse, or a significant part thereof, is in one room, its impurity can spread to a room adjacent to it if there is a window of a certain size between the rooms. Shmuel states that when one puts a wafer in a window, the wafer is not considered an obstruction, so the size of the opening as relevant to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> remains the same. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>this case? Why does Shmuel teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wafer? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even a thick </span>chunk of bread <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>does not reduce the dimensions of a window.
The Gemara answers: Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">thick </span>bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him </span>to consume, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not nullify it, </span>i.e., he does not plan to leave it in the window for an extended amount of time. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wafer, which </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">disgustin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> when placed in a window, <span class="gemarra-regular">I might say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does nullify</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>and it becomes part of the house, thereby reducing the size of the window. To counter this, Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that even a wafer is not nullified, as it can be used to feed animals, as one is not particular about their food. Therefore, the wafer does not become part of the window in which it is placed.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>let him <span class="gemarra-regular">derive this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the fact that a wafer is <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that is susceptible to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ritual impurity, and any item that is susceptible to impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not serve as a barrier against </span>the spread of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>The Gemara explains: This is referring to a wafer <span class="gemarra-regular">that was kneaded in fruit juice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is not one of the liquids that renders food susceptible to ritual impurity, and therefore the wafer is not susceptible to ritual impurity. Consequently, one might have thought that it serves as a barrier before ritual impurity and reduces the dimensions of the window.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Shmuel’s opinion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Oholot</span> 6:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">full</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of straw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>an earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel full of dried</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> figs, which are placed in a window, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">considers: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the straw or dried figs would stand on their own</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were </span>the basket or barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">removed, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they would serve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a barrier against </span>the spread of impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if</span> they would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stand on their own <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> serve as a barrier. </span>The Gemara explains the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> why should the straw or dried figs serve as a barrier? Even <span class="gemarra-regular">straw </span>that can stand on its own <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit for </span>feeding to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s animal </span>and will likely be removed from the opening, which means it should not be considered part of the window.
The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to rotted </span>straw, which is unfit for animal consumption. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit for </span>use in the making of <span class="gemarra-regular">clay </span>for bricks. The Gemara answers: This is referring to straw <span class="gemarra-regular">that has thorns in i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and therefore is not fit for making bricks. The Gemara challenges: Even so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for kindling </span>a fire. The Gemara answers that this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wet </span>straw. The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kindling a large </span>fire. If one builds a large fire, wet straw will dry and become ignitable. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A large fire is not common, </span>and therefore, in all likelihood, the straw will remain in the window.
The Gemara further asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit for him </span>to consume, and he will certainly remove them. Consequently, they should not be considered fixed in their place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the figs <span class="gemarra-regular">became worm infested [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beshehitrifu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh teaches: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the figs <span class="gemarra-regular">became worm infested.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the </span>exact <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances of this barrel </span>that held the dried figs? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">opening faced outward, </span>i.e., not toward the source of the ritual impurity, 

Daf 20a

<span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">itself serve as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barrier. </span>It should not be susceptible to impurity in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as an earthenware vessel does not contract impurity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if its exterior </span>is exposed to impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say <span class="gemarra-regular">that its opening faces inward, </span>and it is rendered impure because the impurity enters through its opening. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually its opening faces outward, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a metal barrel, </span>which does contract impurity through its exterior.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>to the assumption that an item for which there is a use does not reduce the dimensions of a window, even if is not susceptible to impurity, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Oholot</span> 14:6): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">gras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plucke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and placed in a window or that grew </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on its own in windows; and scraps of fabri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not measure three by three </span>fingerbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">limb or flesh danglin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from an animal or a beast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and a bird resting in the window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile sittin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>a child <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>months of pregnancy, who is not expected to survive, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is placed in the window; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and an earthenware vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all these reduce the dimensions of the window. </span>Consequently, impurity passes through only if there remains an open space of a square handbreadth. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">snow, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hail</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> frost, ice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and water, all these do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not reduce the dimensions of a window.</span>
The Gemara proceeds to challenge Shmuel’s ruling from each of the cases of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to Shmuel, who says that an item that has a use is not considered part of the window and does not reduce the dimensions of the space, <span class="gemarra-regular">grass is fit </span>for consumption by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s animal, </span>so it will not remain in the window. Yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that grass reduces the dimensions of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">afrazta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is poisonous grass that is unfit for an animal to consume.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>grass <span class="gemarra-regular">that grew on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own </span>also reduces the dimensions of the window. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the grass <span class="gemarra-regular">damages the wall, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will remove it. </span>Therefore, it should not serve as a barrier to impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a wall of a ruin, </span>whose structural integrity is insignificant, and therefore the owner will not trouble himself to remove the grass. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> may even be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a wall </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a settled </span>house, and it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the grass <span class="gemarra-regular">comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">window. </span>In other words, the grass does not grow on the window but takes root some distance away, and from there it reaches the window. The homeowner is not particular about this grass and will not uproot it.
The Gemara further asks: Why do <span class="gemarra-regular">scraps of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fabric </span>reduce the dimensions of the window? After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are fit for </span>patching <span class="gemarra-regular">a tea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a garment. </span>The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to thick </span>scraps, which are unsuitable for patching. The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for a bloodletter </span>to wipe up the blood at the point of incision. The Gemara answers: It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to sackcloth, </span>which scratches the skin, and would not be used for that purpose.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to sackcloth, </span>why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> state <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is not three by three </span>fingerbreadths? It <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not four by four </span>handbreadths. Rough woven material of the kind used for sacks rather than clothes is susceptible to impurity only if its area measures at least four by four handbreadths. The Gemara answers: It is not actual sackcloth; rather, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sackcloth, </span>i.e., it is stiff, and will therefore not be used by a bloodletter, but is woven like regular clothing.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a limb or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh dangling from an animal or a beast </span>reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara asks: According to the opinion of Shmuel, why should this be so? After all, the animal can <span class="gemarra-regular">arise and escape, </span>and therefore it should not be considered as part of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>in place.
The Gemara challenges: But the owner of the animal will take it and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it. </span>The Gemara answers: It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">non-kosher </span>and will not be slaughtered. The Gemara challenges: Even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>will take it and <span class="gemarra-regular">sell it to a gentile. </span>The Gemara responds: It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a lean </span>animal, which no one will buy. The Gemara continues: Even if the animal does not move, there is a use for the part that is dangling, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">cut it off</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">throw it to the dogs. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is suffering to an anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> if he cuts it off, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will not do </span>that.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bird resting in the window </span>reduces its dimensions. The Gemara challenges: But it will <span class="gemarra-regular">fly away, </span>and therefore it should not be considered as part of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a bird <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is tied </span>in place. The Gemara further challenges: But the owner will take it and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it. </span>The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a non-kosher bird, </span>which he will not slaughter. The Gemara continues: Even if it is non-kosher <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>will take it and <span class="gemarra-regular">sell it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile. </span>The Gemara responds: It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelanita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of bird that is so bony that no one would purchase it to consume it.
The Gemara asks: But even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">give it to a child </span>to play with, so why does it reduce the dimensions of the window? The Gemara answers: It is referring to a bird <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scratches. </span>The Gemara challenges: But <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelanita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not scratch. </span>The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a type of bird that is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelanita</span> in that it is bony, but is inclined to scratch people.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a gentile sitting in the window </span>reduces its dimensions. The Gemara asks: But the gentile will <span class="gemarra-regular">arise and leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so why does he reduce the dimensions of the window? The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tied </span>in place. The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">release him. </span>The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a leper, </span>whom people are afraid to touch. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Another leper will come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">release him. Rather, </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a prisoner of the monarchy. </span>Since he is confined as a punishment, others are afraid to release him.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a child <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>months of pregnancy <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed in the window </span>reduces its dimensions. The Gemara challenges: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother will come and remove him </span>from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, </span>when it is prohibited to move this child, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A child <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>months <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a stone </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to move him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but his mother may bend over </span>the child <span class="gemarra-regular">and nurse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, due to the dange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that failure to nurse will cause her to fall ill.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Salt </span>reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is fit </span>for use and people will remove it from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to bitter </span>salt, which is not used as a seasoning. The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit for </span>tanning <span class="gemarra-regular">hides. </span>The Gemara responds: It is referring to salt <span class="gemarra-regular">that has thorns </span>mixed with it, and therefore it will not be used for tanning.
The Gemara challenges: Even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>this salt <span class="gemarra-regular">is damaging to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wall, he will remove it </span>from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it sits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a shard </span>of earthenware, and consequently it does not damage the wall. The Gemara states: If it is resting on earthenware, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shard itself serve as a barrier</span> against the spreading of the impurity. Why, then, is the salt mentioned? 

Daf 20b

The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the shard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>the sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">measur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for ritual impurity, and is therefore considered insignificant. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 82a): One who carries a shard of <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware </span>on Shabbat is liable only if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent </span>in size to that which is used <span class="gemarra-regular">to place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between one pillar and another </span>when they are piled on the ground, to strengthen the pillars.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">An earthenware </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessel </span>reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: But it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for one </span>to use; therefore, it is likely to be removed from the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">is dirty. </span>The Gemara challenges: Even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a bloodletter </span>to collect the blood. It would not matter to him if the earthenware were dirty. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perforated </span>and therefore unfit for that use.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah scroll </span>reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: But it <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit for reading; </span>therefore, it might be removed. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">that is worn out </span>and unfit for reading. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to place the Torah scroll in <span class="gemarra-regular">a repository </span>for unusable sacred books; therefore, he will certainly remove it to be stored away. The Gemara answers: This is referring to one who determines that <span class="gemarra-regular">its repository will be there. </span>In other words, it was placed in the window with the intent of storing it there in its worn-out state.
§ With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> referring to salt, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One can construct a barrier </span>to delineate a private domain on Shabbat or to block the spreading of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">with anythin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fat, </span>as salt crumbles and fat melts in the heat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: Even salt </span>can be used as a barrier. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: And they do not disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling of Shmuel is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Sodomite salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is like stone and can be used as a barrier, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling of Rav is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">isterokanit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is taken from the sea and is composed of grains.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> now that Rabba said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person makes two piles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of salt </span>at the opening to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">and places</span> a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam on top of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the salt supports the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam and the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> supports the salt </span>by weighing it down and compressing it, he can use this beam to render it permitted to carry in the alleyway on Shabbat, one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">isterokanit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> salt </span>can be used as a barrier. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> even so, Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree: This </span>ruling of Shmuel is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is</span> a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>to weigh the salt down, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> ruling of Rava is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must distance a mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> from a neighbor’s wall by a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lower stone </span>of the mill, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the upper stone </span>of the mill. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that one must distance a mill from the property of his neighbor? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the vibrations </span>it causes. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the measure for distancing a mill <span class="gemarra-regular">on a bas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lower millstone [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’isterobil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakelet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where the wheat is fed in? But <span class="gemarra-regular">there, what vibrations are there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason for the distancing is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nois</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> generated by the mill.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there must be a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>protruding <span class="gemarra-regular">base </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oven </span>until the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>narrow <span class="gemarra-regular">upper rim</span> of the oven. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the base of an oven </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth </span>wider than its rim. The practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>of this observation is with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to buying and selling, </span>i.e., a buyer should know that this is the proper ratio for the dimensions of an oven.
mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not set </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inside a house unless there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> space four cubits high above it, </span>i.e., between the top of the oven and the ceiling, to avoid burning the ceiling, which serves as the floor of the residence above. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was setting up </span>an oven <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper story, there must be a plaster floor beneath it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which serves as the ceiling of the lower story, at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>thick, so that the ceiling below does not burn. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a stove </span>the plaster floor must be at least one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> thick.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage </span>in any case, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>compensation for that <span class="gemarra-regular">which he damaged. Rabbi Shimon says: They said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all of these measurements </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">only that if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage he is exempt from paying, </span>as he took all reasonable precautions.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a baker</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a dye shop beneath the storeroom of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>establish <span class="gemarra-regular">a cattle barn </span>there, as these produce heat, smoke, and odors, which rise and damage the items in the storeroom. The mishna comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> truth, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a storeroom of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>the Sages rendered it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to set up a bakery and a dye shop beneath, as the heat that rises does not damage the wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>render it permitted to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">a cattle barn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because its odor damages the wine.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oven </span>the plaster floor must be <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths thick, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to a stove </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">three? </span>By contrast, the mishna says that the plaster floor beneath and oven and a stove must be three handbreadths and one handbreadth thick, respectively. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>ovens and stoves <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bakers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since they bake all day long, their implements get very hot. The <span class="gemarra-regular">oven </span>discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">in our </span>mishna is similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">a baker’s stove, </span>which is why in both cases a distance of three handbreadths is required.
The mishna teaches that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not open a bakery </span>or a dye shop beneath the storeroom of another, and he may not establish a cattle barn there. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: If the cattle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barn precede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the storeroom it is permitted, </span>i.e., the barn owner is not required to move it. With regard to this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raises a dilemma: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he cleaned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sprinkle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the area, i.e., he prepared it for use <span class="gemarra-regular">as a storeroom </span>but he has not yet filled it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it considered a storeroom already, and therefore others may no longer put a cattle barn beneath it, or perhaps the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that as long as it is empty he cannot prevent others from establishing a cattle barn?
Similarly, if he <span class="gemarra-regular">added window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for ventilation, which demonstrates his intention to use it as a storeroom, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Likewise, if he establishes <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosed veranda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the storeroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he <span class="gemarra-regular">built an upper roo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on top of his house </span>for storage, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? None of these questions are answered, and the Gemara declares that they <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. The Gemara cites a similar question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma: </span>If he placed <span class="gemarra-regular">dates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and pomegranate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> there, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this considered the start of its use as a storeroom or not? No answer was found to this question either, and the Gemara declares: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teiku</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">in truth, it is permitted</span> in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine </span>but not in the case of a cattle barn. The Gemara states that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: They permitted </span>it in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the heat and the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">improve </span>the wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit one to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">a cattle barn, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>a barn <span class="gemarra-regular">creates a bad odor. Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">of ours </span>spoils quickly, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">even the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">smoke of a candle also damages it. Rav Sheshet said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And alfalfa [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’aspasta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered like a cattle barn </span>in this regard, because it rots over time and creates a foul odor.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a resident wants to open <span class="gemarra-regular">a store</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can protest </span>to prevent <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>from doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unable to sleep due to the sound of people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enterin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the store <span class="gemarra-regular">and the sound of people exiting. But </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may fashion utensils </span>in his house and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and sell </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the market, </span>despite the fact that he is not allowed to set up a store in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot protest </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: I am unable to sleep </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sound of the hammer </span>you use to fashion utensils, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>can he say: I cannot sleep <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the sound of the mill </span>that you use to grind, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>can he say: I cannot sleep <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sound of the children. </span>It is permitted for one to make reasonable use of his own home.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, which states that one can prevent his neighbor from opening a store in the courtyard because the noise keeps him awake, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>which states that one cannot protest when his neighbor performs labor that is noisy? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause we arrive at </span>the case of one who operates in <span class="gemarra-regular">another courtyard, </span>i.e., one cannot prevent activity in a separate courtyard that is connected to the alleyway in which he lives. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, let it teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a different courtyard it is permitted. </span>Why does the mishna not specify that it is referring to a different courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>

Daf 21a

In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause we arrive at </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">schoolchildre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who come to learn Torah in his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> this ruling applies <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ordinance of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua ben Gamla and onward.</span>
What was this ordinance? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Truly, that man is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remembered for the good, and his name is Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If not for him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah would have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> been forgotten from the Jewish people. Initially, whoever had a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father </span>would have his father <span class="gemarra-regular">teach him Torah, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not have a father would not learn Torah </span>at all. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">did they interpret homiletically</span> that allowed them to conduct themselves in this manner? They interpreted the verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">otam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to your sons” (Deuteronomy 11:19), to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you yourselves [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall teach, </span>i.e., you fathers shall teach your sons.
When the Sages saw that not everyone was capable of teaching their children and Torah study was declining, <span class="gemarra-regular">they instituted </span>an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">that teachers of children should be established in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">did they interpret homiletically </span>that enabled them to do this? They interpreted the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For Torah emerges from Zion” </span>(Isaiah 2:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">But still</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whoever had a father, </span>his father <span class="gemarra-regular">ascended with him </span>to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">and had him taught, but whoever did not have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a father, he did not ascend and learn. </span>Therefore, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>teachers of children <span class="gemarra-regular">should be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established </span>in one city <span class="gemarra-regular">in each and every region [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pelekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And they brought </span>the students <span class="gemarra-regular">in at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">age</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixtee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">age </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">seventeen.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as the students were old and had not yet had any formal education, a student <span class="gemarra-regular">whose teacher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grew angry at him </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">rebel against him and leave. </span>It was impossible to hold the youths there against their will. This state of affairs continued <span class="gemarra-regular">until Yehoshua ben Gamla </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came and instituted </span>an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">that teachers of children should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be establishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in each and every province and in each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and every town, and they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> to learn <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">age </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">age </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">seven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to the matter at hand, since this system was established for the masses, the neighbors cannot prevent a scholar from teaching Torah in the courtyard.
Concerning that same issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, </span>a teacher of children: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not accept </span>a student <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the age of <span class="gemarra-regular">six, </span>as he is too young, and it is difficult for him to learn in a steady manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">From this</span> point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, accept him and stuff him </span>with Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ox. And Rav </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Shmuel bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheilat: When you strike a chil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for educational purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">hit him only with the strap of a sandal, </span>which is small and does not cause pain. Rav further advised him: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who reads, </span>let him <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>on his own; <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever does not read, let him be a companion to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his friends</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which will encourage him to learn to read.
With regard to a courtyard, the Gemara concluded that it is permitted for one to establish an elementary school to teach Torah and the neighbors cannot protest. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">member of a courtyard who wishes to become a doctor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bloodletter, a weaver </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vegardi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a teacher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of children, the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">members of the courtyard can prevent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>from doing so. This indicates that neighbors can protest the teaching of children in their shared courtyard. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here, </span>i.e., when can they protest his teaching children? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as there is no mitzva to educate them. In this situation, the neighbors can protest about the noise.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two people who are residing in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one of them sought to become a doctor, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bloodletter, a weaver, or a teacher of children, the other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can prevent him </span>from doing so. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile children.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house in a jointly owned courtyard may not rent i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a doctor, nor to a bloodletter, nor to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> weaver, nor to a Jewish teacher [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sofer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile teacher. </span>This indicates that one’s neighbors can prevent him from teaching Jewish children. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the scribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sofer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who does not teach children but writes documents and letters for residents of the town. This type of work is not a mitzva, and since many people seek his services, the residents of the courtyard can prevent him from performing this job near their houses.
§ With regard to the ordinance of Yehoshua ben Gamla, and concerning teaching children in general, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: From </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ordinance of Yehoshua ben Gamla, </span>that schoolteachers must be established in each town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and onward, one does not bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a chil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one town to another. </span>Rather, each child is educated where he resides. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one does bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them from one synagogue </span>where they learn <span class="gemarra-regular">to another synagogue. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if a river separates </span>the areas <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the children across, lest they fall into the river. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is a bridge </span>spanning the river <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may bring </span>them across the river. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a narrow bridge </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gamla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not bring </span>them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>The maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">number </span>of students for one <span class="gemarra-regular">teache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of children </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-five children. And if there are fifty </span>children in a single place, <span class="gemarra-regular">one establishes two </span>teachers, so that each one teaches twenty-five students. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are fort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> children, <span class="gemarra-regular">one establishes an assistant, and </span>the teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">receives help </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the town </span>to pay the salary of the assistant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a teacher of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children who teaches </span>a few subjects, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches more </span>subjects <span class="gemarra-regular">than him, one does not remove </span>the first teacher from his position to hire the second, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the other teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">will come to be negligen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> due to the lack of competition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi from Neharde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’a said: </span>On the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>is it the case that he will <span class="gemarra-regular">teac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">better </span>manner if he knows that he is the sole instructor in the place, as <span class="gemarra-regular">jealousy among teachers increases wisdom. </span>The one who was dismissed will try to refine his skills so that he will be rehired, and this will prevent negligence on the part of the other teacher.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two teachers of children, one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a lot of material <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not precise </span>in his statements, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is precise but does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>a lot of material, <span class="gemarra-regular">one hires the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a lot of material <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not precise. </span>Why is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Errors will be corrected by themselves, </span>and no lasting harm will be caused. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a said: One hires </span>the instructor <span class="gemarra-regular">who is precis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and does not teach </span>a lot of material, <span class="gemarra-regular">as once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an error is taught, it is taught, </span>and cannot be easily corrected.
The Gemara cites a proof for the opinion of Rav Dimi of Neharde’a: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For Joab and all Israel remained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there six months until he had cut off every male</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Edom” </span>(I Kings 11:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">came before </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">David </span>after this episode, David <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 21b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you did that? </span>Why did you kill only the males? Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: You shall blot out the males [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zakhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Amalek, </span>i.e., the male descendants of Amalek, who descend from Edom. David <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But we read </span>the verse as stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall blot out the remembrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zekher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of Amalek” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:19). Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I was taught to read it as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zakhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">went and asked his </span>childhood Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">teacher. </span>Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: How did you read </span>this word <span class="gemarra-regular">to us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I read it as <span class="gemarra-italic">zekher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The teacher had read it the proper way, but he failed to notice that his student had learned it incorrectly.
Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">took a sword to kill him. </span>The teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Why </span>do you want to kill me? Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who does the work of the Lord with a slack</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hand” </span>(Jeremiah 48:10), and you taught me incorrectly. The teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Leave that man to remain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as cursed. </span>This is a sufficient punishment; there is no need to kill me. Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And cursed is he who keeps back his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sword from blood” </span>(Jeremiah 48:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span> that Joab <span class="gemarra-regular">killed him, and there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not kill him. </span>In any event, this episode demonstrates that an error learned in one’s childhood stays with him his whole life.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a teacher of children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a professional <span class="gemarra-regular">tree planter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a butcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bloodletter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a town scribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">are considered forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In other words, they need not be exhorted to perform their jobs correctly, as if they err in the performance of their duties they can be dismissed immediately. The <span class="gemarra-regular">principle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the matter </span>is: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where loss is irreversible, </span>the individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain resident of an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who set up a mill </span>in the alleyway and earned his living grinding grain for people. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">another resident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the alleyway came and set up </span>a mill <span class="gemarra-regular">next</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his. The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is that </span>the first one <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prevent him </span>from doing so if he wishes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he</span> can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood </span>by taking my customers.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports his </span>opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance fish traps from fish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., from other fish traps, <span class="gemarra-regular">as far as the fish travels, </span>i.e., the distance from which the fish will travel. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is this distance? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Huna says: Up to a parasang [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parsa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>This indicates that one must distance himself from the place where another has established his business. The Gemara responds that this is no proof: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">fish are different, as they look </span><span class="gemarra-regular">around</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One fish explores the area ahead of the others, indicating to them where to go. Once they encounter the first trap they will not approach the second.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rava: Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna spoke in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 60a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A storekeeper may not hand out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">toasted grain and nut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to children </span>who patronize his store, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">accustoms them to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come to him </span>at the expense of competing storekeepers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis permit </span>doing so. This indicates that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, all forms of competition are prohibited, which would include the scenario concerning the mill.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda only there, as </span>the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>his competitor: If <span class="gemarra-regular">I distribute walnuts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">distribute almonds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shiyuskei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But here, </span>with regard to a resident of an alleyway who sets up a mill in that alleyway where another mill already exists, <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis concede that </span>the owner of the first mill can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood, </span>as beforehand whoever required grinding came to me, and you have provided them with another option.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A man may establish a shop</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alongside the shop of another, and a bathhouse alongside the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bathhouse of another, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot protest, because </span>the newcomer <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: You operate in your </span>space, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I operate in my </span>space.
The Gemara answers: This entire matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway can compel one anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to agree <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to allow among the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in that alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">a tailor, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a tanner, a teacher of children, nor any type of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">craftsman. </span>They can bar outside craftsmen from plying their trade in that alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one cannot compel his neighbor, </span>i.e., one who already lives in the alleyway, to refrain from practicing a particular occupation there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One can <span class="gemarra-regular">even compel his neighbor </span>not to conduct such work in the alleyway. Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehoshua, says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resident of </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">town can prevent a resident of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> town </span>from establishing a similar business in the locale of the first individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he pays the ta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>first town, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot prevent him </span>from doing business there, as he too is considered a resident of the town. <span class="gemarra-regular">The resident of an alleyway cannot prevent a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resident of his alleyway </span>from practicing a particular trade there, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and contrary to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
With these conclusions in mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a resident of </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway </span>protesting about <span class="gemarra-regular">a resident of another alleywa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> conducting business there, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And Rav Huna, </span>who said that a resident of an alleyway can prevent another from setting up an additional mill, <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes with regard to those who teach childre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot prevent </span>him from working, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Master said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ezra institute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">for the Jewish people </span>requiring <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they establish </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">teacher alongside </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">teacher, </span>to raise the standard of teaching.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us be concerned lest </span>the teachers <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">come to be negligent. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the Sage who raised this objection: 

Daf 22a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Jealousy among teachers increases wisdom.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said: And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>who said that townspeople can bar craftsmen who come from other cities, <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes with regard to </span>perfume <span class="gemarra-regular">salesmen who travel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">town </span>to another <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the townspeople <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prevent </span>them from entering their town. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Master said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ezra instituted </span>an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">for the Jewish people that </span>perfume <span class="gemarra-regular">salesmen shall travel from town to town so that cosmetics </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will be available to Jewish women. </span>Since this ordinance was instituted on behalf of Jewish women, the Sages ruled that these peddlers could not be barred from entering a town.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies only to one who seeks <span class="gemarra-regular">to travel </span>from town to town as a salesman. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he wants <span class="gemarra-regular">to establish </span>a shop, this ruling was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated, and the townspeople can prevent him from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he is a Torah schola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even establish </span>a shop as a perfume salesman. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>incident in <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rava permitted Rabbi Yoshiya and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ovadya to establish </span>a shop <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is the reason </span>for this ruling? The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are rabbis, they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">likely to be distracted from their studies </span>should they be required to travel from place to place.
§ The Gemara relates: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">these basket seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who brought baskets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Babylonia. The townspeople came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">prevented them </span>from selling there. The two parties <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Ravina </span>for a ruling. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>The basket sellers <span class="gemarra-regular">came from outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they sell to </span>those from <span class="gemarra-regular">outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the town, i.e., to guests who are not residents of the town. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">on a market day, </span>when people from other towns come to shop, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>they may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sell their wares <span class="gemarra-regular">on non-market days. And even with regard to market</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days, we say </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to selling in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the market, but </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to circulating</span> around the town.
The Gemara further relates: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">these wool sellers who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought wool to </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pum Nahara. The townsfolk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">prevented them </span>from selling it. The two parties <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Kahana </span>for a ruling. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is that they may prevent you</span> from selling your wares. The wool sellers <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: We have debts </span>to collect in the city, and we must sell our wares in the meantime to sustain ourselves until we are paid. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sell the amount </span>needed <span class="gemarra-regular">to sustain yourselves until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you have collected your debts, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">leave.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi of Neharde’a brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs on a ship </span>to sell them. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Exilarch </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rava: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see; if he is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah scholar, reserve the market for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., declare that he has the exclusive right to sell dried figs. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">smell his jar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., determine whether or not Rav Dimi is a Torah scholar.
Rav Adda bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>Rav Dimi a question: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an elephant that swallowe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wicker baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excreted it </span>intact along <span class="gemarra-regular">with its waste, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the vessel still susceptible to ritual impurity or is it considered digested and not susceptible to impurity? An answer <span class="gemarra-regular">was not available to </span>Rav Dimi. Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Adda bar Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the Master Rava, </span>i.e., are you Rava, as you have asked me such a difficult question? Rav Adda bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">struck him on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his shoe </span>in a disparaging way and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There is a great </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between me and Rava; but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I am perforce your teacher, and Rava is your teacher’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s teacher.</span>
Based on this exchange, Rav Adda bar Abba decided that Rav Dimi was not a great Torah scholar, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reserve the market for him, and </span>Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">lost his dried figs, </span>as they rotted. Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yosef </span>to complain, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">see what they did to me. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: He Who did not delay </span>retribution for <span class="gemarra-regular">the humiliation of the King of Edom should not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">delay </span>His response to <span class="gemarra-regular">your humiliation, </span>but should punish whoever distressed you, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “So says the Lord: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For three transgressions of Moab, indeed for four I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not reverse for him, because he burned the bones of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the King of Edom into lime” </span>(Amos 2:1).
The Gemara reports that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba died. Rav Yosef said: I punished him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I am to blame for his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cursed him. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said: I punished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, as he caused my loss of dried figs. Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I punished him, </span>i.e., he was punished on my account because he did not exhibit the proper respect for me. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>Rav Adda bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages: Instead of gnawing the bones in the school of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye, you </span>would do <span class="gemarra-regular">better </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat fatty meat in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the school of Rava, </span>i.e., it is preferable to study with Rava than with Abaye. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> punished him, as when he would go to the butcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to buy a piece of meat, he would say to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the butchers: I will take meat before Rava’s servant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as I am greater than he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> punished him, </span>i.e., he was punished because of me, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was the head of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span> lectures, the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak would teach the students immediately following the lesson taught by the head of the academy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Every day, before he went in for the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span> lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">he reviewed his lecture with Rav Adda bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and then he would enter </span>the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span> lecture.
On <span class="gemarra-regular">that day Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, seized Rav Adda bar Abba, because they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had not been present at the conclusion </span>of Rava’s lecture. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Tell us how Rava stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of animal tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Adda bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Rava said this and Rava said that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Meanwhile, it grew late for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Adda bar Abba </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to Rav Naḥman bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak: Arise </span>and teach us, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is late for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us. Why does the Master sit </span>and wait? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I am sitting and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">waiting for the bier of Rav Adda bar Abba, </span>who has presumably died. <span class="gemarra-regular">Meanwhile, a rumor emerged that Rav Adda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Abba had </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">died. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, it is reasonable </span>to conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak punished him, </span>i.e., he died as a result of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement, as the unfortunate event occurred just as he announced that Rav Adda bar Abba’s bier was on its way.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One whose wall was close to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of another may not </span>build <span class="gemarra-regular">another wall close </span>to the neighbor’s wall <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he distances it four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the wall of the neighbor. And one who desires to build a wall opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">the windows </span>of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from the windows, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span><span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">below, or opposite.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: Before addressing the construction of the second wall, one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">how did he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place </span>his wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s wall in the first place? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>

Daf 22b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One who comes to place </span>a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to his neighbor’s wall <span class="gemarra-regular">may place </span>that wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the neighbor’s wall <span class="gemarra-regular">only if he distances </span>his wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits from the existing wall. </span>Accordingly, the mishna is discussing one constructing a wall close to his neighbor’s wall the first time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: One whose wall was near the wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which indicates that there had already been a wall there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whose wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was near the wall of anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at a distance of four cubits and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fell, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not place another wall close </span>to his neighbor’s wall <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he distances </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is the reason </span>that this distance must be observed? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that walking here benefits there, </span>i.e., the ground is strengthened by people walking on the land in the area between the walls.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>that one must leave a space of four cubits between his wall and that of his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if he builds it alongside <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>his neighbor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where people do not usually walk due to the seeds. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall of a courtyard, </span>where people walk, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes to place </span>his wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both the wall of a garden and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall of a courtyard, if one comes to place </span>his wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not place </span>his wall <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>by.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: And </span>the two <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree, </span>as they are referring to different cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>statement of Rav is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">old city, </span>whose ground is well trodden and stable, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement of Rabbi Oshaya is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a new </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>where even the wall of a courtyard requires walking on its adjacent ground to strengthen it.
With regard to the claim that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna is due to the need for space for people to walk on the ground between the walls, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: And one who desires to build a wall opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">the windows </span>of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from the windows, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or opposite. And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to thi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> ruling: Concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>the wall must be high <span class="gemarra-regular">enough so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one cannot peer </span>into the window <span class="gemarra-regular">and see </span>into the window; concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>the wall must be low <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>on top of it <span class="gemarra-regular">and see </span>into the window; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>concerning the requirement of a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one must distance the wall from the windows <span class="gemarra-regular">so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it will not darken </span>his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window.
The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that distance is required opposite the window is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not darken </span>his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>will strengthen the ground. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>We are dealing with a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">that is positioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., perpendicular to the wall with the window in it, and therefore it blocks the light from entering the house through the window but does not prevent walking along the length of the neighbor’s wall.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how fa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> must one distance his wall if it is perpendicular to the other wall? <span class="gemarra-regular">Yeiva, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father-in-law of Ashyan bar Nidbakh, says in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of Rav: </span>As much <span class="gemarra-regular">as the full width of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why is this sufficient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Can’t he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">peer int</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> the window if he is that close? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: </span>This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who slopes his wall, </span>i.e., he fashions an incline on the upper surface of the wall so that he will not be able to stand on top of it and look through the window.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that one must keep the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>away from the window? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; here, </span>he builds the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side </span>of the window, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the mishna, he builds walls <span class="gemarra-regular">on two side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the window. In the latter case, if he builds the walls any closer he will block the light from entering the house through the window even if they are perpendicular.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a further difficulty from the mishna below with regard to the claim that the requisite gap between the walls is for the purpose of walking, as the mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one must distance his <span class="gemarra-regular">wall four cubits from a roof gutter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can lean a ladder </span>in the empty space to clean and repair the gutter. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>this distance is required is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that he will be able to lean <span class="gemarra-regular">a ladder, but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>will strengthen the ground. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sloping roof gutter, </span>which protrudes beyond the boundary of the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the reason for distancing the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to walking, one can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walk back and forth beneath it. </span>Nevertheless, a distance of four cubits from the roof gutter is required so that repairs can be performed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits from </span>a neighbor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecote so that a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mongoos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">jump </span>from the ladder to the dovecote and devour the birds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one must distance his <span class="gemarra-regular">wall four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits from a roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gutter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can lean</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ladde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r </span>in the empty space to clean and repair the gutter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that the mishna is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei, doesn’t </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>with regard to planting a tree next to a neighbor’s cistern: <span class="gemarra-regular">This one digs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">within his </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one plants within his </span>land, and neither individual need consider what is happening in the property of the other?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Ashi say: When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we were </span>studying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the study hall of Rav Kahana, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he would say </span>to us that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei concedes with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to his arrows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he concedes that one must distance himself if his actions will cause damage to his neighbor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, sometimes when he places </span>the ladder, the mongoose might be <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting in a hole and </span>will immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">jump </span>up and climb the ladder to the dovecote. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But that is indirect </span>damage, as he is not the immediate cause. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tovi bar Mattana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: That is to say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to cause even <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">certain small palm trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">talei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and

Daf 23a

<span class="gemarra-regular">bloodletters </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">come and sit beneath them </span>and perform their work there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and crows </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">come, eat the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood, and fly up to the palm trees and damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the dates. Rav Yosef said to </span>the bloodletters: <span class="gemarra-regular">Remove </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these crowing </span>birds <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>i.e., leave in order to avoid further damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an indirect </span>action, as the bloodletters themselves are not damaging the dates. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tovi bar Mattana said </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to cause even <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect damage.</span>
Abaye said to Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">But they have established an acquired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">privilege </span>to use that particular spot for their work. Rav Yosef replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avuh says: There is no acquired privilege </span>of use <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., an established situation may not be allowed to continue in the event that damage results. Abaye inquired further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to that </span>statement of Rav Naḥman that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>it is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to smoke, and Rav Zevid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a bathroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In other words, this principle was stated specifically in the context of damage caused by these substances. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For me, as I am sensitive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">smoke and a bathroom to me, </span>which is why I have the right to demand that the bloodletters leave.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to prevent doves from eating seeds in the town. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a person should not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dovecote within his own </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he has fifty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits in each direction </span>between the dovecote and the edge of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that one must have surrounding the dovecote the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> of seed on each side, which generally extends <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">far as a dove flies </span>in a single flight. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one bought </span>the dovecote with the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the acquired privilege </span>of its use <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>it has surrounding it only the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>around it, and he need not remove it from there.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Must one distance a dovecote only <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits </span>from the city <span class="gemarra-regular">and no more? </span>Is that as far as one can expect a dove to fly? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 79b): One <span class="gemarra-regular">may spread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out traps [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neshavin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for doves only if </span>this was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">at a distance of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ris</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or four <span class="it-text">mil</span>, which is eight thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">settled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to avoid catching birds that belong to another. Apparently, doves fly a distance of thirty <span class="it-text">ris</span>, whereas the mishna here states fifty cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Doves do <span class="gemarra-regular">fly great distances, </span>which is why one must avoid catching others’ birds by keeping traps thirty <span class="it-text">ris</span> away from settled areas. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as they eat along their way, <span class="gemarra-regular">their stomachs are filled </span>after a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits, </span>at which point they will do no more damage to seeds. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do they fly</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ris</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and no more? But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in a settled area, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not spread out </span>a trap <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the area under his control extends as far as <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span> in each direction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says: </span>That <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a settled area of vineyards, </span>i.e., a contiguous region of vineyards and gardens. In that case the doves pass from place to place even over a great distance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">settled area of dovecotes, </span>i.e., where many dovecotes are distributed. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that one may not establish a new dovecote there <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecotes themselves, </span>as he will trap doves belonging to others. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wish, say </span>that this is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>dovecotes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>it is referring to the dovecotes of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose property one is not obligated to protect from harm. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say</span> it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to ownerless </span>dovecotes.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that one must have surrounding the dovecote the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of seed on each side, which is as far as a dove flies in a single flight. And if one bought the dovecote with the land, he has the acquired privilege of its use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zevid: That is to say </span>that a court <span class="gemarra-regular">issues a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> claim </span>on behalf <span class="gemarra-regular">of a buyer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and issues a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> claim </span>on behalf <span class="gemarra-regular">of an heir. </span>This is referring to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of taking possession. If one has been physically in possession of an item for a period of time, generally three years, this serves as proof that he is in fact the legal owner. This possession must be accompanied by a claim of how one acquired the item; he cannot simply state that no one protested his possessing the item for three years. Rav Pappa is saying that the court will lodge a claim on behalf of a buyer or heir that they acquired the item from someone who was the owner, just as here the court assumes that the previous owner of the dovecote came to an agreement with his neighbors that he may use it.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary for Rav Pappa to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>this with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heir </span>(41a): In the case of land <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as an inheritance, one is not required to make a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>as to how the land came into his benefactor’s possession when one’s ownership of the land is challenged. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary for him </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer. </span>The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer as well, we learn</span> this in a mishna (60a): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">bought a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard in which there are projections and balconies [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ugzuztraot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> extending into the public domain, this courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">retains its presumptive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">status, </span>i.e., the owner has the acquired privilege of their use, and the court does not demand their removal.
The Gemara answers: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if he had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught us this </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in that mishna, one might have said that it applies specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a protrusion or a balcony that extends into <span class="gemarra-regular">the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain, as </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case where the seller had <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn back into his own </span>land before adding the projections and balconies, and they in fact do not extend into the public thoroughfare. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">the public waived </span>their right <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>and allowed him to place them over the common area, as otherwise they would have protested. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>where he causes damage to private individuals, one might have thought that the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have a privilege of use, and therefore the mishna teaches us otherwise.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he had taught this </span>only in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the party potentially suffering damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an individual, </span>the owner of the dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased </span>his neighbor by paying him to permit him to construct it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the neighbor might have <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>his right <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case where damage is caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public, </span>one might argue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whom did he appease</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who yielded </span>to him? Consequently, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the purchaser does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>retain the privilege of use. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case as well.
§ The mishna teaches that if one bought the dovecote with the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has the acquired privilege </span>of use. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: There is no acquired privilege </span>of use <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage? </span>Why should he retain his acquired privilege of use when his doves cause damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said: </span>Rav Naḥman’s statement is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to smoke, </span>which causes serious damage, and that is why it overrides an acquired privilege. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a bathroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>whose odor is particularly strong. 

Daf 23b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a dove <span class="gemarra-regular">chick [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nippul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was foun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within fifty cubits </span>of a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">it belongs to the owner of the dovecote. </span>If it was found <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond fifty cubits </span>from a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to its finder. </span>In a case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found between two dovecotes, </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">close to this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of this dovecote; if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">close to that one, </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of that dovecote. If it was <span class="gemarra-regular">half and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half, </span>i.e., equidistant from the two dovecotes, <span class="gemarra-regular">the two </span>owners <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the value of the chick.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>When resolving an uncertainty with regard to the halakhic status of an item, e.g., a found item, if the status of the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority </span>of like items indicates that it has one status <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the item in question is <span class="gemarra-regular">proximat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to a source that indicates otherwise, one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">majority</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">majority </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of proximity </span>also applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, even so the majority is preferable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira raises an objection </span>from the Torah’s statement with regard to a murder victim where the identity of the murderer is unknown. In a case of this kind, the court measures the distances between the corpse and the nearby towns, in order to determine which town is closest and must consequently perform the rite of the heifer whose neck is broken. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it shall be, that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the city that is nearest to the slain man, </span>the Elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd…and shall break the heifer’s neck” (Deuteronomy 21:3–4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this town is chosen <span class="gemarra-regular">even though there </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">be another </span>town <span class="gemarra-regular">that is large</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in population <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>According to Rabbi Ḥanina, in a case of this kind one should follow the majority.
The Gemara answers: This verse is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>other town that is larger than that one. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>still, if one follows the majority, why should the court follow the closest city? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us follow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the majority of the world, </span>as most people are found elsewhere. The Gemara answers: This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the city <span class="gemarra-regular">sits </span>in isolation <span class="gemarra-regular">between mountains, </span>and therefore it is unlikely that the murderer arrived from elsewhere.
The Gemara continues to discuss the issue of majority as opposed to proximity. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: With regard to a dove <span class="gemarra-regular">chick that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was found within fifty cubits </span>of a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">it belongs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the dovecote. And </span>as the mishna does not make a distinction between different cases, it indicates that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though there is another</span> dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">that is larger than </span>the proximate one in terms of number of birds. This shows that closeness, not majority, is the determining factor. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no </span>other dovecote in the area.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the mishna: If it was found <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond fifty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>from a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">it belongs to its finder. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is no </span>other dovecote in the area, it <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly fell from that </span>dovecote. How, then, can it be given to the finder? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a chick that <span class="gemarra-regular">hop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from place to place but does not yet fly. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>creature <span class="gemarra-regular">that hops, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hop more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> cubits. Consequently, any bird found within fifty cubits of a dovecote is assumed to have come from there. If it is farther away than that, it likely came from elsewhere or was dropped by travelers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yirmeya raises a dilemma: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one leg </span>of the chick was <span class="gemarra-regular">within fifty cubits </span>of the dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one leg</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond fifty cubits, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was for </span>his question about <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>far-fetched scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">that they removed Rabbi Yirmeya from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he was apparently wasting the Sages’ time.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the mishna: In a case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">was found between two dovecotes, </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">close to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this one, </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of this dovecote; if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">close to that one, </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the owner of that dovecote. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though one of them is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater </span>in number of birds <span class="gemarra-regular">than the other one. </span>Apparently, one rules based on proximity, not majority. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the two </span>dovecotes <span class="gemarra-regular">are equal </span>in size. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even so, why should one follow the closer dovecote? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us follow the majority of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the world, </span>as there are many other dovecotes besides these, and the number of doves they contain is greater. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>

Daf 24a

We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a path</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>passes between <span class="gemarra-regular">vineyards, </span>and these two dovecotes are situated there. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if it is so that </span>you claim the chick <span class="gemarra-regular">came from </span>anywhere else in <span class="gemarra-regular">the world, since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">hops, it could not have come </span>there. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that any </span>bird <span class="gemarra-regular">that hops and turns </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sees its nest </span>will continue <span class="gemarra-regular">to hop; but if it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>see its nest because it has gone too far, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will not hop </span>farther. Consequently, this found chick that hops must have come from one of these two dovecotes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: We learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 17b) <span class="gemarra-regular">as well </span>that one follows the majority rather than proximity: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">blood that is found in the corridor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baperozdor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the cervical canal, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uncertain </span>whether or not it is menstrual blood, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>as menstrual blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>came <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the uterus, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> source </span>of menstrual blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though there is an upper chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which empties into the canal, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is closer.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Abaye, in response to this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">You state </span>a proof from a case where the factors of <span class="gemarra-regular">majority and frequenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> are both present. When there is <span class="gemarra-regular">majority and frequency, there is no one who says</span> that one ignores the majority and follows proximity. Here, not only is the blood from the uterus greater in quantity, it also passes through the canal more frequently, as blood generally does not come from the upper chamber.
Rava cites a proof for his statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Blood that is found in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corridor </span>is considered definite menstrual blood, and therefore if she engages in sexual intercourse, both she and her partner would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable as a result of i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to receive <span class="it-text">karet</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for entering the Temple </span>intentionally when ritually impure or to bring an offering for entering unwittingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one burns </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to it, </span>if the woman touches such produce. Evidently, the status of this blood is not considered uncertain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Learn from </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>conclusions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>his statement that when the relevant factors are <span class="gemarra-regular">majority and proximity, follow the majority; and learn from </span>his statement that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one follows <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is burned in this case on account of the blood and she is liable to receive <span class="it-text">karet</span> if she enters the Temple in this state; <span class="gemarra-regular">and learn from </span>his statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a source <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Zeira </span>said.
This statement of Rabbi Zeira was issued in reference to a case discussed in tractate <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> (15a). If there are ten stores in a city, nine of which sell kosher meat and one of which sells non-kosher meat, and one found meat outside the stores and he does not know from which store it came, one follows the majority. The Gemara there suggests that perhaps one follows the majority only in a case where the gates of the city are unlocked, when the meat could have come to the city from the majority of kosher meat outside in a circumstance where the majority of the meat sold in the surrounding area was kosher. In this case there are two majorities, the majority of kosher meat stores inside the city, and the majority from outside. The Gemara there explains <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the city gates are locke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> one follows the majority, and the meat is kosher, as there is a no need for a double majority.
The Gemara elaborates: The two cases are analogous, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the woman </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered like the locked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gates of the city, </span>i.e., there is only a single majority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even so we follow the majority.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rava is the one who says</span> with regard to the case of the blood that when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">majority and frequency, there is no </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that one ignores the majority and follows the proximity. In other words, Rava rejected this case as proof of the principle that one follows the majority even when it is not frequent. Here, by contrast, Rava claims that one can learn from the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya that one follows the majority by Torah law. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> retracted that </span>claim in favor of the opinion that one follows the majority in all cases.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrel </span>of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>was found <span class="gemarra-regular">floating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a river</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the status of the wine was unknown, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>If it was <span class="gemarra-regular">found opposite a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">town of which the majority </span>of residents <span class="gemarra-regular">are Jews, </span>the wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as it can be assumed that the wine belongs to a Jew. If it was <span class="gemarra-regular">found opposite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a town of which the majority are gentiles, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>as it presumably belongs to a gentile. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: It is forbidden even </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">found opposite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a town of which the majority are Jews. </span>Why? Regardless of where it was found, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came from that </span>place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Dekira, </span>where the majority of people are gentiles. In other words, there is a distinct possibility that a floating barrel came from far away.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say that </span>Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>and he rules based on the majority, which in this case includes even distant locales, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>which is why he rules based on proximity.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; everyone agrees</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, and here they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about this: As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is so, that </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">came from that </span>place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Dekira, </span>this cannot be, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the currents and bays </span>of the river, where the river flow is weak, <span class="gemarra-regular">would have sunk it. </span>Therefore, it is logical that the barrel came from a nearby town. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">the force of the river caught </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">and brought it, </span>as it is evident that the flow of a river can bring items from far away.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted a certain barrel of wine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was found </span>hidden <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vineyard </span>where there were <span class="gemarra-italic">orl</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> grapes, and he was not concerned that the wine might be from the grapes of that vineyard. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he holds</span> in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina </span>that one follows the majority of vineyards, which are not <span class="it-text">orla</span>, rather than proximity?
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, as, if </span>thieves <span class="gemarra-regular">had stolen </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that very vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not have hidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the barrel was hidden there, it is reasonable to assume that it was stolen from somewhere else. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter, </span>that thieves would not hide a stolen barrel in the same vineyard from which they stole it, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to wine; but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">hide grapes </span>there, as grapes are not readily identifiable by the owner. Consequently, there is a concern that grapes found hidden there might be from that same vineyard.
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there were these jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were found between vines [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei kofa’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of a Jew. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>deemed the contents <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>and was unconcerned that they might be wine owned by a gentile. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>who says that one follows the majority, in this case gentiles? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There it is different, as the majority</span>

Daf 24b

<span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who pour wine </span>from barrels into jugs <span class="gemarra-regular">are Jews</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore it is reasonable that the wine belongs to a Jew. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to large </span>jugs. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if they were <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>jugs, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they were dropped by travelers, </span>most of whom are gentiles, and therefore the jugs of wine are forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are large </span>jugs <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the found jugs, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that they all belong to Jews, as travelers do not usually carry large jugs; it can be assumed that the small ones <span class="gemarra-regular">were placed to balance </span>the donkey’s load, and the jugs all fell together.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-five cubits from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">of a carob</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and of a sycamore </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which have a great many branches, they must be distanced <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul says: Every barren </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> must be distanced <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits. And if the city preceded </span>the tree, as one later planted the tree alongside the city, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down</span> the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give money </span>to the tree’s owner in compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> preceded </span>the city, which expanded after one planted the tree until it reached the tree, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">gives money </span>to its owner. If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain whether this one was first or that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was first, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give money.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that one must distance a tree from a city? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the beauty of the city, </span>as it is unattractive for a city’s walls to be obscured by tree branches. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him derive </span>this <span class="it-text">halakh</span><span class="it-text">a</span> from the statement in tractate <span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> (33b) <span class="gemarra-regular">that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may neither convert a field </span>of a city into <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> surrounding the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor may one </span>convert <span class="gemarra-regular">an open area </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, </span>as these have fixed places and measurements (see Numbers 35:1–8). If one plants trees in a city’s open area, he thereby turns the open area into a field.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to supply the reason given by Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, who says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">may convert a field </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">an open area, and an open area </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field. Here, we do not </span>plant trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beauty of the city.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis as well, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not convert a field </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">an open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area, nor </span>convert <span class="gemarra-regular">an open area </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, </span>one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>applies only to <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, </span>i.e., one may not plant seeds in a city’s open area and thereby turn it into a field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">trees, we do </span>plant them in an open area. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>plant trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the beauty of the city.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say, </span>i.e., on what basis do you maintain, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difference between seeds and trees? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> whose area is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was enclosed </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is permitted to carry within it on Shabbat regardless of its size, as it is considered a private domain.
If subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part of it was sown </span>with seed crops, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a garden, </span>which is not a place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is prohibited </span>to carry anything within it on Shabbat. If <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was planted </span>with trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a place of dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>to carry there on Shabbat. This shows that planting trees in an enclosure does not transform the area into a field, as is the case when seeds are planted.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the city preceded </span>the tree he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give money. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different with regard to a cistern, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of another mishna (25b) <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that if one plants a tree next to a neighbor’s existing cistern, the owner of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">gives money; and what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different here that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the owner of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give money?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>citing a popular aphorism: <span class="gemarra-regular">A pot belonging to partner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is neither hot nor cold, </span>i.e., no one takes responsibility for an item that belongs to several people, as opposed to a single individual. Here too, there is no specific person who will pay for the tree.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty </span>to begin with? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to public </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from damage</span> caused to the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of an individual. </span>Consequently, when one’s tree causes damage to the public he is not compensated for having to cut it down, whereas he does receive payment when his tree damages a private cistern.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if Rav Kahana’s </span>comment <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in this context, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated about the latter clause: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If the tree preceded </span>the city, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">gives money </span>to its owner. Concerning this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the tree owner <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the city residents: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me money first and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then I will cut down </span>the tree. In this context, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: A pot belonging to partners is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">neither hot nor cold. </span>If the owner of the tree is entitled to wait until he had first collects money, a good deal of time would pass before the tree would be cut down. Therefore, a community need not collect money and pay immediately, unlike an individual.
§ The mishna teaches that if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain whether this one was first or that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one was first, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give money. </span>The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>that of a tree alongside <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which you said </span>in the mishna (25b) that in a case of uncertainty the owner of the tree need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut down </span>the tree?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>if it were a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of certaint</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the tree would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to being cut </span><span class="gemarra-regular">down; </span>therefore, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of uncertainty too, we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say to </span>the owner of the tree: <span class="gemarra-regular">Cut </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">down. </span>In that case, if the tree preceded the cistern, the owner of the tree would not be required to cut it down. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>if it were a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certainty, </span>the tree would be <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to being cut down</span> even if it preceded the city, and the only uncertainty is whether or not the owner of the tree would need to be compensated. Consequently, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, we say to </span>the owner of the tree: <span class="gemarra-regular">Cut </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">down. And if </span>the owner of the tree lodges a claim <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the tree, as he wants compensation for it, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bring proof </span>that your tree came first, <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>your money. Since he has no proof, he does not receive any money.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a permanent threshing</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">floo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits from the city, </span>so that the chaff will not harm the city’s residents. Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person should not establish a permanent threshing floor </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he has fifty cubits </span>of open space <span class="gemarra-regular">in every direction. And one must distance </span>a threshing floor <span class="gemarra-regular">from the plantings of another and from </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed field </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">enough that it does not cause damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause </span>of the mishna, which states a fixed measurement for the distance of a threshing floor from a city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>which does not provide a measurement but simply states in general terms: Enough that it does not cause damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause we arrive at </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> threshing floor that is not permanent. </span>This threshing floor must be far enough from a neighbor that it does not cause damage to his property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">threshing floor that is not permanent? Rabbi Yosei, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, says: </span>It refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>threshing floor <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one processes such a small quantity of grain that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not winno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a winnowing shovel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but employs some other method that does not scatter the chaff as far. This is one resolution of the contradiction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that the phrase: Enough that it does not cause damage, is not referring to a distance but provides an explanation. In other words, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: What is the reason </span>for the ruling of the first clause, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must distance a permanent threshing floor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fifty cubits from the city? </span>It must be far <span class="gemarra-regular">enough</span> away <span class="gemarra-regular">that it does not cause damage.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against the opinion of Abaye from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the city; and just as one distances </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits from the city, so too does one distance </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits from the gourds, cucumbers, plantings, and plowed field</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another, enough that it does not cause damage. Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi, </span>as he claims that in both clauses the same distance is required: One must move a threshing floor fifty cubits from a plowed field and from those plantings. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span> The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara asks with regard to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>one must distance his threshing floor <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>neighbor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">cucumbers and gourds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the chaff </span>from the threshing floor <span class="gemarra-regular">goes </span>and penetrates <span class="gemarra-regular">into the heart </span>of the flower <span class="gemarra-regular">and dries it out. But why </span>must one distance the threshing floor <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed field? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Zutra: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span>

Daf 25a

<span class="gemarra-regular">he turns it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">manure, </span>i.e., the chaff acts like manure, and an excessive amount of manure damages the seeds.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">carcasses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and graves, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tannery [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">haburseki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a place where hides are processed, <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits from the city. One may establish a tannery</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only on the east </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because winds usually blow from the west and the foul smells would therefore be blown away from the residential area. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: One may establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">on any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of a city <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the west, </span>as the winds blowing from that direction will bring the odors into the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one must distance </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits </span>from the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance from vegetables water in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which flax is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">steeped</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because this water ruins them; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise one must distance <span class="gemarra-regular">leeks from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">onions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mustard from bees. And Rabbi Yosei permits </span>one not to do so in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of mustard.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is Rabbi Akiva speaking? </span>Did he mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">on any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side </span>of a city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one may even <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the west </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">one must establish it at a distance of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits? Or perhaps </span>he meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">on any side and distance it fifty cubits, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">except for the west side, </span>where one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">at all.</span>
The Gemara cites a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">on any side </span>of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">and distance it fifty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits, except for the west side, </span>where one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>a tannery <span class="gemarra-regular">at all, because </span>the western wind is <span class="gemarra-regular">frequent.</span>
§ With regard to the last statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">frequent </span>mean in this context? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">frequent among the winds, </span>i.e., this wind blows all the time, that is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanan bar Abba say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Four winds blow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every day </span>from different directions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the northern wind </span>blows <span class="gemarra-regular">with each of </span>the other three; <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were not so, </span>i.e., if it did not blow, <span class="gemarra-regular">the world would not exist for even one hour, </span>as the northern wind is pleasant and tempers the bitter effects of the other winds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the southern win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">harsher than all of them, and were it not </span>for the angel named <span class="gemarra-italic">Ben</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Netz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">stops it </span>from blowing even harder, it would <span class="gemarra-regular">destroy the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">world, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Does the hawk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">netz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] soar by your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?” </span>(Job 39:26). This indicates that the northern wind is the most constant, not the western wind.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">frequent? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">frequent with the Divine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Presence, </span>i.e., the Divine Presence is found on the western side, and therefore it is inappropriate to set up a tannery there with its foul odors. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Levi says: Come and let us be grateful to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our ancestors who revealed </span>to us <span class="gemarra-regular">the place of prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “And the hosts of heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bow down to You” </span>(Nehemiah 9:6). Since the celestial bodies move from east to west, they bow in that direction, which indicates that the Divine Presence is in the west.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this: But perhaps </span>the celestial bodies are <span class="gemarra-regular">like a servant who receives a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his master and walks backward </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">bowing. </span>If so, the Divine Presence is in the east and the celestial bodies are moving backward. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>i.e., the verse does not provide a definitive proof.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Oshaya holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence </span>is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every place, as Rabbi Oshaya says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “You are the Lord, even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You alone, You have made heaven…</span>You preserve them all alive and the hosts of heaven bow down to You” (Nehemiah 9:6)? This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Your messengers are not like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the messengers of flesh and blood. The messengers of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh and blood return to the place from where they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were sent </span>to report on <span class="gemarra-regular">their mission. But Your messengers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> return </span>and report on <span class="gemarra-regular">their mission from the </span>very same <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">which they are sent, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated “Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out and say to you: Here we are?” </span>(Job 38:35). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">does not state: They will come and say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., they do not return to their point of departure, <span class="gemarra-regular">but: “They may go out and say,” </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the Divine Presence </span>is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in every place.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, too, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in every place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>one of the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yishmael taught: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Divine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in every place? As it is stated: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> behold the angel who spoke with me went forth, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another angel went out to meet him” </span>(Zechariah 2:7). Although both angels were coming from the Divine Presence, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">does not state: After him, but: “To meet him,” </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the Divine Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in every place, </span>and therefore the angels depart for their missions from every place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet, too, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in every </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place, as Rav Sheshet said to his servant: Set me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> facing any direction </span>to pray <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the east. </span>Rav Sheshet, who was blind, required the assistance of his aide to prepare for prayer. He explained to his servant: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the reason I do not wish to face east is <span class="gemarra-regular">not because it does not contain the Divine Presence, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because the heretics instruct </span>people to pray <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>direction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Abbahu says: The Divine Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the west, as Rabbi Abbahu says: What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">oriyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a name for the west? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the air of God [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Yah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., this is the place of the Divine Presence.
The Gemara cites a statement connected to the four winds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doctrine shall drop as the rain, </span>my speech shall distill as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender growth, and as the showers upon the herb” (Deuteronomy 32:2)? “My doctrine shall drop [<span class="it-text">ya’aro</span><span class="it-text">f </span>] as the rain”; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the western wind, which comes from the back</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’orpo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the west is also referred to as the back.
<span class="gemarra-regular">“My speech shall distill [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tizzal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the dew”; this is the northern wind, which </span>brings dry air that reduces the rain and grain and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">devalues [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mazzelet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] gold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When grain crops are reduced their price appreciates, and consequently the value of gold decreases. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">addition, it says: “You who lavish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hazzalim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] gold out of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bag” </span>(Isaiah 46:6).
<span class="gemarra-regular">“As the small rain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kisirim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tender growth”; this is the eastern wind that rages through [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maseret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the entire world like a demon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sa’ir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>when it blows strongly. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And as the showers upon the herb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; this is the southern wind, which raises showers and causes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> herbs to grow.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">world</span>

Daf 25b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to </span>a partially enclosed <span class="gemarra-regular">veranda [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’akhsadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> enclosed on three sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the northern side </span>of the world <span class="gemarra-regular">is not enclosed </span>with a partition like the other directions. The sun begins its revolution in the east and passes to the south and the west, <span class="gemarra-regular">and once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sun reaches the northwestern corner it turns around and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascends </span>throughout the night <span class="gemarra-regular">above the sky </span>to the east side and does not pass the north side. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua says: The world is similar to a small tent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lek</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ubba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the north side is enclosed </span>with a partition as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">but once the sun reaches the northwestern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corner </span>it emerges from this small tent, and <span class="gemarra-regular">circles and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">passes behind the dome, </span>i.e., outside the northern partition, until it reaches the east.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: </span>“The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place, where it rises again. <span class="gemarra-regular">It goes toward the south</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and turns</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about to the north; </span>round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:5–6). The verse is understood as describing the sun’s movements, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It goes toward the south” during the day,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “and turns about to the north,” </span>on the outside of the firmament, <span class="gemarra-regular">at night. “Round and round goes the wind</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ruaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and the wind returns again to its circuits”; </span>as the word <span class="it-text">ruaḥ</span> can also mean direction or side, Rabbi Yehoshua explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are the face of the east</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the face of the west. Sometimes, </span>in the short winter days, the sun <span class="gemarra-regular">turns about them </span>without being seen, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sometimes, </span>in the long summer days, <span class="gemarra-regular">it traverses them</span> visibly.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">would say: </span>With this <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>that the world is like a partially enclosed veranda. He cites a verse as proof that the north side is open: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Out of the chamber comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the storm”; this is the southern sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that forms a room with the other two sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And cold out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the dispersed parts” </span>(Job 37:9); <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the northern</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side, </span>which is open, and from which a cold wind comes. <span class="gemarra-regular">“By the breath of God ice is given”; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is the western side. “And the breadth of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">waters is straitened” </span>(Job 37:10); <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the eastern side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from which the rains come.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t the Master say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the southern wind raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> showers and causes herbs to grow? </span>The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">rain that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> falls gently, </span>which waters plants and brings growth; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a downpour </span>of rain that causes damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Out of the north comes gold” </span>(Job 37:22)? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the northern wind, which devalues gold </span>by causing a drought that raises the price of grain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, in addition, it says: “You who lavish gold out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the bag” </span>(Isaiah 46:6).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple was destroyed the southern wind has not brought rain, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the description of the destruction of the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He decrees on the right and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is hunger, and consumes on the left and they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not satisfied” </span>(Isaiah 9:19). This means that God decreed that the southern wind, which is called right, shall bring famine with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “North and right, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You have created them” </span>(Psalms 89:13). This proves that the term right means south.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rafram bar Pappa says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day the Temple was destroyed, the rains no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">descend from the good storehouse, as it is stated: “The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord will open to you His good storehouse, </span>the skies, to give the rain of your land in its season” (Deuteronomy 28:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">In a time when the Jewish people perform</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God’s will, and the Jewish people are settled in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their land, rain descends from the good storehouse. In a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time when the Jewish people are not settled in their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> land, rain does not descend from the good storehouse.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who wishes to become wise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should face south</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>one who wishes <span class="gemarra-regular">to become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthy should face north. And your mnemonic </span>for this is that in the Temple the <span class="gemarra-regular">Table, </span>which symbolized blessing and abundance, <span class="gemarra-regular">was in the north, and the Candelabrum, </span>which symbolized the light of wisdom, <span class="gemarra-regular">was in the sout</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should always face south, as once he becomes wise he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>subsequently also <span class="gemarra-regular">become wealthy, as it is stated </span>with regard to the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Length of days is in her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Proverbs 3:16).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence is in the west. </span>How, then, can one pray facing south? The Gemara explains <span class="gemarra-regular">that one should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">turn aside </span>slightly, so that he faces southwest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Ashi: </span>An individual <span class="gemarra-regular">such as you, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lives to the north of Eretz Yisrael, should face south </span>when you pray. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia is located to the nort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Eretz Yisrael? As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written </span>in a prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Out of the north evil </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land” </span>(Jeremiah 1:14).
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must distance from vegetables the water in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flax is steeped, </span>and distance mustard from bees. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei permits </span>one not to do so in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of mustard because he can say to</span> the beekeeper: <span class="gemarra-regular">Before you tell me: Distance your mustard from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my bees, </span>I can tell you: <span class="gemarra-regular">Distance your bees from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my mustard, as they come and eat my mustard plants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In other words, you are also causing damage to my property. Since they each cause damage to the other, neither can force his neighbor to move.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a tree twenty-five </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits from a cistern, and </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carob and of a sycamore tree, </span>whose roots extend farther, one must distance the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits. </span>This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the cistern or tree <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">above or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the side </span>of the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the digging of <span class="gemarra-regular">the cistern preceded </span>the tree, the owner of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">money. And if the tree preceded </span>the cistern the owner of the tree need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut down </span>the tree. If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain whether this came first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or that came first, </span>the owner of the tree need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut down </span>the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Even if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the cistern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the tree need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut down </span>the tree. This is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that this one digs in his own</span> property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one plants in his own </span>property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the mishna’s statement that a tree must be distanced if it is above a cistern. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether the cistern is below </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the tree is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether the cistern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is above and the tree is below. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern is below and the tree is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>it will cause damage, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the roots extend and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage the cistern </span>when they breach its walls. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the cistern is above and the tree is below, why</span> should he have to distance the tree, considering that the roots extend downward? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥagga says in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei: </span>He must distance the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its roots <span class="gemarra-regular">form holes in the ground and ruin the floor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the cistern.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the cistern preceded </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tree, </span>the owner of the tree need <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut </span><span class="gemarra-regular">down </span>the tree. This is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this one digs in his own </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plants in his own </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. Rav Ashi said: When we were </span>studying <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall of Rav Kahana, we would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one’s arrows, </span>i.e., one must distance his activities from his neighbor if his actions will cause immediate damage to his neighbor, even if he is acting on his own property.
The Gemara relates that a man called <span class="gemarra-regular">Pappei Yona’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a was poor and became wealthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He <span class="gemarra-regular">built a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mansion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">appadna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> on his land. <span class="gemarra-regular">There were these </span>sesame seed <span class="gemarra-regular">presser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his neighborhood who </span>would work, and <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they would press the sesame seeds </span>their activity <span class="gemarra-regular">would shake</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mansion. He came before Rav Ashi </span>to complain. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: When we were </span>studying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study hall of Rav Kahana, we would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei concedes with regard to one’s arrows. </span>Here too, because the sesame seed pressers cause immediate damage they must distance themselves.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>must the mansion shake for the owner to have the right to compel the sesame seed pressers to distance themselves? 

Daf 26a

It must shake enough <span class="gemarra-regular">that the lid [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nakhtema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">at the mouth of a jug shake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> if it is placed on a wall.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the</span> members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">household of bar Maryon, son of Ravin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, would beat </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">flax, the chaff [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would fly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> off and harm people. </span>Those people <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Ravina </span>to complain. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: When we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to his arrows, this statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the damaging item <span class="gemarra-regular">moves by his direct </span><span class="gemarra-regular">force. Here, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the wind that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carries </span>the chaff.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi objects to this: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">winnow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on Shabbat by throwing the grain into the wind so that the chaff is blown away <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wind assists him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> That is considered a primary category of labor on Shabbat despite the fact that the act is performed partly with the aid of the wind. The Gemara relates that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>this objection with regard to beating flax <span class="gemarra-regular">before Mareimar. </span>Mareimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who winnows and the wind assists him. </span>Just as this is considered his direct force for the purposes of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, it is likewise considered his direct force with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damages.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina, </span>who rejects this comparison and claims that flying chaff is not considered one’s arrow, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this situation <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a spark</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that flies from a hamme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and causes damage, </span>in which case all agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one wielding the hammer <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to pay? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable for him that </span>the spark <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>as far as possible, rather than staying nearby. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> preferable for him, </span>i.e., it is immaterial to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the chaff <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>some distance.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not plant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a tree near the field of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he distances</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it four cubits from </span>the field. This is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is planting <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevines or any </span>kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a fence between </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may place, </span>i.e., plant, his grapevines or trees <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the fence from here, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., plant, his produce <span class="gemarra-regular">close to the fence from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there.</span>
If the <span class="gemarra-regular">roots were spreadin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another, </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">may dig to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> depth </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>even if he severs those roots, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not impede </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">plow. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">was digging a cistern </span>in that spot, or <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ditch, or a cave, </span>and he came upon the roots of his neighbor’s tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may cut downward </span>normally, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wood </span>from the roots <span class="gemarra-regular">is his.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>one must leave between a vineyard and a neighbor’s field are <span class="gemarra-regular">for the work of the vineyard, </span>so that the owner of the vineyard does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while working his vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Eretz Yisrael, but in Babylonia two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are sufficient, as their plows are shorter. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not plant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree near the field of another unless he distances</span> the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits from </span>the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Four cubits?

<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who raise </span>this matter in the form <span class="gemarra-regular">of a contradiction.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> We learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plant a tree near the field of another unless he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distances it four cubits from </span>the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits </span>are sufficient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Babylonia, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eretz Yisrael.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Ḥanan had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these palm trees </span>that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to the boundary of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef’s vineyard. Birds would come and roost </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the palm trees and </span>would subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">descend to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard and damage it. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cut dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> your palm trees. Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I distanced </span>them the required amount. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter, </span>i.e., this specific distance, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but a greater </span>distance <span class="gemarra-regular">is required for vines</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan protested: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in the mishna that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is planting <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevines or any </span>kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">tree? </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This matter </span>applies only to the distance between one <span class="gemarra-regular">tree and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">tree, or </span>the distance between one <span class="gemarra-regular">vine and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">vines. But </span>with regard to the space between <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree and vines, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requires a greater distance.</span>
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not cut them down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this palm tree that produces one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of fruit, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to cut it down, </span>due to the verse: “You shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥanina says: My son Shikhḥat died only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because he cut down a fig tree before its time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the Master is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amenable </span>to do so, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut </span>them down, but I will not do it.
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Papp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had these palm trees </span>that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the boundary of </span>the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua. He went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">digging and cutting his roots. </span>Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is this? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna: If the <span class="gemarra-regular">roots were spreading into</span> the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">may dig to a depth </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>even if he severs those roots, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not impede </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">plow.</span>
Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: This statement </span>applies only up to <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, whereas the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master is digging </span>and cutting <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than three. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am </span>digging <span class="gemarra-regular">cisterns, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ditches, and caves, as we learned </span>in the mishna: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">was digging a cistern, a ditch, or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cave, he may cut downward </span>normally <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wood </span>from the roots <span class="gemarra-regular">is his. Rav Pappa said: I told</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him all </span>the proofs I could find, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unable to </span>convince <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>that I was correct, 

Daf 26b

<span class="gemarra-regular">until I told him that</span> which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a strip </span>of land over <span class="gemarra-regular">which the public has an acquired privilege </span>of use, one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not destroy it. </span>Here too, since I have an acquired privilege of use of this land, you are not permitted to destroy that which I possess. <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">left, </span>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Why did I not say to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an acquired privilege of use is effective when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">within sixteen cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as within that area the roots are considered part of the tree, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>I cut the roots of the palm trees <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond sixteen cubits.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he was digging </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern, a ditch, or a cave, he may cut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> downward and the wood is his. </span>The Sage<span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Hadeyyav raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: To whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does the wood belong? </span>The mishna says that the wood is his, without specifying to which of the two individuals this refers, the owner of the tree or the owner of the land.
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You learned </span>the answer in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Me’ila</span> (13b). If <span class="gemarra-regular">roots of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary person [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extend into </span>a field belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Temple </span>treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derive benefit </span>from them, but if one derived benefit from them he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. That is, even if one does transgress the prohibition and benefit from them, it is not considered misuse and he is not liable to bring an offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">follow the tree, </span>and the roots are considered part of it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse, </span>as the tree is not consecrated. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say we follow the land, </span>i.e., the roots belong to the land’s owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>will you say, that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the tree? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last clause </span>of that mishna: If roots of a tree belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Temple </span>treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">extend into </span>a field <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not derive benefit </span>from them, but if one derived benefit from them he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> follow the tree, why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse</span> of consecrated property?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are the cases comparable? </span>In both clauses of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with growths that came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thereafter, </span>i.e., after the tree was consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to growths</span> that grew from a consecrated plant or tree, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. Only the original plant is. Consequently, there is no connection between that mishna and the question of whether roots are considered part of the tree or part of the land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>in the first clause of the mishna in <span class="it-text">Me’ila</span>, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">within sixteen cubits </span>of the tree. In this case the roots are considered part of the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the second clause, it is referring to roots <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond sixteen cubits, </span>in which case the roots are considered part of the ground where they are found.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>An individual who maintains <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within sixteen cubits of a boundary is a robber, </span>as it draws nourishment from the neighbor’s land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not bring first fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since that would be a mitzva that is fulfilled by means of a transgression.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where does Ulla </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>measurement? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 1:6), this is problematic. That mishna teaches: If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">ten sapling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scattered in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one may plow the entire </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their </span>sake <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rosh HaShana </span>of the Sabbatical Year. Although it is prohibited to plow other land in the time leading into the Sabbatical Year, to avoid the appearance of preparing to work the ground in that year, it is permitted to do so for the purpose of sustaining these young trees.
The Gemara calculates: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is </span>the area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">2,500 </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And how much </span>area is allocated <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of the ten trees? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">250 </span>square cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">that Ulla</span> taught. An area of sixteen cubits to each side of the tree is a square of thirty-two by thirty-two cubits, or 1,024 square cubits, which is much larger than 250.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>Ulla derived this measurement <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 1:5): If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to three </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">people</span> in one <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">combine, and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may plow the entire</span>

Daf 27a

<span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for their </span>sake. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>is that area in cubits? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">2,500 </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits. And how much </span>area is that <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>of the trees? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">833⅓. This is still </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>the amount <span class="gemarra-regular">that Ulla </span>established. The Gemara answers: Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">was not precise </span>in this matter.
The Gemara asks: One can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that we say </span>that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">was not precise </span>in his measurements when his ruling leads <span class="gemarra-regular">to a stringency; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">do we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">was not precise </span>if his measurements lead <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leniency? </span>According to the previous explanation, Ulla exempts the owner of a tree from first fruits even in a case where his tree does not in fact draw nourishment from his neighbor’s field.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>the roots extend that far <span class="gemarra-regular">in a square, </span>i.e., one measures sixteen cubits to each side of the tree? Not so; <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a circle, </span>that is, the roots extend in a circle surrounding the tree, as the area of a circle is smaller than that of the square circumscribing it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">how much is </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a square greater than the </span>area of a <span class="gemarra-regular">circle </span>with a diameter the length of the side of that square? It is greater by <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the area of the circle. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">768 </span>square cubits, three-quarters of 1,024, <span class="gemarra-regular">remain </span>for each tree, but <span class="gemarra-regular">there still remains half a cubi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> more based on the mishna’s calculation. In other words, the measurement would be more accurate if a tree is considered to draw nourishment from a distance of sixteen and a half cubits on each side. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>why we said that Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">was not precise, and </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not precise</span> in a manner that leads <span class="gemarra-regular">to a stringency, </span>as one brings first fruits even from a tree that stands just sixteen cubits from the boundary, rather than 16½.
The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Ulla. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> 1:11): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who buys a tree and its lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites </span>the requisite Torah verses (Deuteronomy 26:5–11) over them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case where one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount </span>of land with the tree? The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>it is referring to a case where one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits </span>of land around the tree.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an additional proof from another mishna (<span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> 1:6): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">bought two tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not recite </span>the verses, because the land does not belong to him. It may be inferred from here that if he bought <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does brin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and recite </span>the verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>referring to a case where one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount </span>of land with the trees? The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; here too </span>it is referring to a case where he acquires <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits </span>of land around the trees.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva says: </span>The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">land of any </span>size <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in first fruits, and </span>a lender <span class="gemarra-regular">can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from abrogating an outstanding debt [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>this land, so that loans he provided will not be canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year, 

Daf 27b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and he can acquire property that does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not serve as a guarantee, </span>i.e., movable property, along <span class="gemarra-regular">with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> There are specific modes of acquisition for movable property, but if one is acquiring any amount of land at the same time as the movable property, the mode of acquisition employed to acquire the land suffices for the acquisition of the movable property as well. Apparently, any amount of land is subject to first fruits, whereas according to Ulla a tree acquired with less than sixteen cubits of land surrounding it draws nourishment from the land surrounding it and is exempt from first fruits. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat, </span>which is subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of first fruits and requires very little land to nourish it.
The Gemara comments that the language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it teaches: </span>Land <span class="gemarra-regular">of any</span> size, which indicates even a miniscule amount, and all normal trees certainly require more land than that. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that it is so.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 2:22): If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, part of which is in Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">and part </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of which is outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, it is considered as though <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., produce that is subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred produce, </span>i.e., produce that is exempt from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">are mixed together </span>in each one of this tree’s fruits. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to the fruits in the part of the tree that is <span class="gemarra-regular">growing in </span>a place where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an obligation </span>to separate tithes, i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to separate tithes. With regard to the fruits that are <span class="gemarra-regular">growing in </span>a place where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an exemption </span>from separating tithes, i.e., outside of Eretz Yisrael, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only in that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and therefore it is assumed that the nourishment drawn from Eretz Yisrael sustained the fruit that grew on that side of the tree, and the nourishment drawn from outside Eretz Yisrael sustained the fruit that grew there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and the fruit is considered mixed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">grew </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a place where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an exemption </span>from separating tithes, i.e., outside Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>even though the tree might have roots within sixteen cubits of Eretz Yisrael and draw nourishment from there. This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Ulla, as he claims that the place from where a tree draws its nourishment is decisive with regard to first fruits.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a rock</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divides </span>the roots up to the trunk, and therefore it is possible to distinguish between the parts of the tree that draw nutrients from Eretz Yisrael and the parts that draw nutrients from outside of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what is the reasoning of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? Why does he view the fruits as being a mixture? The Gemara answers: He holds that although there is a division between the roots, they cannot be distinguished from one another, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they then become mixed </span>in the body of the tree.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard to what</span> principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: The air </span>above the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">mixes </span>the nutrients, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: This</span> part of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone and this </span>part of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone. </span>From the roots up to the branches, it is as if the tree were cut along the line of the border.
The Gemara raises a difficulty against Ulla’s opinion from a different perspective: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> do roots extend <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits and no more? Didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in a mishna (25b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern? </span>This indicates that tree roots reach more than sixteen cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The roots <span class="gemarra-regular">extend farther, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">they weaken the ground only up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sixteen cubits; </span>with regard to an area any <span class="gemarra-regular">more</span> distant than that, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not weaken </span>the ground.
Concerning this matter the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">within sixteen cubits of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boundary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is a robber, and one does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring first fruits from it.</span>
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that is close to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a boundary and a tree that leans </span>into a neighbor’s yard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one brings </span>first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites </span>the verses, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was on this conditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Joshua apportioned Eretz</span> Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people, </span>i.e., that they would not be particular about such matters.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that leans into the field of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut </span>the branches <span class="gemarra-regular">to the height</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> raised <span class="gemarra-regular">over the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in places where the land is to be plowed, so that the branches do not impede the use of the plow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a carob tree and </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a sycamore </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose abundance of branches cast shade that is harmful to plants, all the branches overhanging one’s property may be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">along the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plumb </span><span class="gemarra-regular">line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., along a line perpendicular to the boundary separating the fields. And if the neighbor’s field is <span class="gemarra-regular">an irrigated field, all </span>branches of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tree </span>are removed <span class="gemarra-regular">along the plumb line. Abba Shaul says: All </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barren trees </span>are cut <span class="gemarra-regular">along the plumb line.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was raised before them: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul referring to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>of the mishna, which states that a tree extending into a neighbor’s field is cut only to the height of an ox goad, and Abba Shaul maintains that barren trees have the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as carob and sycamore trees in that they are cut along the plumb line? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to the latter clause, </span>which discusses an irrigated field, and he permits cutting only barren trees along the plumb line, but not fruit trees?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> irrigated field, Abba Shaul says: All </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">trees </span>are cut <span class="gemarra-regular">along the plumb line, because the shade is harmful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to an irrigated field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This shows that he does not dispute the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the latter clause. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is referring to the first claus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the mishna. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that it is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi said </span>that the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precise, as it teaches: All barren trees. Granted, if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that Abba Shaul <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the first clause </span>of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Abba Shaul <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: All </span>barren <span class="gemarra-regular">trees. But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the latter clause, he should have </span>said simply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Barren trees, </span>as the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> permits one to cut down any type of tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that it is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that extends into the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one cuts </span>its branches <span class="gemarra-regular">so that a camel can pass</span> beneath the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">with its rider </span>sitting on it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: </span>One cuts enough branches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel loaded</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with flax or bundles of branches </span>can pass beneath it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>One cuts <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>branches of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>extend into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">along the plumb line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so that they do not hang over the public area at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to ritual impurity.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to damage </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the current assessment, </span>and future damage is not taken into account? The mishna states that the tree’s branches are cut to the height of a camel and its rider or load but no more, despite the fact that they will certainly grow again.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish says: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught as a dispute, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned </span>in a mishna (60a): One <span class="gemarra-regular">may not make </span>an empty <span class="gemarra-regular">space beneath the public domain </span>by digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, ditches, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caves. Rabbi Eliezer permits </span>one to dig a pit if it is subsequently covered with material strong <span class="gemarra-regular">enough that a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wagon loaded with stones can travel on it </span>without it collapsing. If the cover can withstand such weight when the pit is dug, it is permitted, despite the fact that the cover might eventually rot.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna here represents the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who prohibit one from digging beneath the public domain under any circumstances. The difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">will occasionally deteriorate, and </span>as this matter is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his mind </span>it will cause damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>branch grows <span class="gemarra-regular">he cuts it off. </span>Since the potential cause of damage is visible, there is no concern that it might be neglected.
§ The mishna teaches that if the branches of a tree extend into the public domain, one may cut them to allow a camel and its rider to pass underneath; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>One cuts enough branches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel loaded with flax or bundles of branches </span>can pass beneath it. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s measure greater, or </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis’ measure greater? </span>Which reaches a greater height, a camel and rider or a camel loaded with flax?
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis’ measure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater, as, if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s measure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater, how would the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis act in </span>the circumstance of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s measure? </span>It is clear that a camel will have to pass beneath the tree with a burden, and it would not be able to do so. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>then would you say? That <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis’ measure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how would Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">act in </span>the circumstance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis’ measure? </span>It is also clear that a camel will have to pass there with its rider. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is possible for </span>the rider <span class="gemarra-regular">to bend over and to pass underneath </span>the branches.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>One cuts <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span> branches of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tree </span>that extend into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">along the plumb line, due to ritual impurity. </span>The Gemara explains: A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to ritual impurity </span>imparted in <span class="gemarra-regular">a tent. </span>Branches over a corpse might create a tent, thereby transferring impurity to whatever is beneath the branches, rendering impure those passing under the tree in the public domain. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to ritual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impurity. </span>How else could ritual impurity be transferred through branches other than by means of a tent?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mishna </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that the concern is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crow might bring </span>a source of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>and perch on the tree’s branches <span class="gemarra-regular">and throw it there. And </span>if that were the only concern, <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere scarecrow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bedaḥlulei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">would be sufficient </span>to frighten the crows away and prevent that type of impurity. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the concern is due to impurity imparted in a tent.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">pits; and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ditches; and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">caves, </span>which are used to collect water; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecotes; and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">bathhouses; and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">olive presses; and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">irrigated fields, </span>which must be watered by people; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves; and all </span>similar property <span class="gemarra-regular">that constantly, </span>i.e., throughout the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">generates profits, their presumptive ownership </span>is established by working and profiting from them for a duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">three years from day to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the one in possession of the property can prove that he worked and profited from it for the previous three full years, there is a presumption that it belongs to him, and would remain in his possession if another were to claim that the property belonged to him or to his ancestors.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-irrigated field, </span>i.e., one that is watered by rain, in which produce grows during certain seasons during the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">its presumption </span>of ownership is established in <span class="gemarra-regular">three years, but they are not from day to day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the fields are not worked and harvested continually throughout the three-year period.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months </span>of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first </span>year, <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>months of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the last </span>year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and twelve months </span>of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, which are eighteen months, </span>suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: A month </span>of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first </span>year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a month </span>of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the last year, and twelve months </span>of possession <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, which are fourteen months, </span>suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a white field [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bisdeh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lavan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a grain field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a field of trees, </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">he gathered his produce, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">harvested his olives, </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered his figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>three harvests <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>the equivalent of <span class="gemarra-regular">three years. </span>Since he harvested three types of produce, this is equivalent to having possessed the field for three years.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: I heard from those who travel to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ush</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> to study with the Sages there <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would say: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that presumptive ownership </span>is established in <span class="gemarra-regular">three years? From the forewarned ox: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox, once it has </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">gored three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gorings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it left </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive status of an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is established as </span>having the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive status of a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, once he has </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">three years, </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">left the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller, and it is established </span>as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer.</span>
The Gemara questions this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, say that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as with a forewarned ox, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable </span>to pay full damages <span class="gemarra-regular">until the fourth goring, here too, </span>the land should <span class="gemarra-regular">not be established </span>as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession until the fourth year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara rejects this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, once it has gored three </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forewarned, </span>

Daf 28b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the requirement for there to be <span class="gemarra-regular">another, </span>fourth, incident for the owner to be liable to pay full damages exists because <span class="gemarra-regular">before it gores </span>after having become a forewarned ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is there for the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay? Here, once he has </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">three years, </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">is established </span>as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>according to the explanation that the forewarned ox is the source for the presumption of ownership with regard to land, even <span class="gemarra-regular">possession that is not accompanied by a claim, </span>i.e., where the possessor has no explanation as to how he acquired it, <span class="gemarra-regular">should be </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, just as goring three times automatically establishes its having the status of a forewarned ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did we learn </span>in a mishna (41a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Any possession that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accompanied by a claim </span>explaining how the possessor became the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that possession that is not accompanied by a claim is not sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>in a standard case where one has presumptive ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">we sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that even if the claimant proves that the field was once his, since the other is in possession of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the truth is <span class="gemarra-regular">as he says, </span>that he purchased it from the previous owner. But <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">does not claim </span>that he purchased it, <span class="gemarra-regular">will we claim </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">for him?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avira objects to </span>the explanation that the presumption with regard to land is derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a forewarned ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, a protest that </span>the claimant lodges during the three years <span class="gemarra-regular">not in the presence </span>of the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest, </span>because it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of a forewarned ox: Just as we require </span>that the testimony concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>its owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too here, we </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also require </span>that a protest be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>possessor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence.</span>
The Gemara answers: This is not difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to a forewarned ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And warning has been given to its owner” </span>(Exodus 21:29), indicating that the warning must be issued in the presence of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>with regard to the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">your friend has a friend, and the friend of your friend has a friend, </span>so that the protest will become known even if lodged not in the presence of the possessor, as word of it will spread. There is no Torah edict mandating that the protest be lodged in his presence, and it is sufficient that he hears of it, even secondhand.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Meir, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>When the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">performs its gorings at intervals </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">performs its gorings successively, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>the case that its owner is liable? According to his opinion, the animal must gore only three times to become forewarned, and it is not required that the gorings occur on three separate days; they can all occur on the same day. Similarly, one could say that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he profited </span>from the field by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">three fruits </span>of, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, a fig </span>tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">within one day, that should be </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
The Gemara answers: This would not be a valid comparison, as presumptive ownership with regard to land must be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of a forewarned ox: Just as </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox, at the time when </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has this goring, it does not have that goring, </span>as each act of goring occurs at a separate time, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>in order for the consumption of the produce to establish the presumption of ownership, it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time when this fruit is here, that fruit is not here. </span>When all the produce of the field is extant concurrently, consumption of this produce does not establish the presumption of ownership, even if the produce is consumed at three different times.
The Gemara asks: Based on this, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he profited </span>from the field by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">three fruits within three </span>consecutive <span class="gemarra-regular">days, for example, </span>the fruits of <span class="gemarra-regular">a caper bush</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose fruits ripen day after day, <span class="gemarra-regular">that should be </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, as all three fruits were not ripe concurrently. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to the caper bush, <span class="gemarra-regular">at least the fruit is here and it is in the process of finishing </span>its ripening during the three days. This is not similar to the goring ox, where each goring is fully independent of the others.
The Gemara challenges: Based on this, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he profited </span>from the field by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">three fruits within thirty days, for example, alfalfa [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aspasta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which quickly regrows when cut, and which is repeatedly cut over a short period of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">that should be </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where it could regrow three times within thirty days? <span class="gemarra-regular">Where it grows a little </span>and he cuts <span class="gemarra-regular">and consumes it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where it grows a little </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">and he consumes it, </span>such that he cuts it three times within thirty days. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, he is seizing and consuming </span>the alfalfa, which is not the normal way of farming it, and consequently he does not establish the presumption of ownership, which is established only through standard use of the land.
The Gemara challenges: Based on this, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he profited </span>from the field by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">three fruits within three months, for example, alfalfa, </span>where he did employ the standard method of harvesting it, <span class="gemarra-regular">that should be </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">who travel to Usha </span>whose opinion is under discussion? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael. Indeed, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yishmael, </span>this would establish the presumption of ownership.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? With regard to a white field, </span>i.e., a grain field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a field of trees, </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">he gathered his produce, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">harvested his olives, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered his figs, these </span>three harvests <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>the equivalent of <span class="gemarra-regular">three years. </span>Rabbi Yishmael is of the opinion that three harvests are sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, </span>who hold that three years, and not three harvests, are required to establish the presumption of ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the source for the concept of this type of presumptive ownership?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>detailing the purchase of a field from Hanamel by Jeremiah, his cousin, during the time of the siege of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them” </span>(Jeremiah 32:44). This describes the writing of a bill of sale to serve as proof of ownership of the field, since he was unable to remain living there for three years to establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the prophet </span>Jeremiah <span class="gemarra-regular">stood in the tenth </span>year of King Zedekiah’s reign <span class="gemarra-regular">and warned </span>people to write bills of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for the eleventh </span>year, when Eretz Yisrael would be overrun. Consequently, despite the fact that one purchasing a field there would be able to live on the land for two years, this would not be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, which is why he said that they should have bills of sale written.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Perhaps there he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us good advice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that it is advisable to have documents to preclude the need to present witnesses that can attest that one had been living on the land. This is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in less than three years. 

Daf 29a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Because if you do not say so, </span>then when he states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them” </span>(Jeremiah 29:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>halakhic statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was he saying? Rather, he teaches us good advice, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">here too he teaches us good advice. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that this was mere advice, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days” </span>(Jeremiah 32:14). This is obviously good advice to preserve the items properly, and is not a halakhic statement. Therefore, this is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in under three years.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>who sees another profiting from his field might <span class="gemarra-regular">waive </span>his rights during <span class="gemarra-regular">the first year, </span>and he might <span class="gemarra-regular">waive </span>his rights for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he will not waive </span>his rights for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: If that is so, when </span>it becomes clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">the land </span>is in fact owned by another and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is returned </span>to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">it should be returned, save for the produce </span>that the possessor consumed during the first two years, as the owner waived his rights to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did Rav Naḥman say: The land is returned and the produce is returned?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person is not particula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first year </span>to lodge a protest, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not particular </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years, even though he does not waive his rights to the pro-duce. He <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>to lodge a protest when he sees another profiting from his field for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: If that is so, </span>for people <span class="gemarra-regular">such as those of the bar Elyashiv household</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are particular even with regard to one who goes on the boundary of their </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>will you say <span class="gemarra-regular">that presumptive ownership is </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, </span>as soon as one makes use of their property without their lodging a protest? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, you have subjected your statement to the </span>varying <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances </span>of each case, as there will be a different length of time needed to establish the presumption of ownership depending on who the prior owner is. This is untenable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person is carefu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his document </span>detailing his purchase of land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the first year </span>after the purchase, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">careful </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">two and three </span>years. For <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>time than that, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not carefu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and might discard the document if no one has lodged a protest concerning his possession of the land. Therefore, the Sages ruled that after three years have passed, he can prove his ownership by means of presumptive ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: If that is so, a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence should not be </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, </span>and if three years pass with no protest in his presence, presumptive ownership should be established even if there was a protest lodged before other people. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the one possessing the land can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you had protested in my presence, I would have been careful with my document </span>and would not have discarded it.
The Gemara explains that this claim would not be accepted, <span class="gemarra-regular">be-cause </span>the claimant can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Your friend has a friend</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and your friend’s friend has a friend, </span>and the assumption is that word of the protest reached you.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">three years that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> are required to establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">when he </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the field in <span class="gemarra-regular">consecutive </span>years. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>with this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>this in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Their presumption </span>of ownership is established by use for a duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">three years from day to day. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">From day to day, </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude partial </span>years and to teach that each of the three years must be full, <span class="gemarra-regular">and actually even scattered, </span>i.e., non-consecutive, years are sufficient, therefore, Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the years must be consecutive.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama says: And Rav Huna concedes with regard to locations where </span>they leave <span class="gemarra-regular">fields [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bagei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">lie fallo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> by planting in alternate years, that the three years combine despite not being consecutive, as that is the manner in which owners profit from the land.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this with regard to locations <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are </span>some people <span class="gemarra-regular">who leave </span>the fields to <span class="gemarra-regular">lie fallow and there are </span>some people <span class="gemarra-regular">who do not leave </span>the fields to <span class="gemarra-regular">lie fallow, and this man left </span>the field to <span class="gemarra-regular">lie fallow. Lest you say </span>that the claimant can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: If it is so that </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">is yours, you should have sown it, </span>therefore, Rav Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am not able to </span>hire someone to <span class="gemarra-regular">guard one </span>parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land within an entire field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and I acted like those who own other land in this location and let the field lie fallow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And alternatively, </span>the possessor can say to the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">In thi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> manner of farming it is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial for me </span>to farm, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">produces more </span>later, and I do not wish to plant year after year and weaken the soil.
The Gemara clarifies Rav Huna’s statement that the presumption of ownership can be established only by consecutive use. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna about the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership of houses. But </span>with regard to the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, where </span>the witnesses attesting to its use <span class="gemarra-regular">know </span>who uses the house only <span class="gemarra-regular">in the day, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not know </span>who uses the house <span class="gemarra-regular">in the night, </span>how then can one establish the presumption of ownership in the case of a house? The possessor’s use is not consecutive, as it is continually interrupted by the nights.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Who testifies about houses? Neighbors, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">neighbors kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> who is inside <span class="gemarra-regular">in the day and in the night.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that there is another scenario in which one can bring witnesses with regard to the use of a house. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">such as when two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come and say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> We rented </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">from hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we lived in it for three years, in the day and in the night. </span>This testimony substantiates that the house was used under the authority of the one who is attempting to prove that he has established the presumption of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: </span>How can their testimony be relied upon? <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are biased in their testimony</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because if they do not say this </span>testimony, that they rented the house from the possessor for three consecutive years, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say to them: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give payment for </span>the rental of <span class="gemarra-regular">the house to that </span>one who is claiming ownership, as the one you paid has not established that he is the true owner.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Low</span>-level <span class="gemarra-regular">judges rule this way. </span>In other words, only a court composed of ignorant judges would accept the testimony of the renters of the house in a case where they are biased in their testimony. Nevertheless, Rava’s scenario is still possible, as, <span class="gemarra-regular">are we not dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are holding </span>the money for the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for </span>the rental of <span class="gemarra-regular">the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they are saying </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">To whom shall we give it? </span>Therefore, they are not biased in their testimony, because they will pay the same amount, regardless of who the actual owner is.
The Gemara quotes a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">claims and says: Let two witnesses come to testify for </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">that he lived in </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">three years in the day and in the night, his claim is </span>a legitimate <span class="gemarra-regular">claim. </span>

Daf 29b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Mar Zutra concedes with regard to peddler</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who travel through cities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> during which time others might live in their houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">that even though </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">does not claim </span>that he insists on testimony that there was continuous use, day and night, over three years, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>Since people know they are traveling salesmen, it is more likely that people lived in their houses without permission and without their knowledge.
With regard to the requirement for continuous day and night use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna concede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to a store </span>in the town <span class="gemarra-regular">of Meḥoza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>is generally <span class="gemarra-regular">used in the day </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">used in the night, </span>that one is not required to use it in the night to establish the presumption of ownership.
With regard to the requirement of continuous use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama and Rav Ukva bar Ḥama purchased a maidservant together. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage made use of her </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">first, third, and fifth </span>years, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage made use of her </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">second, fourth, and sixth </span>years. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who contested </span>their ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the maidservant <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>and claimed that he was the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rava </span>for a judgment. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: What is the reason you acted like this, </span>making use of her in alternate years, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">you would not establish </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> concerning each other </span>by making use of her for three consecutive years? <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>this usage does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to others, </span>i.e., the claimant in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was not written </span>in a <span class="gemarra-regular">document </span>that they are partners and are dividing the use, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was written </span>in a <span class="gemarra-regular">document, </span>the document generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that they own the maidservant as partners rather than individually, and they can jointly establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the requirement for full use of land to establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited, </span>for three years, <span class="gemarra-regular">from all of </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which he did not use, <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquires all </span>of the field based on presumptive ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua, says: And we said </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>that <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">rova</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is suitable for planting, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not suitable for planting, he acquires it by means of </span>the acquisition of the rest of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye objects to this: If that is so, how could one acquire </span>an area that is only <span class="gemarra-regular">roc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> by establishing the presump-tion of ownership, as one does not plant rocky land? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the presumption of ownership can be established <span class="gemarra-regular">by standing animals on it or spreading produce on it. Here too, he should be require</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to stand animals on </span>the <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">rova</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">spread produce on it. </span>If he did not profit from this small piece of land at all, he has not established the presumption of ownership with regard to it, and acquires only the rest of the field.
§ The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want, </span>i.e., what are you doing, <span class="gemarra-regular">with this house </span>of mine? The other <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was among the distant settlements</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and was unaware that you were residing in my house, which is why I did not lodge a protest.
The one residing in the house <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>for a judgment. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go clarify your profiting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., prove that you really resided there for three years, and then the case can be judged. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this the </span>correct <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>Therefore, the one who is attempting to take the house from the possessor should have to prove that the other did not reside in the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman. As </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person

Daf 30a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: I </span>am hereby <span class="gemarra-regular">selling to you all </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that I own <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There was a certain </span>parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land that was called: Of the house of bar Sisin. </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>parcel of land that I own is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin, and it is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">called: Of the house of bar Sisin, </span>and it is not included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rav Naḥman </span>for judgment, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he established </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the buyer. Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Isn’t the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>and the land should remain in the possession of the seller?
The Gemara continues: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>from one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava to </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, </span>and there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>from one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman to </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman, </span>as in the first case, where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, Rav Naḥman ruled in favor of the claimant, and Rava ruled in favor of the possessor; while in the second case, that of the property of bar Sisin, their opinions were reversed.
The Gemara answers: The contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the property of bar Sisin, the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller </span>had been <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>as having the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in his property, </span>which is why Rava rules in his favor. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>as having the house <span class="gemarra-regular">in his property.</span>
The contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman and </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult as well, </span>because there, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I am hereby selling you all of the property that I own <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin, and </span>this parcel of land is <span class="gemarra-regular">called: Of the house of bar Sisin, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">incumbent on him to revea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the parcel under dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">not of the house of bar Sisin. But here, </span>in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, it <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>from a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the possessor is <span class="gemarra-regular">holding a document </span>as evidence that he purchased the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wouldn’t we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">ratify your document, and </span>only then be <span class="gemarra-regular">established in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property? </span>In this case as well, since his presumptive ownership is in place of a document, he needs to clarify the matter by means of witnesses.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to another: What do you want with this house </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I was in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer marketplaces</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and was unaware that you were residing in my house, and therefore did not lodge a protest, so your profiting does not establish the presumption of ownership. The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I have witnesses that every year you would come </span>here for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days</span> and had an opportunity to know that I was residing in your house and to lodge a protest. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was occupied with </span>my business in the <span class="gemarra-regular">marketplace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for those <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days. Rava said: A person is apt </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">occupied </span>with business <span class="gemarra-regular">in the marketplace for all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days, </span>and accepted his claim.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so, who told me that he purchased it from you. </span>The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Don’t you concede</span>

Daf 30b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that this land is </span>formerly <span class="gemarra-regular">mine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not purchase it from me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>away; <span class="gemarra-regular">I am not legally answerable to you. Rava said: </span>The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: So-and-so is a robber </span>who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you.
The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I have witnesses that I came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">consulted with you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and you said to me: Go purchase </span>the land, indicating that you conceded that he had the authority to sell it. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The reason that I advised you to purchase it was because <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>person, i.e., you, the possessor, <span class="gemarra-regular">is amenable to me, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, </span>i.e., the purported thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">is more difficult than he, </span>i.e., I prefer to litigate with you rather than with him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is Rava’s statement? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Admon? As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 109a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who contests </span>ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">of a field, </span>claiming that a field possessed by someone else actually belongs to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the claimant himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is signed as a witness on </span>the bill of sale of the field to that other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">Admon says: </span>His signature does not disprove his claim of ownership of the property, as it is possible that the claimant said to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">The second </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is amenable to me </span>to deal with, as I can reason with him, while <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>owner, who sold the field to the current possessor, <span class="gemarra-regular">is more difficult </span>to deal with <span class="gemarra-regular">than he. And the Rabbis say: He lost his righ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to contest, as he signed a bill of sale that states that the field belongs to the possessor. Rava’s ruling appears to be in accordance with the individual opinion of Admon, and not with the opinion of the Rabbis.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that Rava’s ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. There, </span>in the case of the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span>, by signing the bill of sale the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an action </span>indicating that the field was not his <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the benefit of the possessor of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, </span>in Rava’s case, there was no action, only <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is apt to casually say </span>statements, and he does not lose his right by virtue of this.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: So-and-so is a robber </span>who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you. The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I have witnesses that you came </span>to me <span class="gemarra-regular">at night and you said to me: Sell it to me,</span> indicating that it is not your land, as if it were yours, you would have demanded that I return it without your paying for it. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I said </span>to myself: Let me <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>the benefit of avoiding <span class="gemarra-regular">my litigation </span>in order to reclaim my land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A person is apt </span>to pay money <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purchase </span>the benefit of avoiding <span class="gemarra-regular">his litigation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, indicating that he possessed it for three years, as this is the minimum number of years required for establishing the presumption of ownership. The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I am holding a document </span>stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that I purchased it from </span>that seller <span class="gemarra-regular">four years </span>ago. Therefore, if it was sold to you three years ago, as you claim, he did not have the authority to sell it at that time.
The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you maintain</span> that when I said: I profited from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, that <span class="gemarra-regular">I was saying </span>I worked and profited from the land for precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">three years? </span>What <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying </span>was that I worked and profited from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">many years </span>and thereby established the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. Since my purchase predated yours, it was effective. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">people to refer to many years </span>as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, and his claim is accepted.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>years, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that presumptive </span>ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> of this </span>possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded the document</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of that </span>claimant. 

Daf 31a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he profited from the land for only <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>years, so that the sale to the claimant took place before the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership were completed, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">have no greater protes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than this, </span>that the purported seller then sold the land to another. By doing so he indicated that he does not concede that the possessor was the rightful owner, and the possessor should have been careful to hold on to his bill of sale for even longer than three years.
There was an incident where two people disputed the ownership of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to his ancestors, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses that </span>he currently possesses the land and that he worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The judgment is in favor of the possessor, due to the legal principle that if the judgment would have been decided in one’s favor had he advanced a certain claim, and he instead advanced a different claim that leads to the same ruling, he has credibility, as <span class="gemarra-regular">why would he lie </span>and state this claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted </span>to lie, he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, in which case he would have been awarded the land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not say </span>the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would I lie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> contradicting his current claim, as they testify that the land belonged to the ancestors of the claimant. Therefore, he should not be awarded the land.
The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">then said to </span>the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it is true that it had <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to your ancestors, but I purchased it from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>by stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that which I said to you: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors, </span>I merely meant <span class="gemarra-regular">that I rely upon </span>my ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>it belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to my ancestors, </span>as I purchased it and then profited from it for the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: Can he <span class="gemarra-regular">state a claim and return</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, </span>or can he <span class="gemarra-regular">not state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim? Ulla said: </span>He can <span class="gemarra-regular">state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim.</span>
The Gemara clarifies their respective opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla concedes </span>that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>had initially <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors and did not belong to your ancestors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim,</span> as Ulla allows the litigant only to reinterpret his initial claim, not to replace it with a contradictory claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Ulla also concedes that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he was standing in court and did not state </span>a particular <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, and </span>he later <span class="gemarra-regular">came in from outside </span>and back into the court <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot return and state </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">claim. What is the reason </span>for this? It is because it is apparent that these <span class="gemarra-regular">claims of his </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">taught to him </span>by someone after he left the court.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a concede </span>that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the litigant who changed his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other litigant that when he had initially claimed: The land belonged to my ancestors, he had actually meant: It <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors, who purchased it from your ancestors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that he can state a claim and <span class="gemarra-regular">return</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, </span>as this serves only to clarify, and not negate, his initial claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Sages of Neharde’a also concede that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">discussed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">matter outside </span>of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>state a particular <span class="gemarra-regular">claim,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court and stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, that </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">return and state </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">claim. What is the reason </span>for this? Because <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is apt not to reveal his claims except to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: I am </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a, but I </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">hold that </span>a litigant can <span class="gemarra-regular">state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim. </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that a litigant can <span class="gemarra-regular">state a claim and return and state </span>a modified version of his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
In an incident where two people dispute the ownership of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them. The first one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses that </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to his ancestors, and </span>that he worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>the second one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Establish </span>the testimony with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">profiting </span>by the first litigant <span class="gemarra-regular">alongside </span>the testimony with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">profitin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> by the second, and the two testimonies cancel each other out, leaving the testimony with regard to ownership by the ancestors of the first litigant. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">establish the land </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership of </span>the litigant who brought witnesses that it belonged to his <span class="gemarra-regular">ancestors. Rava </span>objected and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This testimony </span>cannot be relied on, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is contradicted </span>by the other testimony. Rav Naḥman responded and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Although </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">was contradicted with regard to profiting </span>from the land, 

Daf 31b

<span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted with regard to </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ancestors?</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say that Rava and Rav Naḥman disagree in the dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">two groups of witnesses that contradict each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">on its ow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and testifies, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own and testifies. </span>Despite the fact that one group certainly testified falsely, which should serve to disqualify one of the groups, each group is able to testify in another case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda says: Why do I</span> need <span class="gemarra-regular">these lying witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In other words, they are all disqualified to testify in another case until it is clarified which of them had testified falsely. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>is the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, and Rava </span>says his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>who holds that the witnesses are disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that the testimony concerning ancestral ownership is not accepted, as the witnesses were contradicted concerning their testimony of usage of the land, and Rav Naḥman’s ruling cannot accord with his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Naḥman and Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, </span>who does not disqualify the witnesses. The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span>and he therefore accepts the testimony with regard to ancestral ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava </span>would say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that the witnesses are accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">only for another testimony, </span>i.e., in a different case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the same testimony, </span>as in this incident, where both testimonies concerned ownership of the same land.
The Gemara relates the continuation of the case above. The one who had brought witnesses only to his having profited from the land <span class="gemarra-regular">then brought witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it </span>had belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to his ancestors, </span>thereby balancing the evidence for the two litigants. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: We </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">brought dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to the land the one who initially had evidence of ancestral ownership to take possession of it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">bring him up </span>from it, removing him from the land. And <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not concerned about </span>the possible <span class="gemarra-regular">contempt of court</span> that might result from perceived indecisiveness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, and some say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira, raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. If there was a married man whose fate was unknown, and <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>This married man <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: He did not die; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>This woman <span class="gemarra-regular">was divorced, and two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: She was not divorced, this </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">may not marry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as there is not unequivocal testimony that she is no longer married, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if she marries, </span>the marriage is valid and <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not leave </span>her husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: She </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>her husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Menaḥem, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei, said: When do I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>her husband? She must leave him <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where witnesses came </span>to testify that she is still married <span class="gemarra-regular">and she then married </span>despite their testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she married and the witnesses then came </span>to testify that she is still married, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>her husband based on the uncertainty created by contradictory witnesses. The fact that she is not required to leave her marriage in light of the new testimony seems to indicate an unwillingness to reverse the court’s ruling that she may marry, contrary to the ruling of Rav Naḥman.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">thought to perform an action </span>and reverse the court’s ruling, but <span class="gemarra-regular">now that you raised an objection against me, and Rav Hamnuna </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a </span>similar <span class="gemarra-regular">objection against me in Syria,</span> I will <span class="gemarra-regular">not perform an action in this </span>matter.
The Gemara relates that Rav Naḥman then <span class="gemarra-regular">went out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an action, </span>taking away the land from the litigant in whose favor he had previously ruled. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who saw </span>what he did <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> made <span class="gemarra-regular">a mistake, but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. Rather, </span>he performed an action despite the objections that had been raised <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">depends on great authorities [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ashlei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ravrevei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since, as the Gemara will demonstrate, this issue is subject to dispute between great authorities, he relied on those that supported his opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 23b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: One is not elevated to the </span>presumptive status of <span class="gemarra-regular">priesthood on the basis </span>of the testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of one witness. </span>Two witnesses are required for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: When </span>is that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are challengers </span>to his claim that he is a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no challengers, one is elevated to the </span>presumptive status of <span class="gemarra-regular">priesthoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the basis </span>of the testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of one witness. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy </span>High Priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">One is elevated to the </span>presumptive status of <span class="gemarra-regular">priesthood on the basis </span>of the testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of one witness.</span>
The Gemara asks: The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, </span>as they agree that one is elevated to the presumptive status of priesthood on the basis of one witness when there are no challengers. What is their dispute? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a challenge </span>posed by <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar holds: A challenge </span>posed by <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person is sufficient to undermine one’s presumptive status of priesthood, and two witnesses are required to overcome that challenge; 

Daf 32a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel holds </span>that an effective <span class="gemarra-regular">challenge </span>requires <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, one could then ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">challenge </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">fewer than two </span>witnesses?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">challenge </span>was established by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where we presume with regard to the fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of that </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is a priest, and a rumor emerged about </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is the son of </span>a priest and <span class="gemarra-regular">a divorced woman, or the son of </span>a priest and <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and we downgraded hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> from the presumptive status of priesthood based on that rumor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one witness came and said that </span>the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">is a priest </span>of unflawed lineage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we elevated </span>him back to the priesthood, as one witness is sufficient to negate a rumor.
The Gemara continues the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said that he is the son of a divorced woman or </span>the son of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and we downgraded him </span>from the priesthood based on their testimony. Then <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness came and said that he is a priest </span>of unflawed lineage, resulting in two witnesses testifying that his lineage is unflawed, and two testifying that it is flawed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And everyone </span>agrees that the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>of the two single witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>to produce testimony that he is a priest of unflawed lineage, and his presumptive status of priesthood should be restored.
The Gemara explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">And here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to concern about contempt of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. Rabbi Elazar holds: Once we downgraded him </span>from the presumptive status of priesthood based on the testimony of two witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">elevate him, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned about contempt of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> court, </span>as a reversal in the court’s decision creates the impression that the court operates indecisively. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel holds: We downgraded him </span>from the presumptive status of priesthood <span class="gemarra-regular">and we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">elevate him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we are not concerned about contempt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of court. </span>The primary concern is that the matter should be determined based on the relevant testimonies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi objects to </span>the analysis that they disagree with regard to concern about contempt of court: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why specifically </span>is it necessary to establish the dispute in a case where first <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>witness testified as to his unflawed lineage, and then another testified later? <span class="gemarra-regular">The same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would hold true even in </span>a case where two witnesses testified together that he is unfit for the priesthood and the court downgraded him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses testified together that he is fit for the priesthood and the court elevated him. The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> would <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>disagree, as the same concern applies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: Everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned about contempt of court. And here, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whether the court is able <span class="gemarra-regular">to combine </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony</span> of two single witnesses that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 5:5): The <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>of individual witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">never combines unless </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two of them see </span>the incident transpire together <span class="gemarra-regular">as one. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: </span>Their testimony combines <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>a case where they witnessed the event <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">their testimony is established in court only </span>if it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two of them testify </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">as one. Rabbi Natan says: </span>They are not required to testify together. Their testimony is combined even if the court <span class="gemarra-regular">hears the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of this </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">today and when the other </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives tomorrow </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">hears his statement. </span>Rabbi Elazar and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagree in the dispute between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis, whether the separate testimonies can be combined.
§ The Gemara relates an incident where two people disputed the ownership of land. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from you, and this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the bill </span>of sale. 

Daf 32b

The first <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a forged bill </span>of sale. The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">leaned </span>over and <span class="gemarra-regular">whispered to Rabba: Yes, it is a forged bill. But I had a proper bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was lost, and I said </span>to myself: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will hold this </span>bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, such as it is.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Why would he li</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and state this claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>to lie, he can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a proper bill </span>of sale, and he would have been deemed credible and awarded the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said to </span>Rabba: In the final analysis, <span class="gemarra-regular">on what </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">you relying </span>to award him the land? <span class="gemarra-regular">On this bill </span>of sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>admittedly forged <span class="gemarra-regular">bill is merely </span>a worthless <span class="gemarra-regular">shard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and cannot be used in court as evidence.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Give me one hundred dinars that I am </span>attempting to <span class="gemarra-regular">collect from you, and this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>that attests to the debt. The latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a forged </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note.</span> The first person <span class="gemarra-regular">leaned </span>over and <span class="gemarra-regular">whispered to Rava: Yes, it is a forged </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note. But I had a proper </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note and it was lost, and I said </span>to myself: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will hold this </span>promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, such as it is.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Why would he lie </span>and state this claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>to lie, he can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a proper </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>and he will be deemed credible and awarded the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said to </span>Rabba: In the final analysis, <span class="gemarra-regular">on what </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">you relying </span>to award him the money? <span class="gemarra-regular">On this </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note? This document is merely a shard, </span>and cannot be used in court as evidence.
The Gemara notes the final ruling in these two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to land, </span>and the possessor is awarded the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef with regard to money, </span>and the one demanding payment is not awarded the money. He explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba with regard to land, </span>as the court rules <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">remain where </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is, </span>i.e., with the possessor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef with regard to money, </span>as the court rules <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">remain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in the possession of the purported debtor.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain guarantor who said to a debtor: Give me one hundred dinars </span>for the money <span class="gemarra-regular">that I repaid the creditor on your </span>behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the documen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that I received from him when I repaid your debt. The debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the guarantor: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">I repaid you? </span>The guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the debtor: Yes, you did, but <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">you later took the </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from me </span>again?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin sent </span>the following question <span class="gemarra-regular">before Abaye: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this? Abaye sent him </span>the following response: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he, </span>i.e., Rav Idi bar Avin, <span class="gemarra-regular">ask? Isn’t he </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba with regard to land, and the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef with regard to money, </span>as the court rules <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">remain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is? </span>Based on his own ruling, the money should remain with the debtor.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this matter </span>applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the debtor: <span class="gemarra-regular">You later borrowed </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">from me </span>after you had repaid me. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the debtor: <span class="gemarra-regular">I returned to you </span>the money that you had repaid me <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>of the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the coins <span class="gemarra-regular">were worn out or </span>overly <span class="gemarra-regular">reddish, </span>i.e., discolored, and would not be easily accepted as currency, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the lien of the document is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">still </span>in effect. The debt to the guarantor had not actually been repaid, and the document is still in effect. In that case, the guarantor collects from the debtor.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A rumor emerged concerning Rava bar Sharshom that</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">was profiting </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">land belonging to orphans. Abaye said to him: Tell me, my friend, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident itself, how is it </span>that this rumor was generated? Rava bar Sharshom <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was holding </span>on to <span class="gemarra-regular">the land as collatera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the father of the orphans, and I had</span>

Daf 33a

<span class="gemarra-regular">other money with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he owed me money for a different reason, for which I had no collateral, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I profited from</span> the land <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the duration of the <span class="gemarra-regular">years of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">collateral</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to myself: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I return the land to the orphans </span>now that the years of collateral have finished, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say that I have other money with your </span>late <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>I will not be able to collect it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who comes to collec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can collect only by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, </span>and I do not wish to take an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather </span>than do that, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will suppress </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">document </span>detailing the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">of the collateral</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and profit from </span>the land up to the <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>that their father owed me. This is legitimate, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if I </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desire I can say: It is purchased, </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>would have been <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span>as I profited from the land for the years necessary to establish the presumption of ownership, so <span class="gemarra-regular">when I say that I have money with you, I </span>am also <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava bar Sharshom: Your reasoning is incorrect. You would <span class="gemarra-regular">not have been able to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is purchased, </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is publicity concerning it that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is land of orphans. </span>Therefore, you are unable to collect your debt based on the fact that you could have made a more advantageous claim [<span class="it-text">miggo</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, return </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the orphans now, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when the orphans become adults, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">litigate with them, </span>as you have no other option.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A relative of Rav Idi bar Avi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> died and left a date tree </span>as an inheritance. Another relative took possession of the tree, claiming to be a closer relative than Rav Idi bar Avin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: I am close</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in relation to the deceased than he, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that man said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I am closer </span>in relation to the deceased than Rav Idi bar Avin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>the other man <span class="gemarra-regular">admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Rav Idi bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>in fact, Rav Idi was <span class="gemarra-regular">closer </span>in relation to the deceased. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda established </span>the date tree <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of </span>Rav Idi bar Avin.
Rav Idi bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: The value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that he consumed </span>unlawfully <span class="gemarra-regular">from that day </span>when he took possession of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">until now should be returned to me. </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this he about</span> whom people <span class="gemarra-regular">say: He is a great man? On whom is the Master basing </span>his claim to receive the value of the produce? <span class="gemarra-regular">On this </span>other relative. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he was saying </span>until this point: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am close</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in relation to the deceased than he. Therefore, you have ownership of the tree only from the time of his admission, and not from when he took possession of the tree. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava do not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>

Daf 33b

as they hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the other relative <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>that he is not a closer relative, <span class="gemarra-regular">he admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that he never had any right to the produce of the tree. Therefore, by his own admission, he is liable to reimburse Rav Idi bar Avin.
§ There was an incident where two people dispute the ownership of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses that </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to his ancestors, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings witnesses that </span>he worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The one who is in possession of the land is deemed credible due to the legal principle that if one would have been deemed credible had he stated one claim but instead stated another claim that accomplishes the same result, he has credibility, because <span class="gemarra-regular">why would he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">li</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and state this claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>to lie, he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I purchased it from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye and Rava do not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>because they hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why would I lie, </span>applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>contradicting the claim he is stating, and in this case, witnesses testify that it belonged to the ancestors of the other claimant.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want with this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">went and brought witnesses that </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">two years, </span>but he was unable to bring witnesses to testify about a third year. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> land reverts </span>back to the prior owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce </span>consumed during those two years <span class="gemarra-regular">revert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to the prior owner. Since the possessor was unable to substantiate his claim to the land, the assumption is that he consumed the produce unlawfully.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: If</span> initially, when questioned by the other, the one occupying the land <span class="gemarra-regular">claimed and said: I entered </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>consume its <span class="gemarra-regular">produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that I had purchased, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Yehuda say: This one who is holding a sickle and rope [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vetovelaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and says: I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go cull [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">igderei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> the dates from <span class="gemarra-regular">the date tree of so-and-so who sold it to me, is deemed credible </span>that he has the right to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, a person is not </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">braze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>he would <span class="gemarra-regular">cull </span>the dates of <span class="gemarra-regular">a date tree that is not his. Here too, </span>in the case discussed by Rav Zevid, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">brazen </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">to consume produce that is not his.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that the assumption is that he would not lie, let one be deemed credible with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the land as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara answers: In terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">the land, we say to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Show your bill </span>of sale if you indeed purchased it. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then in terms of the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce as well, </span>let him be deemed credible only if he can produce documentation of his claim. The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>to write <span class="gemarra-regular">documents to </span>establish the right to consume <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span> alone, and one can therefore claim to have consumed the produce based on an oral agreement.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want with this land </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span> in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited from it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought one witness </span>who testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for the necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">three years. The Rabbis </span>who were studying <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye maintained </span>that it made sense <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that the principle in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as that in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">piece of cast metal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naskha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> adjudicated <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara now presents that case: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who snatched a piece of cast metal from another. </span>The one from whom it was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ami </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba was sitting before him, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">brought one witness </span>who testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it was, in fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">snatched from him. </span>The one who snatched it <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, </span>it is true that <span class="gemarra-regular">I snatched </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">snatched </span>that which was <span class="gemarra-regular">mine. Rabbi Ami said: </span>

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">How should judges judg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for this judgment? </span>There are reasons not to implement all potential rulings. If they were to order the one who snatched the metal <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>for it, that would not be the correct ruling, because <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not two witnesses</span> who saw him snatch it, and the court does not force payment based on the testimony of one witness. If they were <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>accept his claim and <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt him </span>entirely, that would not be the correct ruling, because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is one witness </span>who testified against him. If they were to order him <span class="gemarra-regular">to take an oath, </span>which is the usual response to counter the testimony of one witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t he sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that he did in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">snatch it, and since he said that he snatched it </span>and there is no proof that it is his, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is like a robber, </span>and the court does not allow a robber to take an oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to them: He </span>is one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath who is unable to take an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and anyone who is liable </span>to take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath who is unable to take an oath </span>is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay. </span>The Rabbis who were studying before Abaye thought that the case of the witness to the years of profiting and Rabbi Abba’s case are similar, in that since the possessor is unable to take an oath to refute the witness, as he concedes that he profited from the land for those years, he should have to pay for his consumption of the produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>these Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>these two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, </span>in Rabbi Abba’s case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the witness is coming to undermine </span>the position of the one who snatched the metal. This can be seen from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>it would be the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to court and testifies <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the first witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">take away </span>the piece of metal <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the one who snatched it. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the individual who brought one witness to attest to his profiting from the land, the witness <span class="gemarra-regular">is coming to suppor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the possessor. This can be seen from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">when another </span>witness would <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to court and testify with the first witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession. </span>Therefore, the testimony of the one witness does not render the one who profited from the land liable to take an oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abba is comparable </span>to a case such as this, it is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness and </span>he testifies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>someone’s profiting from land for <span class="gemarra-regular">two years</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the comparison is in terms of payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span> that he consumed. In terms of the consumption of the produce, two witnesses would have rendered the possessor liable to pay, as consumption of the produce for only two years does not establish the presumption of ownership. Therefore, one witness renders him liable to take an oath. Since he himself claimed that he profited from the land as the witness testified, he cannot take an oath to contest the testimony. Therefore, he would have to pay for the produce. 

Daf 34b

§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain boat that two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were quarrelin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> about with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is mine, and that </span>one also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is mine. One of them came to court and said: Seize i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until I </span>am able to <span class="gemarra-regular">bring witnesses that it is mine. </span>The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <span class="gemarra-regular">we seize </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we not seize </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: We seize </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: We </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not seize </span>it, as there is no cause for the court to intervene.
The court seized the boat. The one who requested of the court to seize it <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>to seek witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">but did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not find witnesses. </span>He then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Release </span>the boat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and whoever is stronger prevails</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this is the ruling in a case where there is neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <span class="gemarra-regular">we release </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we not release </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: We </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not release </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: We release </span>it. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not seiz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> property in a case where ownership is uncertain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and where </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">seized, we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not release </span>it.
There was an incident where two people dispute the ownership of property. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and I inherited it from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to my ancestors </span>and I inherited it from them. There was neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Whoever is stronger prevails</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>the case where two people produce <span class="gemarra-regular">two deeds </span>of sale or gift for the same field <span class="gemarra-regular">that are issued on one day, </span>

Daf 35a

<span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav said: </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should divid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the property between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: </span>It is decided based on the <span class="gemarra-regular">discretion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shudda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the judges</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why in the seemingly equivalent case of a dispute where there is no evidence for either litigant did Rav Naḥman rule that whoever is stronger prevails? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the two deeds, it will <span class="gemarra-regular">not be </span>possible for the court <span class="gemarra-regular">to clarify the matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the future, and therefore, the court issues a ruling according to the information they currently have. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of Rav Naḥman, it may <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>possible for the court <span class="gemarra-regular">to clarify the matter </span>in the future, if one of the litigants was to bring witnesses supporting his claim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from that which we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 100a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who exchanges a cow for a donke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">calved, and similarly one who sells his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant and she gave birth, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, i.e., the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: She gave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> birth before I sold </span>either the cow or maidservant, and the offspring belongs to me; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, i.e., the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: She gave birth after I purchased her </span>and the offspring belongs to me, the ruling is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divide </span>the value of the newborn. In that case, the court is not able to clarify the matter, so they should rule that whoever is stronger prevails.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the exchange, <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>one, i.e., the buyer, 

Daf 35b

<span class="gemarra-regular">he has financial involvement [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">derara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for that </span>one, i.e., the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has financial involvement. </span>Since each of them has a definite claim to owning the offspring, as each of them owned the cow or maidservant at one point, it is reasonable for the court to divide the offspring between the two parties. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, and if </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master. </span>Only one of the two litigants has any claim to the property, as it belonged either to the ancestors of this one or of that one. Therefore, a ruling to divide it would not be appropriate.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Neharde’a say: </span>In a case where two parties disputed the ownership of a certain property and the court ruled that whoever is stronger prevails, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one from the marketplace </span>who had no claim <span class="gemarra-regular">came and took possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of it, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not remove it from his possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 10:14): <span class="gemarra-regular">A robber of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">public, </span>meaning a robber whose victim is unknown, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called a robber.</span> Since it is unclear whom he robbed, no one is able to demand payment. Here too, since it is unclear whose property it is, neither can demand that it be taken from the robber.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>in disagreement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is called a robber, </span>and the property is taken from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what </span>is meant by: He <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called a robber? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the stolen item is <span class="gemarra-regular">not subject to being returned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and consequently he is unable to fully atone, as he does not know whom to repay.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to certain types of property that <span class="gemarra-regular">their presumptive ownership</span> is established by use of a duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">three years from day to day. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba says: </span>Nevertheless, there are cases where presumptive ownership is established immediately. For example, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">himself lifte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a basket of fruit </span>from that field <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the possessor, that <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, and the prior owner can no longer lodge a protest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">stated a claim and said: I brought him dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> into my field solely <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>consume the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., as a sharecropper, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">credible. And that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that the prior owner is deemed credible were he to state such a claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only if he stated it <span class="gemarra-regular">within three </span>years of when the other took possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">but after three </span>years he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>deemed credible.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: If </span>in fact he did <span class="gemarra-regular">bring him down </span>into the field solely <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>consume the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, what was </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">for him to do </span>to prevent the possessor from establishing the presumption of ownership? Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He should have protested </span>during the first three years and publicized that he had granted the possessor rights to the produce alone.
The assumption that lodging a protest would be effective must be correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if you do not say so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">this mortgage </span>according to the custom <span class="gemarra-regular">in Sura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a city in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">written: At the completion of these years this land will be released </span>to its prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>any need for the prior owner to give <span class="gemarra-regular">money, if </span>the creditor were to <span class="gemarra-regular">hide </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mortgage document in his possession and say: </span>This land <span class="gemarra-regular">is purchased </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, here </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he would be <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible? </span>That cannot be, as is it reasonable that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages would institute a matter, </span>such as this type of arrangement, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">can be led by it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">a loss? Rather, </span>in the case of the mortgage the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">should have protested, </span>and by not protesting, he causes his own loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>in the case of the field, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">protested.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew who comes </span>to claim land <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span> having received it from <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is like a gentile </span>in terms of which legal claims are available to him. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a gentile has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> only by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a document</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, a Jew who comes </span>to claim land <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>having received it from <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> only by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a document. Rava said: And if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew said </span>to a prior owner, who claims to still own the land: 

Daf 36a

The <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile told me that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased</span> a field <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, </span>this claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there any case where if a gentile says </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not deemed credible, but if a Jew said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the gentile’s name he would be deemed credible?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: If a Jew said </span>to the prior owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">A gentile purchased </span>a field <span class="gemarra-regular">from you in my presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it to me, </span>this claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, since if he wanted </span>to, he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the prior owner of the land: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you.</span>
The Gemara records a series of <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> pertaining to presumptive ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: This one who is holding a sickle and rope and says: I will go cull </span>the dates from <span class="gemarra-regular">the date tree of so-and-so, from whom I purchased it,</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>The reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is not </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">brazen that </span>he would <span class="gemarra-regular">cull </span>the dates from <span class="gemarra-regular">a date tree that is not his.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possesses </span>a field only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the fenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> built to prevent the entry <span class="gemarra-regular">of the wild donkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and outwar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> toward the public property, this conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason? </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everything that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">sows, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wild donkeys </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">eat as well, </span>and cannot establish the presumption of ownership for him, as he is not profiting from the land as an owner would.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">produce from the first three years after it was planted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> during which time one is prohibited from deriving benefit from the produce, this conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land by consuming <span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span> produce, or profited from the land by consuming produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>consumed produce that was prohibited as it was of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land by consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">fodder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., produce that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, this conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava said: But if </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">located in</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">neck of Meḥoza, </span>a valley where it was common to harvest unripe produce to feed animals, this conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>Consumption of produce of land that is <span class="gemarra-regular">fissure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. This is due to the fact that produce does not grow well there, and therefore, owners do not bother to protest if a trespasser uses the land. Therefore, their silence should not be understood as an admission that it belongs to the possessor. Similarly, consumption of produce of land where one <span class="gemarra-regular">expends a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> of seed to sow <span class="gemarra-regular">and retrieves a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> of produce when harvesting it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. Here, too, the owners do not bother to protest, as the land is of inferior quality.
Rav Naḥman continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">of the household of the Exilarc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> do <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> in our </span>land, as people are afraid to lodge a protest against them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not establish</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> in their </span>land, as, due to their wealth, they might not lodge a protest against one who trespasses on their land.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, </span>presumption of ownership of them is established by using them for a duration of three years from day to day. The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, is</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership of them? But doesn’t Reish Lakish say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">livestock [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hagoderot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession of them does not </span>establish the presumption of ownership, since they wander from place to place. Therefore, one cannot claim that his mere possession of livestock demonstrates ownership as one can with regard to other movable items, because it may have wandered into his property on its own. The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply with regard to a slave. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said:</span> It is true that <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of them does not </span>establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but there is presumptive ownership of them after three years.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: If </span>the slave in question <span class="gemarra-regular">was a small </span>child <span class="gemarra-regular">placed in a cradle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession of him does </span>establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, </span>as it does with regard to other movable items. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>since he cannot move on his own? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has a mother. Lest you say: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">should be concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps his mother brought him up to there, </span>and his being on another’s property does not indicate that the latter is his master. Therefore, Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that there is no concern about this possibility, since <span class="gemarra-regular">a mother does not forget her son. </span>Therefore, possession of the infant slave does establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara relates: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>certain <span class="gemarra-regular">goats that ate peeled </span>barley [<span class="gemarra-italic">ḥushela</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">in Neharde’a. The owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">peeled </span>barley <span class="gemarra-regular">came and seized </span>the goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">and was claiming a large </span>sum of money for the barley from the owner of the goats. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s father said: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to claim up t</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of </span>the goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>to, he could <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The goats <span class="gemarra-regular">are purchased </span>and that is why they are <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Reish Lakish say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">livestock, </span>possession of them <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Goats are different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">given to shepherds, </span>and do not wander on their own.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is morning and evening </span>to consider, when the goats are unsupervised when traveling between the owner and the shepherd, and during those times this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of livestock should apply with regard to them. The Gemara explains: The case under discussion took place in Neharde’a, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Arabs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tayya’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who steal animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are common in Neharde’a, and </span>goats there are <span class="gemarra-regular">delivered from hand to hand </span>and are never left unsupervised.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months </span>of possession in the first year, three months of possession in the third year, and twelve months of possession in the middle, which are eighteen months, suffices to establish the presumption of ownership. Rabbi Akiva disagrees, and says that one month in the first and third year, in addition to the full middle year, is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them is </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing </span>the land is sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yishmael holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, and three months are needed for the crop to grow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Akiva holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, and therefore one month is sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>their opinions this way? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Akiva, why specifically</span> require a full <span class="gemarra-regular">month? </span>

Daf 36b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if he plowed the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day </span>in the first and third years respectively, it should be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and here </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span> their opinions is whether in order to establish the presumption of ownership one needs to possess the land long enough to grow <span class="gemarra-regular">major produce, </span>which requires three months to grow, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">minor produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which requires one month.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Plowing is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: This is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Whose </span>opinion is it that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to as: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say? Rav Ḥisda said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed </span>the field for <span class="gemarra-regular">a yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sowed it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years, or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> years <span class="gemarra-regular">and sowed it </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span> sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Aḥa says: This is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, which indicates that he holds that plowing establishes the presumption of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: I asked all </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">great </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">of the generation </span>about this, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said to me: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing, this is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Beivai said to Rav Naḥman: What is the reason of the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? Rav Naḥman answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person is not apt to </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">his land plowed </span>by someone else <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">silent. </span>Rav Beivai asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason of the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? Rav Naḥman answered: The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to himself: Let <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every clump [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shibba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of earth <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the plow. That is to say, the owner is amenable to having someone else plow the land for him, and then he will sow and harvest.
The <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of Pum Nahara sent </span>a question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda. Our teacher, instruct us: Is plowing </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership,<span class="gemarra-regular"> or is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Rabbi Aḥa and all </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">great </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">of the generation say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing, this is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">a novelty to enumerate </span>great <span class="gemarra-regular">men</span> who maintain an opinion without taking into account that of others? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel in Babylonia, and Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva in Eretz Yisrael, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Plowing is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership?
The Gemara presents the sources for ascribing to these Sages the opinion that plowing does not establish the presumption of ownership. The basis for ascribing it to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is the mishna, </span>as the Gemara explained above. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the basis for ascribing this opinion to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? As Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: This </span>ruling that either a month or three months is sufficient use for the first and third years is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, but the Rabbis, </span>whose opinion is accepted, <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>With regard to a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">its presumption </span>of ownership is established by <span class="gemarra-regular">three years, from day to day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">From day to day, </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? </span>Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude plowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which does not </span>establish the presumption of ownership?
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the basis for ascribing this opinion to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel? As Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: This </span>ruling that either a month or three months is sufficient use for the first and third years is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, but the Rabbis, </span>whose opinion is accepted, <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>He does not establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">harvests three </span>date <span class="gemarra-regular">crops</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or harvests three </span>grape <span class="gemarra-regular">crops, or harvests three </span>olive <span class="gemarra-regular">crops. </span>This indicates that Shmuel holds that plowing does not establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">betwee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> the opinions of Rav and Shmuel? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>their opinions is whether three harvests of <span class="gemarra-regular">a young [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">na’ara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] date tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which produces </span>a crop <span class="gemarra-regular">three times in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">year, </span>establishes the presumption of ownership.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that eighteen months are required to establish the presumption of ownership of a non-irrigated field, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? With regard to a white field, </span>i.e., a grain field. But with regard to an orchard, harvesting three different crops suffices. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: From </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yishmael we infer </span>the proper understanding of a detail of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>who disagree with him, and hold that three years of harvesting one crop is required to establish the presumption of ownership even with regard to an orchard: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thirty trees </span>of one type in a field, and they were <span class="gemarra-regular">planted </span>with a density of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten trees per </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and one <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>the produce of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and </span>of another <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and </span>of another <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>third <span class="gemarra-regular">year, this is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership.

Daf 37a

The Gemara explains the inference from the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and how it clarifies the opinion of the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Yishmael say </span>that harvesting <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> for all </span>of the types of <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit, </span>i.e., for the entire field? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, these </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>sufficient to establish the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> for those </span>trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>sufficient to establish the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> for these </span>trees.
The Gemara notes two restrictions to the aforementioned ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the other twenty trees <span class="gemarra-regular">did not produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the other trees <span class="gemarra-regular">produced </span>fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not consume </span>their fruit, then his conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership with regard to the other trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>principle, that consuming the produce of some of the trees each year establishes the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership for the entire field, applies only if it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are scattered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">devazei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bazuzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> throughout the field. Otherwise, he establishes the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> of ownership only over the section where the trees are located.
§ In a case where there was a field with trees in it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">took possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the trees and that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the land, Rav Zevid says: This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land. Rav Pappa objects to this: If </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees has no </span>share <span class="gemarra-regular">in the land at all. Let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land say to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees: Uproot your trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take</span> them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and go. Rather, Rav Pappa said: This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees and half </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired half </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
The Gemara notes: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>a section of <span class="gemarra-regular">land and left </span>the ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees </span>in that land <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has </span>ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>surrounding the trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who sells, sells generously, </span>and he is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified, because <span class="gemarra-regular">that statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>a case such as when one sold land and retained ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit or a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In that case, Rabbi Akiva ruled that he does not retain any land, not even a path to access the pit or cistern, as he sold generously, including all of the land in the sale.
The Gemara explains the difference between the cases: That ruling applies there, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the pit or cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">causes no harm to the land</span> surrounding them, and since the seller does not foresee a conflict arising from his pit and cistern being located adjacent to the buyer’s property, he therefore transfers the entire land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of his retaining the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees, </span>

Daf 37b

<span class="gemarra-regular">since they are causing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">harm to the land, </span>the seller does <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>the land that is surrounding the trees for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not leave </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Uproot your trees and go.</span>
The Gemara discusses the reverse case: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees and left</span> the ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> depends on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>outcome of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute of Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis. According to Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sells, sells generously, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>ownership of the land surrounding the trees, as the presumption is that the seller included it in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, </span>who say: One who sells, sells sparingly, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>ownership of the land surrounding the trees, as the presumption is that the seller did not include it in the sale.
The Gemara stated previously that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>ownership of the land surrounding the trees. The Gemara clarifies this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to Rav Zevid, who said </span>(37a) that in a case where one took possession of the land and another took possession of the trees, the one who took possession of the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>share in the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">that matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buyers. As </span>in that case, the one who acquired the land can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that I have no</span> share <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trees, you also have no </span>share <span class="gemarra-regular">in the land; but here, </span>where one sold the trees and left the land for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously. </span>Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the sale included the land surrounding the trees.
The Gemara stated earlier that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not have </span>ownership of the land surrounding the trees. The Gemara clarifies this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to Rav Pappa, who says </span>above that in a case where one took possession of the land and another took possession of the trees that the one who took possession of the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>ownership of half of the land as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">that matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two buyers. As </span>in that case, the one who acquired the trees can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to you generously,</span> as you have both the land and the right to consume its produce, he <span class="gemarra-regular">also sold to me generously, </span>including the land surrounding the trees; <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, </span>where one sold the trees and left the land for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who sells, sells sparingly, </span>retaining for himself whatever he did not explicitly include in the sale.
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Neharde’a say: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>the produce of <span class="gemarra-regular">an overcrowded </span>orchard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">have presumptive ownershi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> of the orchard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this: If that is so, how </span>does one ever <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire this alfalf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field, </span>which is planted without spacing? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold an overcrowded</span> orchard, the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not have </span>ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span> surrounding the trees. Generally, if one purchases three or more trees, he acquires the surrounding land, as the trees are considered an orchard. If the trees are overcrowded, they will soon have to be uprooted, and that is why the buyer does not acquire the land surrounding the trees.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 5:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard that is planted on </span>an area where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">les</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than four cubits </span>of open space between the vines, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, as it is overcrowded. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: This is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, and </span>the reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle </span>vines are <span class="gemarra-regular">viewed as if </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. It follows that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, if one sold an overcrowded orchard, the middle trees would be viewed as if they were not there. Therefore, it would be considered an orchard and the buyer would acquire the land surrounding the trees.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This one who sells a date tree to another, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">from its botto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until the depths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 38a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava objects to this </span>ruling that the buyer of the tree acquires the land beneath it: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">say to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: I sold you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the saffron crocus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a small plant normally uprooted by the buyer and taken with him. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">uproot the saffron crocus and go. Rather, Rava said: </span>This ruling is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a specific <span class="gemarra-regular">clai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that the seller had stipulated that he would acquire the land. Without this specific claim he does not acquire the land beneath the tree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Kashisha, the son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if, </span>in fact, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him the saffron crocus, what was </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">to do </span>to prevent the buyer from claiming the land beneath the tree, as the buyer could claim that there had been an explicit stipulation that he receive it? Rav Ashi answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">He should have protested </span>during the first three years and publicized that the land was not included in the sale.
The assumption that lodging a protest would be effective must be correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if you do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">these mortgages </span>according to the custom <span class="gemarra-regular">in Sura, </span>a city in Babylonia, the debtor will not have a way to prevent the creditor from keeping his land. <span class="gemarra-regular">As in </span>mortgages of that type it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written like this: At the completion of these years this land will be released </span>to its prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>any need for the prior owner to give <span class="gemarra-regular">money. If </span>the creditor were to <span class="gemarra-regular">hide </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mortgage document in his possession and say: </span>This land <span class="gemarra-regular">is purchased </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, here </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he would be <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible? </span>That cannot be, as is it reasonable that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages would institute a matter, </span>such as this type of arrangement, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">can be led by it to </span>suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">a loss? Rather, </span>in the case of the mortgage the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">should have protested, </span>and by not protesting, he causes his own loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of the tree, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should have protested.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>independent <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>establishing <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership: Judea, and Transjordan, and the Galilee. </span>If the prior owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">was in Judea and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession </span>of his field <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Galilee, </span>or if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Galilee and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession </span>of his field <span class="gemarra-regular">in Judea, </span>the possessor does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership until </span>the one possessing the field <span class="gemarra-regular">will be with </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">in one province. Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that establishing presumptive ownership requires <span class="gemarra-regular">three years only in order that </span>if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Spain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aspamya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">possesses </span>his field for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year, </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will go and inform </span>the owner by the end of the next <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and </span>the owner will <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">following year </span>and take the possessor to court.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What does the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold </span>in ruling that the prior owner and the field need be in the same province in order for the possessor to establish presumptive ownership? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that is </span>lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in the presence of </span>the one possessing the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>in the case where one is in <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea and </span>one is in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Galilee, </span>the protest should be valid <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest </span>lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, even </span>in the case where one is in <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea and </span>the other one is in <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea, </span>the protest should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be valid <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest </span>lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught our mishna with regard to a period of crisis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when travel is perilous and information cannot be transmitted between Judea and the Galilee. Therefore, although no word of a protest was received, the possessor does not establish presumptive ownership of the field. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it is due only to the exigent circumstances that word of the protest does not reach the one possessing the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Galilee that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">cited? </span>Ostensibly, even within one of the three lands, if travel and communications are restricted the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, by citing specifically a case where each is located in a different land, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: </span>

Daf 38b

<span class="gemarra-regular">That an ordinary </span>situation with regard to travel between <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Galile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is tantamount to a period of crisis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot establish </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the property of </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing, </span>as he is unable to lodge a protest. Rav Yehuda reports: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I said this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel, he </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: But does </span>the owner actually <span class="gemarra-regular">have to protest in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presence of</span> the possessor? Since that is not the case, and he can lodge a protest wherever he is, one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav, </span>who ruled that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his presence is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest? But doesn’t Rav say: A protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was explaining </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">himself does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not hold accordingly. </span>Rav holds, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, that the protest is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">can establish </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the property of </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Yehuda reports: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I said this</span> ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he said to me: </span>Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? But does </span>the owner actually <span class="gemarra-regular">have to protest in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presence of</span> the possessor?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav, </span>who ruled that one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest? But Rav </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">said this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one time, </span>and he would not need to repeat it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: That even if</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">proteste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the presence of two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">who are </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">unable to tel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> the possessor about the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>nevertheless a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Anan said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me personally by Shmuel himself: </span>If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">protested in the presence of two people who are able to </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">tell </span>the possessor, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, </span>but if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">protested in the presence of two people who are unable to </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">tell </span>the possessor, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest. And </span>why does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>hold that it is a valid protest? Because <span class="gemarra-regular">your friend </span>who heard the protest <span class="gemarra-regular">has a friend </span>to whom he tells about the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your friend’s friend has a friend </span>to whom he tells about the protest, and so forth. Therefore, word of the protest will reach the possessor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot establish </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the property of </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a possessor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest. </span>The Gemara asks: How can he say these <span class="gemarra-regular">tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> statements that contradict each other? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. Here, </span>the second statement, is referring to a case where he is <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing due to monetary </span>difficulties. In such a case, he is able to ensure that the protest reaches the possessor, while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the first statement, is referring to a case where he is <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing due to </span>a charge of <span class="gemarra-regular">killing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meradin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a case, he is unable to publicize his protest out of fear of revealing his whereabouts.
§ The Gemara presents a series of disputes with regard to what is considered a valid protest. <span class="gemarra-regular">What manner </span>of statement constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Zevid said: </span>If the owner says in general terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so is a robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, </span>but if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so is a robber as </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is holding my land through robbery, </span>

Daf 39a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and tomorrow, </span>i.e., in the future, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will bring a claim </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest.</span>
If the one lodging a protest also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Do not tell </span>the possessor of the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said:</span> It is not a valid protest, because <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t he saying: Do not tell </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him? </span>Therefore, word of the protest will not reach the possessor and it is meaningless. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the owner merely meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not tell him personally, </span>but they, i.e. the witnesses, should <span class="gemarra-regular">tell others.</span> In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <span class="gemarra-regular">your friend has a friend </span>whom he tells about the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your friend’s friend has a friend </span>whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.
If the witnesses before whom the owner lodged the protest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">tell </span>the possessor about your protest, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said:</span> It is not a valid protest, and he has to lodge a protest before other witnesses, as are <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">saying to him: We are not </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">tell him </span>about your protest? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that they merely meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">tell him personally, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">we are </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">tell others. </span>In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <span class="gemarra-regular">your friend has a friend </span>whom he tells about the protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your friend’s friend has a friend </span>whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.
If the one lodging the protest also <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: A word [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should not emerge from yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> about this, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>It is not a valid protest, as <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t he saying </span>to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">A word should not emerge </span>from you? Similarly, if the people before whom he protested <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We will not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">a word emerge </span>from us, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It is not a valid protest, as <span class="gemarra-regular">aren’t they saying to him: We will not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">a word emerge </span>from us? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is a valid protest, because with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any matter that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">incumben</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a person </span>to keep secret, it is likely that he will <span class="gemarra-regular">say it</span> to others <span class="gemarra-regular">unawares, </span>and therefore the presumption is that word will reach the possessor.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: A protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presence</span> of the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest. Rava raised an objection to </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>said from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that establishing the presumption of ownership requires <span class="gemarra-regular">three years only in order that </span>if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Spain and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">possesses </span>his field for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year, </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will go and inform </span>the owner by the end of the next <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and </span>the owner will <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">following year </span>and take the possessor to court. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, why do I </span>need the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to come? Let him remain there in his place and protest. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Rabbi Yehuda wishes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us good advice, that he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">come and collect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the land and </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">produce.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the fact </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman, it may be inferred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not hold that a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest. But doesn’t Rava say: A protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest? </span>The Gemara answers: He <span class="gemarra-regular">held that </span>conclusion only <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">heard this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from Rav Naḥman.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, encountered </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">students of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">how many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest </span>must be lodged? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>says: <span class="gemarra-regular">A protest </span>must be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">A protest </span>must be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of three </span>people.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say that they disagree with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna? As Rabba bar Rav Huna says: Any matter that is said in the presence of three </span>people

Daf 39b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is already public knowledge. The Gemara elaborates on the suggestion that the dispute hinges upon this point: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that a protest can be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">is not of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna </span>and holds that even if only two people hear of a matter it will become a matter of public knowledge. Therefore, it is sufficient to protest in the presence of two witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that a protest must be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna.</span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna, and here they disagree with regard to this: The one who says</span> that a protest can be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">hold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presence is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest. </span>Therefore, two witnesses suffice, as they are needed to attest only to the fact that the owner protested. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that a protest must be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest.</span> Since the protest can be lodged not in the possessor’s presence, three people are needed to ensure that word of the protest will reach him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">a protest that </span>is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">protest, and here they disagree with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this: The one who says </span>that a protest can be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require testimony</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and two are sufficient for testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that a protest must be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter </span>of the protest be <span class="gemarra-regular">revealed, </span>and for that purpose three people are needed.
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel bar Minyumi had a protest to lodge </span>with regard to his property. He <span class="gemarra-regular">found Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav and Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tuvi, who were sitting, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">protested before them. After a year, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to them <span class="gemarra-regular">again to protest. They said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You do not need </span>to do so; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what Rav says: Once </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">protested </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">first year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he no longer needs to protest. And there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav said to him, </span>not in the name of Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">protested </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">first year, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer needs to protest.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says in the name of bar Kappara: And </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to protest at the end of each and every </span>period of <span class="gemarra-regular">thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> years, so that the possessor will not hold his property for three consecutive years uncontested. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan expressed surprise at this </span>ruling of Reish Lakish and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does a robber have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? Once the owner lodged one protest, he demonstrated that the possessor occupied his land unlawfully. Therefore, the possessor should never be able to establish the presumption of ownership. The Gemara clarifies: Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that the possessor is actually <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber? </span>There is no evidence that he robbed, there is only a protest by the prior owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>emend his question as follows: Does one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">akin to a robber have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is: The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to protest at the end of each and every </span>period of <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span> years. <span class="gemarra-regular">Bar Kappara teaches: </span>If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">protested, returned and protested</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and then <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and protested, if, </span>when he <span class="gemarra-regular">protested</span> the later times, his protest was <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the same claim as the <span class="gemarra-regular">initial claim, </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">has no presumptive ownership. But if </span>the later protests were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>based on the same claim as the initial protest, the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">has presumptive ownership </span>since each time the owner advanced a new claim, he thereby nullified his earlier claims.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: A protest </span>can be lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> witnesses, 

Daf 40a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need to say </span>to the witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a document detailing the protest; they can write one even absent a directive. Similarly, one who desires to state <span class="gemarra-regular">a declaration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> preemptively invalidating a bill of sale by notifying the court that it was executed under duress, needs to state the declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need to say </span>to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Write </span>a document detailing the declaration; they can write one even absent a directive.
The Gemara continues with the statement of Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">An admission </span>of a monetary obligation needs to be stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> in this case, the one stating the admission <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to the witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a document detailing the admission, as this document is to his detriment; they may not write one absent a directive. <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquisition </span>by means of a symbolic act utilizing a cloth needs to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the parties do <span class="gemarra-regular">not need to say </span>to the witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a document detailing the acquisition; they can write one even absent a directive. <span class="gemarra-regular">And ratification of </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">documents</span> needs to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> people.
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> for the cases discussed above: <span class="gemarra-italic">Mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>protest [<span class="it-text">meḥa’a</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> declaration [<span class="it-text">moda’a</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">heh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>admission [<span class="it-text">hoda’a</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>acquisition [<span class="it-text">kinyan</span>].
Rava now discusses the statement of Rav Naḥman that he quoted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: If </span>any part of this statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult to me, this </span>is what is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult to me. This acquisition, what is it like? If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like an act of the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it should require three </span>witnesses for it to take effect, as a court must consist of at least three men. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like an act of the court, why does he not have to say </span>to the witnesses that they should <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>the document detailing the acquisition? Isn’t transferring an item to another tantamount to admitting a monetary obligation?
<span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemma, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolves it. Actually, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not considered like an act of the court. And here, what is the reason that he does not have to say </span>to the witnesses that they should <span class="gemarra-regular">write? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a record of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unspecified acquisition </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ready to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A symbolic act of acquisition indicates one’s intention to do everything possible to finalize the transaction as soon as possible without waiting for the actual transfer of the item. Therefore, it is assumed that the parties would desire that a document be written, and no explicit authorization is necessary.
§ The Gemara discusses the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a preemptive declaration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: We write </span>a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration only concerning one who does not </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">listen to </span>and implement <span class="gemarra-regular">the judgment </span>of the court. In such a case, there is no recourse other than to write a preemptive declaration on behalf of the seller nullifying the transaction. If the buyer would be willing to listen to the court, the seller is expected to deal with the matter in court, rather than participating in the sale and writing a preemptive declaration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava both say: </span>A preemptive declaration may be written <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>concerning someone who is law abiding, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">for me and for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as not every issue can be settled through the courts. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a say: Any </span>preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration</span>

Daf 40b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">written in it </span>the formulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are aware of so-and-so’s duress</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., we are aware of the nature of the coercion that forced him to enter this arrangement against his will, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a valid preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>type of transaction is the preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration </span>being stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one were to say that it is a preemptive declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">for a bill of divorce or for a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the preemptive declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">is merely revealing the matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since these actions can’t take place unless he desires it, it is sufficient that he stated that he does not desire them, and he need not specify a particular reason for nullifying them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for a sale, but doesn’t Rava say: We do not write </span>a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration for a sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to a preemptive declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">for a sale, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava concedes </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one was compelled to ac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> due to a threat of monetary loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">as with the incident of the orchard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who mortgaged </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">orchard to another for three years. After he </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">three years </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If you sell </span>the orchard <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. And if not, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will hide </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mortgage document and I will say </span>that this land <span class="gemarra-regular">is purchased </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>and you will receive no payment for the orchard. <span class="gemarra-regular">In a case like this, we write </span>a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration. </span>The declaration states that he does not actually desire to sell his property but was forced to do so.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>document detailing <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we do not collect with it. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed gift? Rav Yosef said: </span>It is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">said to witnesses: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hide and write </span>a document <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the recipient of this gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>It is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to </span>witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sit outdoors in the marketplac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and write </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two versions of Rav Yosef’s statement? The Gemara answers: The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two versions is in a case where his instructions were <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he did not tell them to write the document in private or in public.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: But </span>a concealed gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> effective as a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration for anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> gift. In other words, if he first gave an item as a concealed gift to one person, and then he gave this item as a gift to someone else, the second gift is null and void. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference, </span>and he did not, in fact, hold accordingly.
Rav Pappa explains the inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who went to betrot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a woman. She said to him: If you write </span>a document signing over <span class="gemarra-regular">all of your property to me, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will be your </span>wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, I will not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">He went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a document signing over <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to her. His eldest son came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And that man, </span>i.e., me, <span class="gemarra-regular">what will become of him </span>if you give all of your property to this woman? The father <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses: Go hide in Avar Yemin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a document <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the son, giving him the father’s property as a gift. Later, the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., the son, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., the wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>it either. The son did not acquire the property because it was a concealed gift.
The Gemara explains why the wife does not acquire it as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who observed </span>this incident <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed </span>that Rava invalidated the wife’s acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the concealed gift to his son <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration to the other </span>gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. There, </span>in the case of the woman and the son, <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter </span>is self-<span class="gemarra-regular">eviden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he wrote </span>a document signing over his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to her because of duress, </span>as she had told him that she would not marry him otherwise; <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, </span>in a typical case of giving one person a concealed gift and then giving a public gift to another, that is not the case. It is possible that it is simply <span class="gemarra-regular">amenable to him that </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., the one to whom he gave it publicly, <span class="gemarra-regular">should acquire </span>the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not amenable to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him that </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., the one to whom he gave it privately, <span class="gemarra-regular">should acquire </span>the gift. Consequently, an incorrect inference was drawn concerning Rava’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: 

Daf 41a

<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the status of a document detailing a gift that is <span class="gemarra-regular">with-out specificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as to whether the giver desired that it be publicized? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We are not concerned </span>that it may be a concealed gift, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: We are concerned. And </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Any possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not accompanied by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> explaining how the possessor became the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> How so? </span>If the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the possessor: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are you doing in my </span>land? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: I am in possession of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">because no person ever said anything to me </span>about my being here, i.e., he states no valid claim as to why he would be the owner of the land, his mere use <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
But if the possessor claimed: I am in possession of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">because you sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because you gave </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me as a gift,</span> or: Because <span class="gemarra-regular">your father sold it to me, </span>or: Because <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father gave it to me as a gift, </span>these are valid claims to ownership. In these cases, his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> And one who comes </span>to claim the land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on inheritanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not need a claim </span>explaining why his ancestors had a right to the land.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna need to say this? Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership absent a claim of ownership?
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the mishna to state this, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: That man </span>had actually <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased this land </span>that he possessed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he had a bill </span>of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it was lost. And the reason that he said </span>that he is in possession of the land because no person ever said anything to him, is that he <span class="gemarra-regular">thought: If I say </span>that the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sold me this land, </span>the court will <span class="gemarra-regular">say to me: Show </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">your bill </span>of sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>being that this may be the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say to him: Perhaps you had a bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lost. </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, </span>one would think that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a situation where the court should apply the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Open your mout</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the mute” </span>(Proverbs 31:8), meaning the court should advise a litigant of his possible claims, because perhaps he does not state them out of ignorance. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the court does not advance this claim on his behalf, and if he does not make the claim of his own violation, he does not establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the discussion that follows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara tells of a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A torrent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bideka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">swept </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan’s land, </span>removing the wall which marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Anan <span class="gemarra-regular">went back </span>and rebuilt <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall, </span>inadvertently placing it <span class="gemarra-regular">in his neighbor’s land. </span>Rav Anan <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>to ask him what he should do about it. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go return </span>the boundary to its prior position.
Rav Anan replied: Why should I return the boundary? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of this land? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: In accordance with whose </span>opinion are you claiming a right to the land? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who say: Any </span>taking of possession that is done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> immediately? </span>If so, your claim is not accepted since <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>opinion.
Rav Anan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">waiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> his ownership of this land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">came and assisted in </span>the building of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall with me? </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> Rav Anan: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an erroneous waiving</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since <span class="gemarra-regular">you yourself would not </span>have placed the wall there <span class="gemarra-regular">if you had known </span>that it was the wrong location for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as you did not know </span>that you were building it in the wrong location, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, he did not know. </span>Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he did not knowingly waive his ownership of his property.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A torrent </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">swept </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana’s field, </span>removing the wall that marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">went back </span>and rebuilt the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall, </span>inadvertently placing it <span class="gemarra-regular">in land that was not his. </span>

Daf 41b

Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yehuda. </span>Rav Kahana’s neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">brought two witnesses. One said: </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">entered two rows </span>into his neighbor’s land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one said: </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">entered three rows </span>into his neighbor’s land. Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two out of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>that your neighbor is claiming by moving the wall two rows into your property.
Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose</span> opinion are you ruling that the testimony of witnesses who contradict each other is valid? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to two sets of witnesses, where one </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that a litigant owes <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and one </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he owes <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a case, everyone agrees <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>two hundred <span class="gemarra-regular">includes one hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he is liable to pay one hundred.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what did </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one set </span>of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that a litigant owes <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he owes <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred; as</span> in such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">their testimony is divided, </span>and they do not combine to form a set of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred includes one hundred, </span>and they combine to form a set of witnesses. Rav Kahana assumed that Rav Yehuda based his ruling on Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s interpretation of the opinion of Beit Hillel.
Rav Kahana then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yehuda: How can you rely on this opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">But I can bring you a letter from the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Eretz Yisrael, stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, </span>and that in fact Beit Hillel also disqualify two witnesses in such a case. Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: I will accept that ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">when you will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> such a letter. Until then, I stand by my ruling.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who resided</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a loft in Kasht</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">four years. </span>At the end of that period, the prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the house came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">found him </span>there. The prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What do you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">want with this house </span>of mine? The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from so-and-so, who purchased it from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ḥiyya, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If you have witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who will testify <span class="gemarra-regular">that he, from whom you purchased </span>the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">resided in it, even </span>if there is testimony that he resided in it for only <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, I will establish it in your possession, but if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span> testimony to his having resided there then I will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish it in your possession, and it will revert back to its prior owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: I was sitting before my uncle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deḥavivi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Ḥiyya, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I said to him: But isn’t it common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to purchase </span>a house <span class="gemarra-regular">and sell </span>it immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">during the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">night? </span>It is possible that the seller purchased and sold the house without witnesses who saw him residing in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I saw that </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya’s <span class="gemarra-regular">opinion </span>was that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the claimant: The one who sold it to me <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased it from you in my presence, </span>this claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the possessor <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted </span>to, he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the prior owner of the house: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">stands to reason </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as </span>the mishna (41a) <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>In the case of land <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes as an inheritance, one is not required to make a claim </span>as to how the land came into his benefactor’s possession when one’s ownership of the land is challenged. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a claim that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need, but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does need proo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> that it had been in the possession of his ancestors.
The Gemara rejects the inference from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need proof and does not need a claim. </span>The only reason that the mishna mentions that he does not need a claim is to clarify that this does not fall into the category of a possession that is not accompanied by a claim. Therefore, one cannot infer from the ruling of that mishna what the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that although the inference from the mishna is correct, it is not relevant to this case, as the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer is different, since </span>he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not throw money </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">for nothing. </span>The fact that he purchased the house indicates that he must have ascertained that the seller had a right to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">was seen in </span>the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this sufficient proof that he had purchased the house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It is identical </span>to testimony that he had resided there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This does not constitute proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is apt to survey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">desayyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> land and</span> ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">not purchase </span>it.
§ The Gemara issues a ruling concerning the establishment of the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three buyers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">combin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to establish the presumption of ownership. If one purchased a field and sold it to another, who then sold it to a third party, and in total, the three of them worked and profited from the field for three years, the third one has established the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: And</span> this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only if they <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>purchased the land <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of sale. As a result of the bill of sale, the prior owner will know that it is not the case that each of them worked and profited from the field for only one year and abandoned it, which would explain why he did not bother to lodge a protest.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say that Rav holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but witnesses do not </span>generate <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity? But doesn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>and that field is later seized by the creditors of the seller, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">collects from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">liened propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that the seller had sold to others, to be reimbursed for his seized field? If not for the fact that the sale in the presence of witnesses generates publicity, those who later purchased land from the seller would not have been aware that the property they are purchasing is liened to the first buyer. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">buyers, </span>

Daf 42a

<span class="gemarra-regular">they caused their own los</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by not investigating whether there was a lien on the property that they intended to buy.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rav, </span>in fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that one can collect sold property by means of witnesses alone? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (175a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who lends money to another with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note collects </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that had been sold after the loan, if the debtor has no other property; but if one lent <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of witnesses </span>without a promissory note, he <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>his debt only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>as such has the authority to <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>the determination in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t Rav </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel both say: </span>One who is owed a debt due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract <span class="gemarra-regular">does not collect </span>liened property, <span class="gemarra-regular">not from the heirs </span>of the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from the buyers, </span>despite the fact that there are witnesses?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you raising a contradiction</span> from a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sale? </span>They are not comparable. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan, when </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows </span>money he <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows discreetly, in order that his property not be devalued, </span>as people will pay less for his property if they know that he is pressed for capital. Since a loan is issued discreetly, the presumption is that the buyers were unaware of the loan. Therefore, the creditor does not collect from sold property. By contrast, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sale, one who sells land sells</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">in publi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order that publicity be generated with regard to it. </span>Therefore, the cases of loans and sales are not comparable.
The Gemara continues the discussion of the establishment of the presumption of ownership by successive possessors. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land for one <span class="gemarra-regular">yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the son </span>who inherited it from him worked and profited from it for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">the father </span>worked and profited from the land for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">and the son </span>worked and profited from for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">the father </span>worked and profited from the land for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year and the son </span>worked and profited from it for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year, and the buyer, </span>who purchased it from the son, worked and profited from it for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer, </span>the transaction generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity? And </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:8): If one worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the father, </span>the prior owner, for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in the presence of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, </span>who then inherited it from the father, for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years; or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the father </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">and in the presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the son </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the father </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year and in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presence of the son </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year and in the presence of the buyer, </span>who purchased it from the son, for one <span class="gemarra-regular">year; this is </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> And if it enters your mind </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer, </span>the transaction generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity, there is no greater protest than this. </span>By selling his land to someone else, the son of the prior owner is clearly stating that it does not belong to the possessor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>That is not a contradiction, as <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sells his fields without specification. </span>The son of the prior owner sold his fields without clarifying which fields he was selling. Since he did not specify the field from which the possessor is profiting, the possessor had no reason to assume that this field was being sold and that he needed to hold on to his deed, and he establishes the presumption of ownership despite the sale. In a case where the son of the prior owner stated explicitly that he was selling the field in question, the sale would serve as his protest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Craftsme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who are in possession of items that they are repairing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sharecroppers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and stewards [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veha’apotropin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership with regard to property in their possession, as their possession is not indicative of ownership. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a man does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his wife’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and a wife does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to her husband’s property. And a father </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to a son’s property, and a son does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a father’s property. </span>A husband and wife, or son and father, use each other’s property freely. Possession is therefore not indicative of ownership.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that one establishes the presumption of ownership after profiting from the property for a certain duration, with the exception of the above people, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the property, which does, in some cases, serve as proof of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case where another person <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divided </span>their inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>there is one who <span class="gemarra-regular">takes possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a conver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> who died without heirs and his property is now ownerless, as soon as one <span class="gemarra-regular">locke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the door of the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">or fenced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or breached </span>its fence even <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">taking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession </span>of the property, and it effects acquisition. 

Daf 42b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s father and Levi taught: A partne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of property in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and, all the more so, </span>this inability applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as well. But <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel teaches: A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of property in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a partner </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel follows his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Shmuel says: Partners establish </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership with regard to the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">testify for each othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and become paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of their joint property with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to each other. </span>In terms of these issues, Shmuel considers partners to be independent parties.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba raises a contradiction to Rav Yehuda in the cave of Rav Zakkai’s house: Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partner has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership?<span class="gemarra-regular"> But doesn’t Shmuel say: A partner is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">enters </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as a sharecropper? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t that to say that a partner does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">enters all of </span>the field, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">enters half </span>of the field.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say it in this manne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say it in that manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> On the one hand, it is possible to explain that if he entered half of the field he establishes the presumption of ownership with regard to that half, but if he entered the entire field he is merely acting as a partner. On the other hand, one could explain that entering half of the field does not establish the presumption of ownership at all, while entering the entire field does establish it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina stated </span>a different resolution to the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both this and that </span>are referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">enters the entire </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>sufficient area to be subject to the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division. </span>In this case, his being in possession of the other half of the field as well, which belonged to his partner, establishes the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is not of </span>sufficient area to be subject to the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of division. </span>Since the property will not be divided but will remain co-owned, he is merely possessing it as a partner and does not establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara addresses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Shmuel says: A partner is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">enters </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission. What is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership in the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">partnership? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">A partner does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of property in his possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>Shmuel’s intent was <span class="gemarra-regular">to state that </span>a partner who proactively works to improve their mutual property <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that reaches shoulders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., when the produce that grew due to the efforts of the partner is fully grown and ripened and can be harvested and carried upon one’s shoulders. He is not considered as one who entered another’s field without permission and improved it, who collects only for his expenditures. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he planted trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in a field that is not commonly used for planting </span>trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>it is if he planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in a field that is commonly used for planting </span>trees.
The Gemara continues its discussion of Shmuel’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And testify for each other. </span>A partner may join another witness in testifying with regard to the fact that his partner owns a share of their field in order to counter the claim of a one who claims ownership of the field, and his testimony is not disqualified due to being biased. 

Daf 43a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is this so? Aren’t partners <span class="gemarra-regular">biased in their testimony</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they jointly own the property in question?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the partner who is testifying <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote to </span>the other partner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">legal </span>dealings <span class="gemarra-regular">or involvement with regard to this field, thereby </span>relinquishing his ownership of the field. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, what of it? But isn’t it taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: I do not have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">legal </span>dealings <span class="gemarra-regular">or involvement concerning this field,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or: I have no dealings with it, or: My hands are removed from it, has said nothing? </span>That is to say, these statements have no legal standing.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one testifying <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the other partner. Since relinquishing his share in this fashion is effective, his testimony is no longer biased. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">performed</span> an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition with </span>the one testifying, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it?</span> His testimony is still biased, as he is <span class="gemarra-regular">establishing </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">before his creditor. </span>Once he transferred his share to his partner, his creditor will now be able to collect from the property that he formerly co-owned, as a creditor can collect from property that a debtor once owned despite the fact that he has relinquished his ownership of it. Since his testimony enables him to repay his debt, it is biased.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a field to another </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarante</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify with regard to </span>ownership of that field <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">establishing </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">before his creditor.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one testifying <span class="gemarra-regular">assumes </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for </span>the field. Therefore, his testimony is not biased. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Responsibility with regard to whom? If we say </span>that he assumes <span class="gemarra-regular">general responsibility, </span>such that if anyone collects the field from his former partner for whatever reason, he is liable to compensate the partner, then <span class="gemarra-regular">all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more so </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable for him </span>that the field remain in his former partner’s possession, as if the claimant will be successful in obtaining the field, the witness will have to compensate the partner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring to a case where he assumes <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a loss <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes to</span> his former partner in the property <span class="gemarra-regular">resulting from </span>the field being seized by one of his creditors to collect payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>debts. He is, therefore, not an interested party, as in any event he owes the same debt, either to his creditor or to his partner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he removes himself from </span>the property by having the former partner acquire his share in it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it actually effective to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span> him, so that there is no longer a concern for biased testimony? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of a city whose Torah scroll was stolen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjudicated by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">people of that city, </span>as their testimony is biased? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is so </span>that relinquishing one’s share renders one as not biased, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let two of them remove themselves from </span>their share in the Torah scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the court can <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A Torah scroll is different, as it stands for </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">to listen </span>to the Torah reading from it. Since they are obligated to listen to the Torah reading, they stand to benefit from this Torah scroll even if they relinquish their ownership share in it, and their testimony is biased.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: Give one hundred dinars to the residents of my city, </span>the distribution of the funds is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjudicated by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">people of that city, </span>as their testimony is biased. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">remove themselves </span>from their share in the funds <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the court can <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the gift was for the purpose of procuring <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scroll, </span>and the same aforementioned reasoning applies.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: Give one hundred dinars to the poor </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">of my city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the distribution of the funds is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjudicated by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from </span>testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">people of that city, </span>as their testimony is biased. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand</span> the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor take </span>the money and the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges are </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>as interested parties? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: </span>The distribution of the funds is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjudicated by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor people of that city. And why </span>not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">remove themselves </span>from their share in the funds <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the court can <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the gift was for the purpose of procuring <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scroll,</span> and the same aforementioned reasoning applies. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if it is referring to money for purchasing a Torah scroll rather than money earmarked for charity, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">call </span>the recipients: <span class="gemarra-regular">Poor </span>people? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because everyone is poor with regard to a Torah scroll, </span>as it is very expensive.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to people who are <span class="gemarra-regular">literally poor, as it teaches. And </span>the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">poor people, whose </span>support is <span class="gemarra-regular">incumbent upon </span>all of the residents. Therefore, a gift to these poor people reduces their obligation, and all of their testimony is biased. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are the circumstances </span>in which this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states its ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum of charity that each resident is obligated to give is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed for them, let two of </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">give what is fixed for them </span>to give to the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the court can <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum is <span class="gemarra-regular">not fixed for them. </span>Therefore, this is not an option. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed for them. And </span>nevertheless, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">amenable to </span>the residents of the city that the poor receive a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">because once</span> there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for the poor people from this donation, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gain, </span>and it lightens the burden on all of the people of the city.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s statement concerning partners: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they become paid bailees </span>of their joint property with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">each other. </span>

Daf 43b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>are they liable as paid bailees? Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding accompanied by </span>employment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Since both partners are safeguarding each other’s property, they are both employed by each other, and they should therefore be exempt from the obligations of safeguarding. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>Shmuel is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says to </span>his partner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Safeguard for me today, and I will safeguard for you tomorrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In this circumstance, they are each the sole bailee at any given moment, and they do not receive the exemption from bailee payments for being employed by the owner.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a house to </span>another, or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a field to him, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify about it for </span>the buyer against a claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him,</span> and his testimony is biased. By contrast, if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cow to him, </span>or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cloak to him, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can testify about it for </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility</span> to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not upon him. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>that he cannot testify <span class="gemarra-regular">and what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>that he can? Why would one assume that in the first case he does bear responsibility, but not in the second?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: The first clause </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven, who robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sold it to Levi, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda comes and contests </span>Levi’s ownership, stating that it was actually his. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that Shimon cannot go </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">to testify for Levi, because</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable for </span>Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the field be <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>to Levi, so that he can later collect it from him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But once </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">testified that </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is Levi’s, how is he able to </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it from his </span>possession? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in his testimony: <span class="gemarra-regular">I know that this land is not Yehuda’s, </span>but he did not explicitly testify that it belonged to Levi. He is therefore able to later claim it is his and not Levi’s. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why should he testify that it does not belong to Yehuda? <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>by which he <span class="gemarra-regular">removes </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi, let him remove it from </span>the possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda. </span>It is not to his advantage to lie in order to establish it in the possession of Levi, and his testimony should not be considered biased.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">The second </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is amenable to me, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">more difficult than he </span>is, i.e., I prefer to litigate with Levi rather than with Yehuda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>instead: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">has witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> attesting to his ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Yehuda, also <span class="gemarra-regular">has witnesses </span>attesting to his ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sages said </span>that under such circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">the land should remain where it is. </span>That is to say, it should remain with the one currently in possession. If Yehuda were to be awarded the land, Shimon would not be able to remove the land from his possession despite having witnesses to support his claim, as Yehuda also has witnesses supporting his claim and would be in possession of the land. As a result of Shimon’s testimony, the land will be awarded to Levi, who has possession as a result of his purchase from Reuven. Then Shimon will be able to remove the land from Levi’s possession by proving that Reuven stole it from him. Therefore, Shimon’s testimony is biased. 

Daf 44a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the understanding of Rav Sheshet, that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is disqualifying one whose field was stolen from testifying on behalf of one who purchased the field from the robber, why is it necessary to discuss a case involving a buyer, when it would be simpler to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish it with regard to </span>testifying for the <span class="gemarra-regular">robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> himself?
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case involving a buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to teach the latter clause: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a cow to him, </span>or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cloak to him, </span>he can testify about it for the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in this clause, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>needs to discuss a case where the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>by the owners due to the robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> change in possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the sale, and the one who was robbed can no longer reclaim the stolen item. He is therefore no longer biased in his testimony and can testify for the one who purchased the item. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the latter clause, if the robber did <span class="gemarra-regular">not sell</span> it, in which case the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is returned to </span>the robbery victim, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>testify, as he prefers that the item be in the possession of the robber, so that he can recover it from him. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause as well</span> about a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause as well, </span>where there is despair and change in possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs of </span>recovering the item <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">despair of </span>being reimbursed for <span class="gemarra-regular">its value</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> While it is true that he lost his ownership of the item, he is still entitled to payment. Therefore, he is still biased in his testimony. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the robber died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case the robbery victim cannot collect even the value of the stolen item, and is no longer biased in his testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 111b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and feed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> it to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">children, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance, the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from paying </span>the victim of the robbery after their father’s death. Since he is no longer able to collect the value of the stolen item, he is not biased in his testimony and can testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>testifying for the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heir? </span>This would demonstrate the contrast that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> wanted to teach. In the case of a stolen field, which always must be returned to its owner, the robbery victim is biased in his testimony because the field can be recovered. Therefore, it is in his interest to establish that it is in the possession of the robber’s heirs. In the case of movable property, which cannot be recovered after the death of the robber, he is not biased in his testimony.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that the transfer of an item to the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an hei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span>the transfer of an item to the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer, </span>but is viewed as an extension of the possession of the legator. According to this opinion, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> did not establish its case with regard to the robber’s heir, as the robbery victim would be able to recover the item, and would be considered biased in his testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>that the transfer of an item to the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an heir </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the transfer of an item to the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a buyer, </span>and the item is not recoverable in either case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can be said </span>to explain why the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not state its case with regard to an heir?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>this explanation was <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult for Abaye </span>to understand, as according to Rav Sheshet’s explanation, is it accurate to state, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does, that the distinction exists between the cases of land and movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in the first clause the financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the land is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him, and </span>in the latter clause the financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the movable property is <span class="gemarra-regular">not upon him? </span>That is not the crucial distinction. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>taught instead that the difference is: Here he cannot testify <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the stolen field <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to him, and </span>here he can testify because the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not return to him.</span>
The Gemara offers a new explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>explain instead <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Ravin bar Shmuel, as Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a field to another </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee </span>that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify with regard to </span>ownership of that field <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">establishing </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">before his creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies this by noting: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house or a field. But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow or a cloak, </span>he is not biased in his testimony, and can testify on behalf of the buyer. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not necessary </span>to say that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>

Daf 44b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where he sold a cow or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, where it is not liened to </span>the creditor. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span> for this? It is because these items <span class="gemarra-regular">are movable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property, and movable property is not liened to a creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And even though </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote to </span>the creditor that he can collect the debt even <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak that is on his shoulders,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is as is </span>and in the possession of the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not as is, </span>since it is in the possession of the buyer, then <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the creditor cannot collect from movable property. Therefore, the debtor can testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But even </span>in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">set </span>the cow or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">aside </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repayment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apoteiki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>collect from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava says:</span> If a master <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside his slave </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repaymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him, </span>the master’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor collects </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds from the sale of the slave. But if one set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox or his donkey </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repaymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor does not collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds of the sale of the ox or the donkey.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this distinction? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>setting aside of the slave as designated repayment generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity, and that </span>setting aside of the ox or donkey as designated repayment does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>generate <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity. </span>Therefore, when the slave had been set aside as designated repayment, the buyer would have been aware of this. Since he bought the slave while having this knowledge, the slave can be seized from him by the seller’s creditor. By contrast, the buyer of the cow or cloak would not have been aware that it had been set aside as designated repayment, so the seller’s creditor cannot seize it from him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the creditor, not for him to own, but for him to have a lien on the movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">means of, </span>i.e., together with, an acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rabba said: If </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred movable property to </span>the creditor as liened property <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>an acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the land </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, </span>i.e., a lien is created with regard to both. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda said: And that is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote to </span>the creditor: This lien is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like a transaction with inconclusive consent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ke’asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not effect acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not like the template [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ketofesa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for documents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are not actually used to collect debts. Rather, it is a legally binding document.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the debtor had <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>the movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">and immediately sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it, and there was no opportunity for him to have it become liened to a creditor. Therefore, there is no possibility of his being biased in his testimony due to a desire to repay his debt.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps it is </span>a case in which the debtor wrote to the creditor: I will repay you even from <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the future, which would presumably mean that the creditor can collect from the buyer even though the debtor purchased the item after taking the loan. From the fact that this is not a concern, do <span class="gemarra-regular">you learn from it </span>that even if the debtor wrote: I will repay you even from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the future, and he then <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased and sold </span>property or <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased and bequeathed </span>it, that which he purchases is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liened </span>to his creditor? This would seem to settle what is otherwise assumed to be an unresolved question.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>one need not reach that conclusion, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses say: We know about this </span>one who sold these items <span class="gemarra-regular">that he never had </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, it cannot be that the creditor acquired a lien on the movable property by means of an acquisition of land.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Pappa say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the Sages said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to another without a guarantee, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a creditor came and repossessed it, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot return to </span>the seller, i.e. the debtor, who sold him the field, to claim reimbursement; but if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">found that </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the seller’s in the first place, the buyer can <span class="gemarra-regular">return to </span>the seller to claim reimbursement. In this case, if the claimant establishes that the cow or cloak is his and was not the seller’s, the buyer will be able to claim reimbursement. The seller is therefore biased in his testimony, and should not be able to testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where the buyer admits that he <span class="gemarra-regular">recognizes that this</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring of </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey, </span>and will not claim in court that the seller had no right to sell it.
The Gemara returns to the statement of Rav Pappa and comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in contrast to the opinion of Rav Pappa, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: Even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">found that </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>the seller’s, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot return to </span>the seller to claim reimbursement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the seller can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the buyer: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">I sold it to you without a guarantee, </span>i.e., so that if it is taken from you, I will not bear liability.
§ The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement, in order to examine <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee </span>that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify with regard to </span>ownership of that field <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">establishing </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">before his creditor. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 

Daf 45a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">has other land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that he did not sell, in addition to the field that he sold with regard to which he currently wishes to testify, his creditor will <span class="gemarra-regular">go after it, </span>and collect from that land. In that case, he is not biased in his testimony concerning the field that he sold. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have other land, what difference does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it make to him </span>if the buyer is unable to keep the land? In any event the creditor cannot collect directly from the seller.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Shmuel is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have other land, </span>and the reason that he is nevertheless biased in his testimony is that he wants his creditors to be able to collect the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">because he says </span>to himself that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncomfortable for him to b</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the category of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The wicked borrows, and pays not” </span>(Psalms 37:21).
The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is also </span>in the category of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The wicked borrows, and pays not” </span>(Psalms 37:21) <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the other </span>one, to whom he sold the land. He took money from the buyer, who did not receive anything in exchange, as the land was seized from him. The Gemara answers: He is not concerned about his behavior toward the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">For this </span>very reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I sold it to you without a guarantee, </span>so that if it would be seized from you I would not be liable.
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava announced, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>who announced: All <span class="gemarra-regular">those who ascend </span>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">those who descend </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia should be aware of the following: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">this Jew who sold</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a donkey to another Jew, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile came and seized it from him, </span>claiming that it was really his, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller should <span class="gemarra-regular">rescue [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dimfatzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it from </span>the gentile or reimburse the buyer.
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not recognize that this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring of </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey, </span>and it is possible that the gentile’s claim is true. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">recognizes that this is</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring of </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey, </span>then the seller is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> liable to reimburse him. It is clear that the gentile’s claim is false, so the seller bears no responsibility for the buyer’s loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where the gentile did <span class="gemarra-regular">not seize it and the saddl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">seized it and the saddle </span>with it, it is clear that the gentile is a robber, and it is assumed that there is no validity to his claim with regard to the donkey. Therefore, the seller is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable to reimburse him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: Even if there are not any of thes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> factors, the seller is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable to reimburse him. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reasoning </span>for this? It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that an ordinary gentile is an extortionist</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so it is assumed that the donkey did indeed belong to the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</span> (Psalms 144:8).
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the statement of Shmuel (42b): <span class="gemarra-regular">A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of the property in his possession, but a partner has the ability to establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses. But </span>if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to say to </span>the one who claims to be the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">These matters never occurred, </span>i.e., you did not give me this item but it was mine to begin with, and he would keep possession of the item with that claim, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: It is purchased </span>by me from you, and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the owner transferred the item to the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses as well, </span>he should be deemed credible. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I returned </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>and he would be exempt from payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: It is purchased </span>by me from you, and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that

Daf 45b

in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with another in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">need not return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses? </span>If that were to be so, the craftsman could claim that he had returned it to the owner, even though there are no witnesses. That possibility should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind. Rather, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with another in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses,</span> the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">must return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses. </span>Therefore, the craftsman could not have claimed that he returned it to the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raises an objection </span>to Rabba’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:6): There is a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of a craftsman, or his cloak in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of a launderer, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">nature of its </span>presence <span class="gemarra-regular">in your </span>possession? If the craftsman or launderer replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">You sold me </span>the slave or cloak, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You gave </span>the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">to me as a gift, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not said anything, </span>and must return it, since a craftsman does not establish the presumption of ownership. But if the craftsman or launderer replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">You said in my presence to </span>someone else <span class="gemarra-regular">to sell </span>the slave or cloak to him <span class="gemarra-regular">or to give </span>the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>i.e., to sell or give the slave or cloak to the craftsman or launderer himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is valid.</span>
Before Abaya raises his objection, he first clarifies the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>that the craftsman is not deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>that he is?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: The latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from the possession of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and not from the possession of the craftsman, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">You said in my presence to </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">to sell </span>the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">or to give </span>the slave or cloak to me <span class="gemarra-regular">as gift. </span>This person is deemed credible despite acknowledging that he received it from the craftsman, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if he had wanted </span>to, he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the item: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased </span>the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">from you. </span>As this third party is not a craftsman, he is able to establish the presumption of ownership through possession and would be deemed credible. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him as well: You said to him in my presence to sell </span>the slave or cloak, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is valid, and he is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
After having clarified the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Abaye presents his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the case where a craftsman is not deemed credible is where the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>the slave or cloak in the possession of the craftsman. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are witnesses </span>to the fact that the owner gave the slave or cloak to the craftsman for training or cleaning, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need for the owner to have <span class="gemarra-regular">seen </span>them in the craftsman’s possession? Let the owner simply <span class="gemarra-regular">bring witnesses and take </span>back his slave or cloak. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses, and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>the slave or cloak in the craftsman’s possession, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may seize </span>the slave or cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case? </span>This contradicts Rabba’s statement that the decisive factor is whether the transfer took place in the presence of witnesses.
Rabba answers this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>that is not the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are witnesses, and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that he may seize the slave or cloak only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> it currently in the possession of the craftsman. But if there are no witnesses that it is currently in his possession, he would be deemed credible if he were to claim that he purchased the slave or cloak from the owner, as he could have claimed that he returned the slave or cloak.
Abaye asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But you are </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with another in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">must return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses.</span> Therefore, if it was given to the craftsman in the presence of witnesses, he would not have the ability to make a more advantageous claim [<span class="it-text">miggo</span>] that he returned it. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">I retracted </span>that opinion and hold that he may return it even when not in the presence of witnesses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to support </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives his cloak to a craftsman, </span>and then the <span class="gemarra-regular">craftsman says: You fixed tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> dinars as <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one, </span>the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I fixed </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>dinar as <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>payment, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">so long as </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that the cloak is in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">craftsman, </span>it is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner to bring proof </span>that the fee was one dinar. If the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the cloak back <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>then there are two scenarios: If the claim is lodged <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., on the day of the cloak’s return, then the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath and receives </span>the two dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">time passed, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> proof rests upon the claimant, </span>and the craftsman would need to bring proof that the fee was two dinars.
Rava continues with an analysis of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumstances </span>of the case discussed in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are witnesses </span>who saw the transfer of the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us see what the witnesses say </span>about the fee, as they presumably heard the details of the arrangement. 

Daf 46a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses </span>to the transfer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">craftsman</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible? Since if he had wanted </span>to he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is purchased </span>and that is why it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible with regard to </span>his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">about his fee as well. </span>This supports the ruling of Rabba that if there are no witnesses, the craftsman is deemed credible if he says that the item belongs to him.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually, </span>perhaps the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses </span>to the transfer, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> it is specifically referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not see </span>the cloak in the possession of the craftsman, who could consequently deny ever having received it from the owner. Therefore, it is not a proof in support of the ruling of Rabba that the craftsman would be deemed credible even if there are witnesses that it is currently in his possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>to Rabba’s ruling from Shmuel’s paraphrase of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of property in his possession. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman who does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership,<span class="gemarra-regular"> but another </span>person in similar circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which this would apply? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are witnesses </span>that the person in question received the item from another, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is it that <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, when there are witnesses that he received this item as a deposit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses, and </span>yet, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. This indicates that a craftsman does not establish the presumption of ownership under any circumstances, contrary to the ruling of Rabba. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and his ruling is rejected.
§ The Gemara discusses another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to the giving of an item to a craftsman. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils were </span>mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">switched with </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils in the house of a craftsman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>one who received the wrong utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use them until </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span>one, whose utensils he received, <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and takes his. </span>But if his utensils and another’s utensils were mistakenly switched <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house of mournin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in a house of </span>a wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast, this </span>one who took the wrong utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">may not use them </span>in the interim, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span>one, whose utensils he took, <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and takes his. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>where he may use the utensils, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>where he may not?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: I was sitting before my uncle, </span>Rav Ḥiyya, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">to me: And is a person not likely to say to the craftsman: Sell my cloak for me </span>after you finish repairing it? It is possible that the craftsman mistakenly sold the utensils of another client instead, and gave to that other client the utensils that should have been sold. Since the owner of these utensils received the money from the sale of the other client’s utensils, the craftsman has a right to give the remaining utensils to the other client in the interim. This reasoning does not apply in the case of the house of mourning or a wedding feast, where one simply took utensils belonging to another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Naḥman, said: They taught </span>that it is permitted to use the utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>gave them to his customer, as in that case, the above reasoning applies. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the craftsman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife or children </span>gave them to him, the customer may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>use the utensils, as it is likely that they were given to him in error. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even </span>if the craftsman himself gave the utensils to his customer, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that it is permitted for him to use them <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him, for example: I am returning <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloak, without specification. But </span>if the craftsman said to him: I am returning <span class="gemarra-regular">your cloak, </span>then he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>use it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is not his cloak, </span>and clearly it was given to him in error.
§ The Gemara presents another statement with regard to craftsmen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">I will show you what the swindlers of Pumbedit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do. </span>There was a case where the owner of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>a craftsman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">my cloak [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sarbelai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that I gave you to repair, and the craftsman replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">These matters never occurred. </span>The owner responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">But I have witnesses who saw it in your </span>possession. The craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That was a different </span>cloak that they saw. The witnesses are uncertain as to whether it was really his cloak. The owner then said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring it out and we will see it, </span>so as to determine whose it is. The craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">In truth, I will not bring it out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as you have no valid claim to the cloak and I am not willing to show you another’s property. This is the trickery to which Abaye referred, as it is not a sincere response, and the craftsman merely wishes to keep the cloak.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span> to Abaye: The craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying well to </span>the owner, and his claim will be accepted, 

Daf 46b

as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in the earlier <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the owner has a valid claim only when he, and witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>his cloak in the possession of the launderer and can definitively identify it. He cannot state a claim based on the mere possibility that it is his. This validates the claim of the craftsmen of Pumbedita.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: And if </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is clever, he will render </span>the situation into one of his having <span class="gemarra-regular">seen</span> his cloak, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the owner can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the craftsman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>are you <span class="gemarra-regular">holding it? Is it not due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is </span>money of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours with me,</span> and you are using the cloak as a means of collecting the debt that I owe you? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now bring out </span>my cloak before the appraisers <span class="gemarra-regular">and they will appraise its </span>value, and then <span class="gemarra-regular">you take </span>what is rightfully <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, and I will take </span>what is rightfully <span class="gemarra-regular">mine.</span> When the craftsman presents the cloak, the ruling will change, as the owner will have seen the cloak. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: </span>If the craftsman is clever, he <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not need your appraisal, </span>as the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier ones who preceded you already appraised it </span>and determined that its value does not exceed that of your debt to me.
§ The Gemara discusses a ruling that it paraphrases from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A sharecropper does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership of property in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>not? Isn’t it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">until that time, </span>while he was definitely working as a sharecropper, he consumed only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the produce of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now, </span>for the past three years, he consumed <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>its produce? He should be able to establish the presumption of ownership by consuming more produce than a sharecropper does. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The ruling of the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to family sharecroppers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This type of sharecropper, who works for a family for many years, gathers all of the produce into his property, and then returns the landowner’s share. Therefore, his collecting all of the produce into his property does not establish the presumption of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: A sharecropper who installed </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">sharecropper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his place has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>to see <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>unknown <span class="gemarra-regular">sharecroppers </span>have been <span class="gemarra-regular">installed in his land and </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">silent. </span>If the prior owner did not lodge a protest, it indicates that the sharecropper is the owner of the land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A sharecropper who divided among </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">sharecropper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership by that act. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason? </span>It is that one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the landowner <span class="gemarra-regular">merely appointed him </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">an administrator [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">harmanya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and there is no indication that he is acting as an owner.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda sent</span> this message <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov: Our teacher, instruct us. Can a sharecropper testify </span>with regard to the ownership of a field of which he is a sharecropper, <span class="gemarra-regular">or can he not testify, </span>as he is biased in his testimony? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was sitting before </span>Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is what Shmuel said: A sharecropper can testify</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a sharecropper <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify?</span>
Rav Yosef answered: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that he cannot testify, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the land. </span>Therefore, he is biased in his testimony, as, if the current owner will lose possession of the land, the sharecropper will lose his right to consume the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>statement of Shmuel that he can testify is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the land, </span>and he is not biased in his testimony.
§ The Gemara presents the word <span class="it-text">Amalek</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the cases discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. It stands for: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>guarantor [<span class="it-text">arev</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>creditor [<span class="it-text">malve</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>buyer [<span class="it-text">loke’aḥ</span>]; <span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>unconditional guarantor [<span class="it-text">kablan</span>].
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A guarantor can testify for </span>the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">the debto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that the latter owns a particular parcel of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has other lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from which the creditor can collect the debt. Otherwise, he is biased in his testimony, as the creditor could collect from him if the debtor were to lose ownership of this land. <span class="gemarra-regular">A creditor can testify for </span>the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">the debtor </span>that the latter owns a particular parcel of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has other land </span>from which the creditor can collect. Otherwise, he is biased in his testimony, as this land is the only land available for collection.
Similarly, if two people purchase land from one seller, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first buye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can testif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the benefit of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second buyer </span>if someone else were to claim that the land was his, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the second buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has other land </span>that he purchased from the same seller either concurrent with or subsequent to the first buyer’s purchase of the land in question. A creditor of the seller can collect a debt from the land that the seller sold most recently. Therefore, if the second buyer purchased only the land in question from the seller, the first buyer is biased in his testimony, as the second buyer’s ownership of the land prevents the creditor from collecting a debt from the land from the first buyer. 

Daf 47a

With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kablan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from whom the creditor can collect even if the debtor is able to repay the loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">some say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">can testify </span>on behalf of the debtor if the latter owns other land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify </span>even if the debtor owns other land. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">can testify </span>because he is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a guarantor, and some say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot testify, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable for him that both </span>fields <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the debtor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that when a creditor comes </span>to collect the debt, he will <span class="gemarra-regular">take what he wants, </span>and not collect from the unconditional guarantor.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a craftsman has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">A sharecropper does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of a sharecropper has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. Both <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of a robber do not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of a robber has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>under which there is a distinction between the sons of the craftsman and the sharecropper and the son of the robber? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">come</span> to court <span class="gemarra-regular">with the claim </span>that the item in question <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to their fathers, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even these </span>sons of the craftsman and the sharecropper should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be able to establish the presumption of ownership, since their claims are based on ownership by those who cannot establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not come </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">with the claim </span>that the item in question <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to their fathers,</span> but that they own the item in their own right, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of a robber </span>should be able to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this distinction in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses say: </span>The prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted to </span>their father <span class="gemarra-regular">in our presenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that the property was the father’s and not stolen. The Gemara explains: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>the sons of the craftsman and sharecropper, it <span class="gemarra-regular">can be said </span>that the sons <span class="gemarra-regular">are saying the truth, </span>as their claim is substantiated by the testimony of the admission. But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, the son of the robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>this, the son is <span class="gemarra-regular">still not deemed credible, in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana said: If </span>the prior owner would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robber, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">would have brought him and his donkey to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">taskmaster [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leshaḥvar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning he would have caused him great difficulties. As a robber is assumed to be a ruffian, it is likely that the prior owner admitted this because he was intimidated, and not because the statement was true, so there is no evidence to support the claim of the robber’s son.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times when even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> What are the circumstances </span>under which this is so? This is so, for example, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">comes</span> to court <span class="gemarra-regular">with the claim </span>that the item in question <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to his father’s father. </span>Since his claim is based on its having belonged to one who did not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership, he too is unable to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>under which one is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as where it is established </span>that he is in possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through robbery. And Rav Ḥisda says: </span>Not only in a case where there is knowledge about this specific field, but even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>one where he is a member <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">household of so-and-so, </span>a certain known criminal family at the time <span class="gemarra-regular">who kill people over monetary matters. </span>Since people would be afraid to lodge a protest against them, members of this family cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to any land.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: A craftsman does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">descended from his </span>position of <span class="gemarra-regular">craftsmanshi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> and no longer works at that craft, then he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership with regard to items related to his former craft. <span class="gemarra-regular">A sharecropper does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">descended from his </span>position as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sharecropper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership with regard to land that he works and from which he profits for three years. A son does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to his father’s property, nor a wife with regard to her husband’s property. But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a son who separate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> himself from his father’s finances, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a woman who became divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are like other people </span>with regard to this property, and have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, it was necessary </span>to state that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">separated</span> himself establishes the presumption of ownership. If the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> had not stated this, it would <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that the father <span class="gemarra-regular">forgave </span>the unauthorized use of his land <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span> his son, and did not lodge a protest despite the fact that the land did not belong to the son. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so, and that the son does establish the presumption of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">woman who became divorced, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that she has no relationship with her ex-husband, so why is it necessary for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to teach that she is able to establish the presumption of ownership? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to teach that she does not establish the presumption of ownership

Daf 47b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where there is uncertainty whether <span class="gemarra-regular">she is divorced or </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">she is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not divorced, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Zeira. As Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Wherever the Sages said </span>with regard to a woman that there is uncertainty whether <span class="gemarra-regular">she is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divorced or </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">she is not divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her husband </span>is still <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated with regard to her sustenance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One might have thought that since she still has some right to her husband’s property, insofar as he still has an obligation with regard to her sustenance he would not lodge a protest if she used his land without his authorization. It is therefore necessary to clarify that this is not so, and she has the ability to establish the presumption of ownership in her husband’s property.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said to me </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the types of people who do not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they bring proo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> by means of a document or witnesses that a field belongs to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">their proof is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">proof and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">places</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">field in their possession. </span>But if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber who brings proof </span>that a field is his, <span class="gemarra-regular">his proof is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">proof, and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not place </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">field in his possession. </span>This is due to a concern that the proof was obtained through illegitimate means.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us? We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 55b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Sicarius [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sikarikon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a violent gentile who had extorted the field from its owner with threats, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> afterward one <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and purchased </span>the same field <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, his purchase is void, </span>as the owner of the field can say that he did not actually intend to sell him the field. This teaches that a purchase following a robbery is invalid, despite the existence of documents or testimony, rendering the statement of Rav Huna superfluous.
The Gemara answers: Rav Huna’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude that which Rav </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav says: They taught </span>that the purchase of a field from the prior owner after one purchased it from a Sicarius is void <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> when the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer at the time of the sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go take possession and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the field, but did not write a document. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the transaction was performed along <span class="gemarra-regular">with a document </span>being given, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the field.
Therefore, Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he rules <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He does not acquire </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the transaction was performed along <span class="gemarra-regular">with a document </span>being given, <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a property guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a document that states that if the property is seized by the seller’s creditor, the seller will reimburse the buyer for his loss. Writing such a document indicates that it is a sincere transaction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Beiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concludes that </span>discussion of the statement of Rav Huna, that a robber does not retain possession of the field even if he brings proof of the transaction, with a comment <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Naḥman: </span>The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have </span>rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>that he paid for the land, and the owner has to reimburse him. <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that the robber is reimbursed <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses said: </span>The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">counted </span>out the money <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the owner and gave it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him in our presence; but </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses said: </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted to </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">in our presence </span>that he received payment, then the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>reimbursed, as the admission may have been made under duress. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana, who says: If </span>the owner would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted to </span>the robber that he received payment, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">would have brought him and his donkey to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">taskmaster.</span>
§ Apropos transactions performed under duress, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>If one was <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended, </span>e.g., from a tree, and thereby coerced to sell a certain item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is valid. What is the reason? </span>The Gemara suggests that it is because <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever a person sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were it not </span>for the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">compelled </span>by his need for money, he <span class="gemarra-regular">would not sell </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even so, his sale is valid. </span>This indicates that a transaction performed under duress is valid. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps duress </span>that results <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>needs, such as his need for money, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from duress </span>that results <span class="gemarra-regular">from another, </span>as in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the basis for Rav Huna’s ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 48a

With regard to one who pledges to bring a burnt-offering, the verse states: “If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall offer it </span>a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, according to his will, before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:3). The seemingly superfluous phrase “he shall offer it” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that they </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">coerce him </span>to bring the offering. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that it can be offered entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will, </span>by taking it from his possession and sacrificing it. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “According to his will” </span>(Leviticus 1:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>texts be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">They coerce him </span>with various punishments <span class="gemarra-regular">until he says: I want </span>to bring the offering. This seems to prove that consent resulting from coercion is considered to be valid consent. Perhaps this principle can apply to acquisition, as a source for Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps there it is different, since he is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">amenable to </span>achieving <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>despite his earlier statement to the contrary. <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>prove Rav Huna’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of a mishna (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 21a): <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly you find </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with bills of divorce, </span>that when the court rules that he must divorce his wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">they coerce hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until he says: I want </span>to divorce my wife.
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps there it is different, because it is a mitzva to listen to the statement of the Sages. </span>The assumption is that when he is required by the court to divorce his wife, his real desire is to perform the mitzva of listening to the Sages, and therefore he actually wants to divorce her. This does not apply to the case of a transaction performed under duress. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Huna’s ruling does not have a source in a mishna or <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>based on <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning: By means of his being coerced, </span>the seller then willingly <span class="gemarra-regular">decides </span>to sell the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and transfers </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda raises an objection</span> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 88b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce that </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">was compelle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by the court to write and give his wife, if he was compelled <span class="gemarra-regular">by a Jewish </span>court it is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid, but </span>if he was compelled <span class="gemarra-regular">by gentiles </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid. And with regard to gentiles, they may beat him </span>at the request of the Jewish court <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: Do what the Jews are telling you, </span>and the divorce would then be valid. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>is a bill of divorce compelled by a gentile court invalid? <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">as a result of his coercion, </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">decides </span>to do what the court says <span class="gemarra-regular">and divorces</span> her.
The Gemara answers: In fact that reasoning is correct, as for this reason <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it stated with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to that </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya says: By Torah law </span>a bill of divorce that the husband was compelled to give, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he was compelled <span class="gemarra-regular">by gentiles, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And what is the reason </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that if it is compelled <span class="gemarra-regular">by gentiles </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that each and every </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">will not go and </span>through temptation or bribery <span class="gemarra-regular">depend on a gentile </span>to compel her husband to divorce her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">release herself from her husband </span>illegitimately.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna raises an objection </span>to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 55b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Sicarius and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and purchased </span>the same field <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, his purchase is void, </span>as the prior owner of the field can say that he did not actually intend to sell the field to this buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>is the sale invalid? <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">being coerced, </span>the seller then willingly <span class="gemarra-regular">decides </span>to sell the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and transfers </span>it.
The Gemara answers: In fact that reasoning is correct, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>that the purchase from the prior owner after the purchase from a Sicarius is void <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> when the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer at the time of the sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go take possession and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the field, but did not write a bill of sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the transaction was performed along <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bill </span>of sale being given, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the field.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Shmuel, who says: He does not acquire </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the transaction was performed along <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bill </span>of sale being given, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can be said? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel concedes </span>that the sale is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gave money </span>for the field even though the owner sold it under duress, as is the case in the ruling of Rav Huna.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Beivai, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concludes that </span>statement of Rav Huna with a comment <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Naḥman: </span>The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he does have </span>rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>that he paid for the land, and the owner has to reimburse him, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be said? </span>Rav Beivai, who is referring to a case where there was a payment, as the robber is being reimbursed, seems to hold that the sale is invalid even where the robber paid for the field. The Gemara answers: The statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai is an </span>amoraic <span class="gemarra-regular">statement, </span>not a citation of a tannaitic ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Huna, </span>who is also an <span class="it-text">amora</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hold </span>in accordance with that amoraic <span class="gemarra-regular">statement.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that if one was <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>and thereby coerced to sell a certain item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is valid. And we said </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span>

Daf 48b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the seller was compelled to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">an unspecified field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he had a choice as to which field to sell, the presumption is that he sold it sincerely. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case where the one coercing him specified <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">field </span>to be sold, the sale is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid, as the seller did not decide freely on any aspect of the sale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And even in </span>a case where the one coercing him specified <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">field </span>to be sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that the sale is invalid <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not count [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">artzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> for the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did count </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>then we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that the sale is invalid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>that the sale is invalid in the case of a specified field when money was not counted <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">had no </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">to avoid </span>the coercion. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>a way <span class="gemarra-regular">to avoid </span>the coercion and did not avoid it, then we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that the sale is invalid.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in all of </span>these cases is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the sale is valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a specified field. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>forced to accept betrothal <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a specified field, </span>as a specific man is performing the betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Ameimar says: </span>If a man <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">and betrothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> her, <span class="gemarra-regular">his betrothal is valid, </span>despite the fact that she was coerced.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>who was forced to accept betrothal, the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal is certainly not </span>valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">acted improperly; consequently, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">acted improperly with him, and the Sages expropriated her betrothal from him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he betrothed </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">with money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is possible to say that the Sages expropriated from the possession of its owner the money used for the betrothal, resulting in a retroactive cancellation of the betrothal. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he betrothed </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of sexual intercourse, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Sages deemed his sexual intercourse </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">licentious sexual intercourse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not create a bond of betrothal.
§ The Gemara relates: Someone named <span class="gemarra-regular">Tavi suspended </span>another person named <span class="gemarra-regular">Pafi on a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kinar</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>compelled him to <span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>his field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana signed </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>Pafi’s preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration </span>nullifying the sale (see 40b) <span class="gemarra-regular">and on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of sale [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ashkalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">one who signed on </span>the preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaratio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> acted <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">signing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who signed on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of sale </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">signing.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way you </span>look at it, Rav Huna’s statement is problematic. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration </span>is valid, then there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span> place for <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of sale. And if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of sale </span>is valid, then there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>place for a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration. </span>How can Rav Huna commend signing on both of these mutually exclusive documents? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">not for </span>his also having signed the preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who signed on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of sale </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">signing. </span>In this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rav Huna says: </span>If one was <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>and thereby coerced to sell a certain item <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is valid.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so </span>that Rabba bar bar Ḥana can, by means of the preemptive declaration, invalidate the bill of sale that he himself signed? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses who said: Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a false promissory note given by one person to another, trusting that he will not make use of it until there is an actual loan, 

Daf 49a

they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not deemed credible. </span>And similarly, witnesses who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>accompanied by a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration, are not deemed credible. </span>They cannot negate the testimony of the document that they themselves signed by claiming that there had been a preemptive declaration. Similarly, how could Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s signing of the preemptive declaration override his signing the bill of sale?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That matter </span>of witnesses not being deemed credible to nullify a document applies only when the witnesses attempt to nullify the document by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oral </span>declaration, <span class="gemarra-regular">as an oral </span>declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot come and weaken </span>a written <span class="gemarra-regular">document. But </span>if the witnesses attempt to nullify the bill of sale by means of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">document, </span>e.g., by signing the preemptive declaration, then this preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">document </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">come and weaken </span>a written <span class="gemarra-regular">document, </span>in this case, the bill of sale.
The Gemara returns to discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: Rav Naḥman says </span>that witnesses who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not deemed credible. </span>And similarly, witnesses who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>accompanied by a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration, are not deemed credible.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Mar bar Rav Ashi says </span>that witnesses who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust, are not deemed credible; </span>but witnesses who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our statement </span>that we signed <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>accompanied by a preemptive <span class="gemarra-regular">declaration, are deemed credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason </span>for the difference between the cases? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>document that was accompanied by a preemptive declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">may be written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is merely written under duress, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that </span>document of trust <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be written, </span>as it is a false document. Testifying that they wrote it is self-incriminating, and the witnesses are not deemed credible to incriminate themselves.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a man does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to his wife’s propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and a wife does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to her husband’s property. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? Since he has </span>the right <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>enjoy <span class="gemarra-regular">the profits </span>of her property while they are married, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> known <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is only <span class="gemarra-regular">enjoying the profits </span>and that he has no claim to the field itself. On what grounds, then, would he establish the presumption of ownership?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote to </span>his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not have any legal </span>dealings <span class="gemarra-regular">or involvement with your property, </span>i.e., he forfeits his right to enjoy the profits of her property, and therefore if he subsequently did enjoy the profits of her field, one might assume that it is because he acquired the land from her. It was therefore necessary for the mishna to teach that this does not indicate that he owns the land, since it is possible that she does not prevent him from enjoying the profits, due to their relationship.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to her, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? And isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to another: I do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">legal </span>dealings <span class="gemarra-regular">or involvement concerning this field, or: I have no dealings with it, or: My hands are removed from it, has not said anything. </span>That is to say, these statements have no legal standing.
The scholars <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yannai said </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this: The mishna </span>states its ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>this formulation <span class="gemarra-regular">to her while she is still </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed, </span>before he had any rights to her property. Therefore, he is able to prevent his rights from taking effect after the marriage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana says: </span>

Daf 49b

With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance that comes to a person from another place, </span>i.e., an inheritance one will receive in the future, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person can make a condition about it </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will not inherit it, </span>since one can waive his future rights to property that is not currently his. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who says: I do not want </span>to avail myself <span class="gemarra-regular">of an ordinance of the Sages such as this </span>one that was instituted for my benefit, one <span class="gemarra-regular">listens to him.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">Such as this </span>one? The Gemara explains: Rava is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, </span>who said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>a certain ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: A woman can sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to her husband: I will not be sustained </span>by you and, in turn, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not work, </span>i.e., you will not keep my earnings. The Sages instituted that a husband must provide sustenance for his wife, and in exchange is entitled to her wages. Since this was instituted for the benefit of wives, the wife is able to opt out of this arrangement. Similarly, the husband may waive his rights to the profits from his wife’s land. It is in such a circumstance that the mishna rules that even if he relinquished his rights, he does not establish the presumption of ownership by enjoying the profits.
§ The mishna teaches that a husband does not establish the presumption of ownership of his wife’s field by enjoying its profits. The Gemara suggests: By inference, the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>that he purchased the field from his wife or received it as a gift from her and consequently be regarded as the owner of the field. The Gemara asks: Why is this proof decisive? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let her say: I did </span>it, i.e., I gave or sold the field to my husband, only to <span class="gemarra-regular">please my husband, </span>but I did not mean it.
The Gemara quotes a source for this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 55b): If one first <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">from the husban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and purchased </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the wife, </span>i.e., he purchased her rights to this land for after the death of her husband or in the event of their divorce, as stipulated in her marriage contract, then <span class="gemarra-regular">his transaction is void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Apparently, she said: I did </span>it, i.e., signed this bill of sale, only to <span class="gemarra-regular">please my husband, </span>but I did not mean it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too let her say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I did </span>it only to <span class="gemarra-regular">please my husband </span>but did not mean to give or sell the field to him.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated with regard to that </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a woman can claim that she acted only in order to please her husband is not stated with regard to all of her property, but <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only with regard to those three </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">fields </span>that have special status: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>field about <span class="gemarra-regular">which he wrote to her in her marriage contract </span>that it would serve as payment of her marriage contract; 

Daf 50a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one that he specified to her </span>as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even though it was not stipulated explicitly in the contract; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she brought into </span>the marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">an appraisal </span>of a field <span class="gemarra-regular">from her own </span>property that she owned prior to the marriage, which took on the status of guaranteed property, meaning that she will receive it if her husband dies or divorces her. If a field of one of these three types is sold with her approval, she can claim that she did not truly consent to this sale, but stated her consent only in order to please her husband.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">To exclude what </span>type of property did Rabba specify these three types of fields? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rest of </span>the husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> secured to pay her marriage contract, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will bear </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">enmity </span>if she does not agree to the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he will say to her: </span>You <span class="gemarra-regular">have placed your eyes on divorce or on </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>i.e., you will not allow me to sell my property because you are expecting and planning for my death or our divorce. Therefore, she should be able to claim that she consented to the sale only in order to please her husband with regard to other property as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>these three types of fields were specified in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude usufruct property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., property that belongs to the wife and remains in her possession while the husband has the right to enjoy the profits, in which case if the wife consents to the sale, it is valid. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t Ameimar say </span>that if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman, </span>i.e., a husband or a wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">who sold </span>the wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct property, they did not accomplish anything, </span>as the sale does not take effect?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Ameimar was stated, </span>it was to say that neither the husband nor the wife can sell the property unilaterally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where he sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, she can come and remove </span>it from the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">she sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, he can come and remove it, due to a rabbinic ordinance, and in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: </span>When the Sanhedrin convened <span class="gemarra-regular">in Usha, they instituted </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who sold </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in her husband’s lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, the husband repossesses </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the buyers.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But where the two of them sold i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to someone, or if she sold it to </span>her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sale is valid. </span>The inference that the Gemara drew from the mishna, that if the husband produces evidence that his wife sold usufruct property to him then he is regarded as the owner, is relevant when she sells her usufruct property to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who holds that one can sell property only if he possesses the item itself and also has the right to enjoy its profits.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and contracted with him </span>that the sale is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">will serve </span>the seller for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days </span>before he is transferred to the buyer, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the first master enjoys the use of the slave and the buyer is the owner of the slave himself. As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is subject to court-imposed capital punishment. But if a master strikes his Canaanite slave, and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two days and then dies, the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states four opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that during those thirty days, only <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>master <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days” </span>(Exodus 21:21). Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first master is included in this exemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is under his </span>authority, as he enjoys the use of the slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the second </span>master <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days,” because</span> the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not under his </span>authority.
Rabbi Meir’s reasoning is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> item itself. </span>The status of the first master as the owner negates the possibility that the second master would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and he would not be included in the exemption.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>master <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days,” because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is “his money” </span>(Exodus 21:21), i.e., his property; but <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>master is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days,” because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not “his money.” </span>Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like ownership of the item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself. </span>Therefore, the first master, who currently enjoys the use of the slave, does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that

Daf 50b

<span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days.” This </span>first master is included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is under his </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> second master is included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is “his money.” </span>The Gemara explains Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he is uncertain if ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the item itself, </span>in which case only the first master would be exempt, or <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like ownership of the item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself, </span>in which case only the second master would be exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital </span>law, the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient. </span>Therefore, neither of them would receive court-imposed capital punishment in this case.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“a day or two days,” </span>and both would receive court-imposed capital punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>second master is not included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not under his </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>first master is not included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not “his money.” </span>Rabbi Eliezer holds that one must both own the slave himself and enjoy the use of the slave to be included in the exemption.
The Gemara explains how Ameimar’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar? </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states:</span> “Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two days, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall not be punished; for he is his money” </span>(Exodus 21:21), and he understands this to be referring to a slave that is <span class="gemarra-regular">“his money,” </span>a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">that is unique to him, </span>so this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave. Rabbi Elazar holds that one is considered to own an item only if he owns the item itself and also enjoys the use of it. This is the source of Ameimar’s statement that neither the husband nor the wife can sell usufruct property: The husband cannot sell it because he does not own it, and the wife cannot sell it because only the husband has the right to enjoy the profits.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a man does not have </span>the ability to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his wife’s property. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman must protest? </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to whom </span>must she protest? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say: With regard to another, </span>i.e., one who is not her husband who has taken possession of her property, that is problematic: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot establish </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the property of a married woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as she can claim that she did not lodge a protest because she expected her husband to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s intention must be that she must lodge a protest <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the husband. </span>This indicates that absent her protest, it is possible for a husband to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to her property, in contrast to the ruling of the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>Rav is referring to her lodging a protest <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the husband, and </span>is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">dug pits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ditches, and caves in </span>her property. In other words, he did not simply work and profit from the land, but damaged it in a way that demonstrates that he considered himself the owner. If he does this for three years and she does not lodge a protest, he establishes the presumption of ownership. The mishna, which states that he cannot establish the presumption of ownership, is referring to standard use.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: There is no presumptive ownership with regard to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This is understood to mean that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership of another’s field by damaging it, as it is not considered to be standard use. Therefore, even after three years have passed the owner can remove one from his field. Since in this case the husband is damaging the field, he should not be able to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of presumptive ownership does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage, </span>meaning that one who damages another’s property without the owner lodging a protest does not need three years to establish the presumption of ownership, but does so immediately, as an owner who sees another damage his land is expected to protest without delay. Consequently, a husband who digs pits and the like in his wife’s property without her lodging a protest establishes the presumption of ownership immediately.
The Gemara offers an alternative answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was it not stated with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that there is no presumptive ownership with regard to damage that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari says: </span>Damage is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to smoke, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says </span>that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a bathroom? </span>The statement that there is no presumptive ownership [<span class="it-text">ḥazaka</span>] with regard to damage was not stated concerning establishing the presumption of ownership of property, but concerning acquiring the privilege [<span class="it-text">ḥazaka</span>] to engage in certain activities on one’s own property, and is stating that even if one has engaged in activities that produce smoke or foul odors, the fact that the neighbors did not lodge a protest in the past does not prevent them from doing so in the future.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Actually, </span>Rav is referring to her lodging a protest <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to another, and </span>is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who has possession of her property worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the field for <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of the time necessary to establish the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> during the husband’s lifetime, and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>additional years <span class="gemarra-regular">after the husband’s death. </span>In this case, if the woman does not lodge a protest, the possessor establishes the presumption of ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if he wanted </span>to, he could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you </span>and then possessed the field for three years, and he would be awarded the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he said to her as well: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You sold </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>your husband <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sold it to me, he is deemed credible.</span>
The Gemara returns to discuss Rav’s statement: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, Rav says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot establish </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership<span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the property of a married woman, </span>

Daf 51a

<span class="gemarra-regular">but the judges of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">exil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can establish </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">exile. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: </span>Has the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master retracted his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of a married woman? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I said </span>that the opinion of the judges of the exile <span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable, </span>as the presumption of ownership can be established with regard the property of a married woman under certain circumstances. The Gemara comments: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef </span>with regard to one who possesses the land for three years after the death of the husband.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a wife does not have </span>the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to her husband’s property. </span>The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? Since she has </span>the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance </span>from her husband’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is enjoying </span>the profits as payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance, </span>so her use of the property does not establish the presumption of ownership. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the event <span class="gemarra-regular">that he designated another </span>parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her sustenance. </span>The mishna teaches that even if she enjoys the profits of a second field for three years, she does not establish the presumption of ownership of that field.
The Gemara asks: By inference, the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the ability to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>of her ownership and take possession of her husband’s field. Why is this proof valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">say that he desires to expose </span>her concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">money. </span>If he offers to sell the field to her and she agrees, it will be discovered that she has money of which he had been unaware. His intention was never to sell the property, but to claim money to which he is entitled.
Can one <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>mishna that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he desires to expose </span>her concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">money? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>as one may <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the inference from the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> if she <span class="gemarra-regular">has proof </span>then she has ownership rights is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a deed of gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as, if her husband gave her the field as a gift, he cannot claim that he did so in order to expose her concealed money.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Master was not with us in the evening </span>in the study hall that is <span class="gemarra-regular">within the boundaries </span>of the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">where we said a superior matter. </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What superior matter did you say? </span>Rav Naḥman responded: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he desires to expose </span>her concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">money.</span>
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; remove </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money from her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she will acquire </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the bill </span>of sale, as, even if she has not yet given him the money, she acquires the land by means of the bill of sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that serves as a guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired by </span>means of giving <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>means of giving <span class="gemarra-regular">a document, or by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of it?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But wasn’t it stated with regard to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: They taught </span>that the document alone suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if the transaction is <span class="gemarra-regular">with a deed of gift, but </span>if the transaction is <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bill of sale, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">until he gives him its money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rav Huna responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Hamnuna raise an objection </span>to this, based on this following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of giving <span class="gemarra-regular">a document </span>performed? If he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him on paper or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the paper or the earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">is not worth </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if he writes: <span class="gemarra-regular">My field is sold to you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My field is acquired by you </span>as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is thereby sold or given. </span>This indicates that a document suffices to complete an acquisition both in the case of a sale and a gift.
Rav Naḥman responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>Rav Hamnuna, <span class="gemarra-regular">raises the objection and he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">resolves it? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states its ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sells his field due to its poor </span>quality. The seller wants to be rid of his field due to its low value, and would like to transfer ownership of it as quickly as possible. In this case, writing a document suffices to complete the acquisition. By contrast, in standard cases it does not. Since the acquisition of a field requires monetary payment in addition to a bill of sale, Rav Naḥman’s statement, that if one sells a field to his wife the sale is valid and we do not say that he desires to expose her concealed money, is a novelty.
The Gemara notes that in interpreting this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude in the name of Rav Naḥman, or, </span>according to another version, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: </span>Why does a document suffice for him to acquire the land? It is because it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he wanted to give it to him as a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And why did he write </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>employing the <span class="gemarra-regular">terminology of a sale? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to enhance </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>of the one acquiring the land, since with regard to a property guarantee, i.e., a document that states that if the property is seized by the seller’s creditor, the seller will reimburse the buyer for his loss, a bill of sale is superior to a deed of gift.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the ruling of Rav Naḥman, that we do not say that he desires to expose her concealed money, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">slave and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">frees him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if one borrowed money <span class="gemarra-regular">from his wife and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divorces her, they do not have any </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">on him, </span>and he need not repay them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he desires to expose </span>their concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>and his taking of the loan was a mere artifice to claim money to which he was entitled?
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncomfortable for him to make </span>applicable to <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the borrower is servant to the lender” </span>(Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Avin sent </span>a ruling to those in the study hall: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired </span>it, 

Daf 51b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as long as they remain married, the <span class="gemarra-regular">husband enjoys the profits, </span>as he would with any usufruct property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Abbahu and all of the great </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the generation said </span>that the assumption is that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to give it to her as a gift. And why did he write </span>the deed <span class="gemarra-regular">for her </span>employing terminology indicating that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of a sale? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to enhance </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">power</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to the ruling that the wife acquires the property: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed from </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">slave and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">freed him, </span>or if one borrowed <span class="gemarra-regular">from his wife and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divorced her, they do not have any </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">on him, </span>and he need not repay them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he desired to expose </span>their concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>and his taking of the loan was merely an artifice to claim money to which he was entitled? Similarly, the assumption should be that his sale to her was merely an artifice.
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncomfortable for a person to be </span>described by the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the borrower is servant to the lender” </span>(Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid.
The Gemara quotes a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband enjoys the profits. </span>In the case of one who gives a married woman the field <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, she has acquired i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the husband does not enjoy the profits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he gave it to her completely. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">she has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband does not enjoy the profits.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda performed an action </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, </span>and did not allow a husband to enjoy the profits of a field he sold to his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Ukva and Rabban Neḥemya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sons of Rav’s daughters, said to Rav Ḥisda: </span>Does the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master abandon a greater </span>Sage, i.e., Rav, the greatest Sage of his generation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and act in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lesser </span>Sage, i.e., Rabbi Elazar, who was Rav’s student? Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: But I too am acting in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a greater </span>Sage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>said: In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">she has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband does not enjoy the profits. </span>I am consequently not relying exclusively on Rabbi Elazar’s opinion, but also on that of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field to his wife, she has not acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband enjoys the profits. </span>In the case of one who gives a married woman the field <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, she has acquired it and the husband does not enjoy the profits. </span>The Gemara asks with regard to the first <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: Can these <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>ostensibly contradictory rulings be given? Rava’s statement that the wife has not acquired the field means that the husband still owns it, while his statement that the husband enjoys the profits, i.e., he merely enjoys the profits but does not own the field, indicates that the field itself is owned by the wife.
The Gemara responds: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>because Rava is referring to two different cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>where he says that she has not acquired the land, he is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the sale was an artifice to expose it; while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where he says that she acquires the land, he is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>she had <span class="gemarra-regular">money that is not concealed. As Rav Yehuda says: </span>If she purchased the field with <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed money, she has not acquired </span>it; if she purchased it with <span class="gemarra-regular">money that is not concealed,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she has acquired </span>it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not accept deposit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from women, and not from slaves, and not from children. </span>Since it is likely that they do not own property, they might have taken the item without authorization from their husband, master, or parent, respectively. Consequently, one should not accept the deposit. If, however, one <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a woman, he must return it to the woman, </span>as he cannot be certain that it is not hers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">died, he must return it to her husband, </span>as he is her heir. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a slave, he must return it to the slave, </span>since it might not belong to the master. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">died, he must return it to his master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 52a

If one <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a minor, </span>he cannot return it to him, as a minor is unable to properly safeguard the item. Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must make a safe investment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">segulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him, and if </span>the minor <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">must return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to his heirs.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said at the time of their death </span>that the deposited item <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to so-and-so, </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">should act as they </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">explained, and if </span>their explanation was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>credible, the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">form an explanatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of their explanation, </span>i.e., ignore what they said.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the wife of Rabba bar bar Ḥana was dying she said: These rings </span>that are in my possession <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to Marta and the sons of her daughter. </span>Rabba bar bar Ḥana <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav </span>to ask what he should do. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If she is credible in your </span>eyes, <span class="gemarra-regular">act as she </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation, </span>i.e., ignore what she said, and as her heir, keep them for yourself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If you assess </span>that it is likely that the rings were deposited with her, <span class="gemarra-regular">act as she </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that if the bailee took a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a minor, he must make a safe investment for him. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says: </span>The bailee should purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scroll </span>for the minor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna says: </span>He should purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">a date palm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from which </span>the minor <span class="gemarra-regular">will consume dates.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a father does not have </span>the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a son’s property, and a son does not have </span>the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a father’s property. Rav Yosef says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they separated </span>and the son is no longer dependent on his father, the presumption of ownership still cannot be established by a father or son with regard to the other’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they separated, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and the presumption of ownership can be established.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya of Difti said: Rav Pappi performed an action </span>and ruled that if <span class="gemarra-regular">they separated, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya, from </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hurmiz Ardeshid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> told me that Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov told him in the name of Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they separated, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they separated, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and the presumption of ownership can be established. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A son who separated </span>himself from his father’s finances <span class="gemarra-regular">and a wife who became divorced are like all other people </span>with regard to establishing the presumption of ownership.
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>There was a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the brothers </span>in a family <span class="gemarra-regular">who was engaging in commerce in the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>managing the family finances after the death of their father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were bills of sale [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">onot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">documents circulating with his name </span>appearing as the owner of the property and as a lender, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that brother <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The money and property <span class="gemarra-regular">are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>who is not the mother of the other brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him to bring proof </span>of ownership; otherwise the property is divided equally among the brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the brothers to bring proof </span>that the money or property belonged to their common father and consequently now belongs to all of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Abba, </span>i.e., Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to me that if </span>that brother <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the brothers to bring proof </span>in order to collect money from the deceased brother’s heirs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to </span>Shmuel’s addendum: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we claim on behalf of orphans anything that their father </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">not claim for them? But didn’t Rava remove a pair </span>of scissors used <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>cutting <span class="gemarra-regular">garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a book of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from orphans without </span>requiring the prior owner who had asked the orphans to return these items to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">proof</span> of ownership, and he would rule the same <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of all <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is common </span>for them <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lent, </span>and the one in possession has no presumption of ownership? 

Daf 52b

<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Huna bar Avin sent </span>a ruling: If one other than the one previously established to be the owner is in possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">items that are typically len</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or rented, and says: They are purchased, </span>and that is why they are <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, he is not deemed credible. </span>In this case as well, as the father of the orphans could not be awarded these documents without bringing proof, the same should be true of his orphans. Why, then, would Rav concede to Shmuel? The Gemara concedes: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: They, </span>i.e., Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>his ruling, that the brother must bring proof that he owns the property listed in the documents that appear under his name, <span class="gemarra-regular">only when they do not divide </span>any of their property, even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to their dough</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they share everything, even their food. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide with regard to their dough, say </span>that this brother <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from his dough, </span>i.e., reduced his expenses for food, thereby amassing his own property.
With regard to the requirement that proof be brought, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>is one considered to have brought <span class="gemarra-regular">proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba says: Proof </span>is brought <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span> that he purchased the property listed in the document or granted the loan with his own money or that he inherited it from his mother’s family. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: Proof </span>is brought <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the court’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the documen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in which his name appears.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: This </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel; this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet. In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master hold? </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I know a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is the source of my opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:2): In a case where there was <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the brothers who was engaging in commerce in the house, </span>managing the family finances, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were bills of sale and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">documents circulating with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his name </span>appearing as the owner of the property or as a lender, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that brother <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The money and property <span class="gemarra-regular">are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>who is not the mother of the other brothers, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him to bring proof </span>of ownership.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>i.e., a widow, if her husband’s heirs see <span class="gemarra-regular">that she is engaging in commerc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the house </span>with the property that had belonged to her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were bills of sale and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">documents circulating with her name </span>appearing on them as the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she said: </span>The money and property <span class="gemarra-regular">are mine </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father or from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">house of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>and did not belong to my husband, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon her to bring proof. </span>Rav Naḥman consequently holds in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
Having quoted the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara seeks to clarify it, and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the purpose of the clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> appears to be identical to that of the first clause? <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">woman, since the matter is laudable for her, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say: She is toiling on behalf of orphans; she </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not steal from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans, </span>and is therefore deemed credible if she says that the property in the documents that bear her name is her own, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this assumption cannot be relied upon, and she must bring proof of ownership.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that one establishes the presumption of ownership after profiting from the property for a certain duration, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of the property, which does in some cases serve as proof of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">gives a gift, or brothers who divided </span>their inheritance, or one who takes possession of the property of a convert who died without heirs and his property is now ownerless, as soon as one locked the door of the property, or fenced it or breached its fence even a bit, this is considered taking possession of the property, and effects acquisition. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these whom we </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>possessed the field for three years <span class="gemarra-regular">are not subject to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of property in this manner?
The Gemara responds that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to possession that is accompanied by a claim, </span>i.e., when the possessor has a claim to counter that of the claimant, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller, </span>i.e., the claimant, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I did not sell, and the buyer, </span>i.e., the possessor, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I purchased. </span>In that case, working and profiting from the land for three years establishes the presumption of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">possession that </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need to be <span class="gemarra-regular">accompanied by a claim, </span>as the prior owner concedes that the one in possession is the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>a case where another person <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, or </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divided </span>their property, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a convert </span>who died without heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the function of possessing the item is <span class="gemarra-regular">only to acquire </span>it and not to establish the presumption of ownership, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">locke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the door of the property, or <span class="gemarra-regular">fenced </span>it or <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>its fence even <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya teaches in </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Kiddushin</span> that was taught in the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Levi: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">locked </span>the door of the property, or <span class="gemarra-regular">fenced </span>it or <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>its fence even <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, </span>if this was done <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">presence </span>of the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of the property. The Gemara asks: One could infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presence, yes, </span>he acquires it; but <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence, no, </span>he does not acquire it. Why not? In any event he has taken possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what Rav Hoshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the act was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not say to him: Go, take possession, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the property. Since the buyer is performing the act in the seller’s presence, there is no need for the seller to specify that he consents to the buyer’s acquiring it. 

Daf 53a

But if the act was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must say to him: Go, take possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the property for him to acquire it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav raises a dilemma: How </span>does one acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, </span>i.e., is it necessary for the giver to say: Go, take possession and thereby acquire? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: What dilemma is raised to Abba, </span>i.e., Rav? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>one could say the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">is giving money </span>to the seller? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go, take possession and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the property, the acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>take effect, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say this, it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not. </span>Therefore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, </span>where no money is given to the seller, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>reasonable that the acquisition not take effect without a clear directive from the seller? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav holds </span>that it is possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives a gift gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">generously, </span>and would allow the acquisition even absent a clear directive.
§ The mishna teaches that taking possession can be performed by building a fence or breaching a fence even a bit. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: </span>If one had previously <span class="gemarra-regular">built a fence, and </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">completed i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, which is the height of a halakhically significant barrier; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>similarly, if one had previously <span class="gemarra-regular">breached a breach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and now expanded it <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>that it be large enough <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a person can <span class="gemarra-regular">enter and exit through it, this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this fence? If we say that initially </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">not climb over it </span>to enter the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now too </span>one still could <span class="gemarra-regular">not climb over it, what did he accomplish? </span>Nothing has changed through his completing the height of the fence. <span class="gemarra-regular">And alternatively, </span>if it was such <span class="gemarra-regular">that initially </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could climb over it </span>to enter the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now</span> one could <span class="gemarra-regular">not climb over it, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">accomplished a great deal, </span>and the mishna should not have referred to this addition as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to </span>state this ruling if the height of the fence was such <span class="gemarra-regular">that initially </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could climb over it with ease, and now </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could climb over it </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with effort.</span>
The Gemara similarly asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this breach? If we say that initially, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it, and now too </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it, what did </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">accomplish? </span>Nothing has changed through his expanding the breach? <span class="gemarra-regular">And alternatively, </span>if it was such <span class="gemarra-regular">that initially </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could not enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it, and now </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">accomplished a great deal, </span>and the mishna should not have referred to this as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this ruling if the size of the breach was such <span class="gemarra-regular">that initially </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it with effort, and now </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">through it with ease.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">helps </span>to serve some objective, or if one <span class="gemarra-regular">removed a stone and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">helps </span>to serve some objective, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">placed, and what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">removed?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a stone </span>in the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">and stopped the water from </span>flooding the field, or he <span class="gemarra-regular">removed a stone </span>from the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby fashioned an opening that <span class="gemarra-regular">released water </span>that had been flooding the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is analogous to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">chases away a lion from another’s property. </span>In other words, these acts prevent damage to the field, which one is obligated to prevent even in the case of the property of another, and accordingly, they do not constitute a demonstration of ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it means that he <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a stone that connected water to </span>the field and irrigated it, or he <span class="gemarra-regular">removed a stone and enhanced </span>the flow of <span class="gemarra-regular">water to it.</span>
§ The Gemara cites another statement of the same <span class="it-text">amora</span> with regard to taking possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with one boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between them, </span>and one <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of one of </span>the fields in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it. </span>

Daf 53b

If his intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it and </span>also acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> field, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the first field, but has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired the other </span>field, since the fields are separated by a boundary. If he took possession of one field in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired even that </span>field of which he took possession, since his intention when taking possession was to acquire the other field, and one does not acquire an item without the intention to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if one <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the fields in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it, and the boundary, and the other </span>field, all together? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary of the land is one, </span>i.e., these two fields are joined by means of their common boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>all of them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps this </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone and that </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone. </span>The Gemara notes that the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if one <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the boundary </span>between the two fields in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire both of </span>the fields? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">this boundary</span> is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the halter of the land and he acquires</span> the fields, just as one acquires an animal through the acquisition of its halter? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>this field <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone and that </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">stands alone, </span>as the boundary is not connected to the field in the same manner that a halter is connected to an animal. The Gemara notes that the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses </span>in a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one situated <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the courtyard relative <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>one, and one <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the outer </span>house in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it, he has acquired it. </span>If his intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it and </span>also acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>house, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired the outer </span>house, but has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired the inner </span>house. If he took possession of the outer house in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the inner </span>house alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired even the outer </span>house.
If he <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the inner </span>house in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired it. </span>If his intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire it and </span>also acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer house, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired both of them. </span>Since the residents of the inner house possess the right to pass through the outer house in order to enter and exit the courtyard, the outer house is viewed as an extension of the inner house. If he took possession of the inner house in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>house, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired even the inner </span>house, since he did not take possession of the property that he intended to acquire.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of taking possession of ownerless property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who builds large palaces </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">palterin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the property of a convert </span>who died without heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and placed doors </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>the property. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The first, </span>i.e., the one who built the palaces, <span class="gemarra-regular">merely turned over bricks, </span>i.e., building an incomplete house is not sufficient to take possession of the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi bar Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: One who finds palace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> built <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of a convert </span>who died without heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">and plastered them </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>application of <span class="gemarra-regular">plaster or </span>tiled them with <span class="gemarra-regular">one tile, has acquired them. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much, </span>i.e., what is the minimum area that must be plastered or tiled? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>A square <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit. Rav Ḥisda said: And </span>he acquires it in this manner only if it was plastered or tiled <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the entrance, </span>where it can be easily seen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram said: Rav Sheshet said this statement to us, and he enlightened our eyes from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">barait</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> that alludes to the same matter. He said: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who spreads </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">mattresse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the property of a conver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> who died without heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that which I said, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he enlightened our eyes from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is it? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 1:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>does one acquire a Canaanite slave <span class="gemarra-regular">through taking possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">shoe for him, or untied </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">shoe for him, or </span>if it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">that he carried his garments after him to the bathhouse, or undresses him, or bathes him, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">anoints him, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">scrubs </span>the oil off <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or dresses him, or puts on his shoes, or lifts him, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the slave. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: </span>The acquisition generated by taking <span class="gemarra-regular">possession should not be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than </span>the acquisition generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting, as lifting acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">in any situation.</span>
With regard to this last statement, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>here, as the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> also said that a slave can be acquired by lifting? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he lifted his master, </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires him, </span>as he is performing labor for the master, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">his master lifted him, </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire him, </span>as the slave has not performed labor on his behalf. With regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: </span>Acquisition generated through taking <span class="gemarra-regular">possession should not be greater than </span>acquisition generated through <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting, as lifting acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">in any situation. </span>Consequently, one can acquire a slave even by lifting him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya Bira’a says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one</span>

Daf 54a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who threw turni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">in the crevices [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">filei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the land of a convert </span>who died without heirs, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sufficient to <span class="gemarra-regular">take possession. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As at the time that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>the seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">there was no enhancement </span>to the value of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that </span>the turnips have grown and the value of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is enhanced, it is enhanced by itself.</span>
The Gemara records a series of rulings with regard to taking possession of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who cuts </span>the branches of <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">of the palm tree, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it; but if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">of the animals, </span>to feed his animals the branches, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired </span>it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>branches <span class="gemarra-regular">from this side and from that side, </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">of the palm tree, </span>as this assists the growth of the tree; but if the branches that he took were <span class="gemarra-regular">all from one side, </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">of the animals.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who clears [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dezakkei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">zikheya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> a field of trees, if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field, </span>to prepare it for plowing, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>it; but if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the collection <span class="gemarra-regular">of the wood, he has not acquired </span>it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">took large and small </span>pieces of wood, he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field; </span>however, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>pieces of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">but left </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>ones, he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the collection <span class="gemarra-regular">of the wood.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who removes protuberance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and levels the ground, if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field, </span>to prepare it for plowing, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it; but if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the conversion <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> the field into <span class="gemarra-regular">a threshing floor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has not acquired </span>it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">took a mound and threw it in a ditch, </span>thereby leveling both areas, he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field; </span>but if he leveled the ground with <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound in </span>the place of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound and a ditch in </span>the place of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch, </span>expanding each area but leaving the field as a whole uneven, he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the conversion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the field into <span class="gemarra-regular">a threshing floor.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who opened </span>a blockage and enabled <span class="gemarra-regular">wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to enter <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>a section of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field, </span>to irrigate it, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it; but if he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the catching <span class="gemarra-regular">of the fish, </span>i.e., to enable the water to flow in so that he could catch the fish therein, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired </span>it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">opened two gates, one bringing in </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">and one taking out </span>the water, this indicates that he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the catching <span class="gemarra-regular">of the fish, </span>as the water will flow out of the field, giving him the means to catch the fish; but if he opened only <span class="gemarra-regular">one gate, </span>this indicates that he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>the improvement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who profited </span>from an ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">palm tree by cuttin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> its branches for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen years. Another </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed beneath it a bit. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Levi, and some say </span>that it came <span class="gemarra-regular">before Mar Ukva, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of the one who plowed. The woman <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">shouted before him, </span>protesting the perceived injustice of his ruling. Mar Ukva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: What can I do for you, as you did not take possession </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that people take possession?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One who draws an imag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e,</span> e.g., he paints an image on the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of a convert </span>who died without heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the garden of the house </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>which had been ownerless property, <span class="gemarra-regular">only by </span>drawing <span class="gemarra-regular">an image.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">defined by its boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it has clearly demarcated boundaries on all sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Once he struck </span>the land with a hoe <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time, he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the entire </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired only the place </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he struc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> with the hoe. 

Daf 54b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is not define</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by its boundaries, up to how much </span>of the field is acquired by one strike of the hoe? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>He acquires as far <span class="gemarra-regular">as an ox driver goe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and returns, </span>i.e., the size of a standard furrow, beginning where the hoe entered the ground.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a gentile </span>that was sold to a Jew for money, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">like a deser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> until the purchaser performs an act of acquisition; <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who takes possession of it </span>in the interim has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason </span>for this? The <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile relinquishes </span>ownership of it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the moment <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money reaches his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>who purchased it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">until the deed reache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his hand. Therefore, </span>in the period of time between the giving of the money and the receiving of the deed, the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is like a desert, and anyone who takes possession of it </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Shmuel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law of the kingdom is the law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> obligates Jews to observe the laws of the locale in which they reside, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the king said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">land may not be acquired without a document? </span>Therefore, taking possession should not be effective for acquisition. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I do not know </span>how to reconcile this contradiction, but <span class="gemarra-regular">there was an incident in </span>the village of <span class="gemarra-regular">Dura that </span>was founded by <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew who purchased land from a gentile </span>by giving money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the interim <span class="gemarra-regular">another Jew came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed it a bit. </span>The two Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yehuda </span>for a ruling, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the second </span>individual. This accords with the ruling of Shmuel that the property is ownerless until a Jew performs an act of acquisition.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Are you saying </span>that the incident occurred in <span class="gemarra-regular">Dura that </span>was founded by <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherds? </span>Proof cannot be brought from that case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fields were concealed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since </span>the owners of fields <span class="gemarra-regular">would not pay the land tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taska</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the king, and the king says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who pays land tax </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">profit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the field. </span>Therefore, in that case, the gentile who sold the property did not actually own it, and consequently by the laws of the kingdom could not sell it. The one who took possession of the property acquired it in accordance with the law of the kingdom, as he committed to pay the land tax. Elsewhere, one would not acquire the field until he received a deed of sale from the gentile.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna purchased land from a gentile. Another Jew came and plowed it slightly. </span>Rav Huna and that Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession </span>of the latter. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are you thinking </span>in issuing this ruling? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because Shmuel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of a gentile is like a desert, and anyone who takes possession of it </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it? </span>

Daf 55a

If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master should do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me in accordance with another </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel says </span>that one who hoes ownerless property <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired only the place that he struck </span>with the hoe. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: In this </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">I hold in accordance with our </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Once he struck </span>the land with a hoe <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time, he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the entire </span>property.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Avin sent </span>a ruling: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew who purchased a field from a gentile, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">another Jew came and took possession of it, it is not removed from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of </span>the second Jew. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Ile’a, and all of our Rabbis agree with regard to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: These three statements were told to me </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">Ukvan bar Neḥemya the Exilarc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Shmuel: The law of the kingdom is the law; and </span>the term of <span class="gemarra-regular">Persian sharecropping [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arisuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> is for <span class="gemarra-regular">up to forty years, </span>since according to Persian laws the presumption of ownership is established after forty years of use; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">these tax officials [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zaharurei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who sold land </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">land tax, the sale is valid, </span>as the tax officials were justified in seizing it, and one may purchase the land from them.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies to land seized <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">land tax, but not </span>to land seized <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">head tax. What is the reason </span>for this? The <span class="gemarra-regular">head tax is placed on a man’s head, </span>i.e., the obligation of this tax is on the individual and is unrelated to his property. It is therefore theft for the tax officials to sell land for this purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>Everything, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">barley in the pitcher, is mortgaged for </span>the payment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">head tax.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar raised a difficulty with regard to this </span>statement of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, you have abolished the inheritance of the firstborn so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of one who owes taxes to the kingdom. If everything can be seized by the tax collectors to pay the father’s debt, any property that he left behind <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a potential </span>inheritance, not actually property of the heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn does not take </span>a double share <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> potential </span>inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>property that the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed.</span>
The Gemara continues the statement of Huna bar Natan: And <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to </span>Ameimar: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that this presents a difficulty, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the property can be seized as payment for the <span class="gemarra-regular">land tax </span>this difficulty would present itself <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>as the sons would not inherit their father’s estate in the event that it is seized to pay the land tax. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say </span>to deflect this question? That the firstborn son’s right is not negated in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the father <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land tax and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>so that he is no longer indebted to the government and the field is completely his. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the firstborn son maintains his rights in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">head tax and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me: I asked </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">scribes </span>who wrote documents and recorded halakhic rulings in the court <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, and they said to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>who states that one’s possessions are all mortgaged for the payment of the head tax. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>Huna bar Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to buttress his </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ashi said: An idler </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ardakht</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> must <span class="gemarra-regular">assist the tow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> by paying taxes even though he has no income in that town. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the town saved him </span>from his obligation by asking for a reduction on his behalf. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">tax collectors [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">andisekei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> do not seek to collect his debt this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">heavenly assistance, </span>and he is not obligated to volunteer to pay his share.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The boundary </span>between fields <span class="gemarra-regular">and the sea squil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that was planted to demarcate the border between fields <span class="gemarra-regular">serve as a barrier </span>between fields <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the property of a convert </span>who died without heirs, so that one who takes possession of the property acquires land only until the boundary or the sea squill, but not other land the convert had possessed beyond that point. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>serve as a barrier between fields <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the matter of produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and even the area beyond it is considered to be part of the same field. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, he <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>They serve as a barrier between the fields <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ritual impurity.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span> that is affected by determining whether it is one or two fields? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 2:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">And these serve as a barrier for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the presence of any of these divides a field so that each section constitutes a distinct field from which <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> must be given independently: <span class="gemarra-regular">A strea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that passes through the field; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a canal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> 

Daf 55b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and a public roa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that is at least sixteen cubits wide; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a private road </span>that is four cubits wide; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a public trail; and a permanent private trai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that is used <span class="gemarra-regular">whether in the summer or in the rainy season, </span>i.e., winter. Rav Asi and Ravin disagree with regard to whether Rabbi Yoḥanan held that a boundary or sea squill also serves to subdivide a field for the purpose of <span class="it-text">pe’a</span>.
The Gemara further clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that is affected by determining whether an area is one or two fields? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Teharot</span> 6:5): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who enters into a valley during the rainy season</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, and therefore for the purpose of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> it is considered a private domain, and there is a principle that in a case of uncertainty concerning whether one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity in such and such a field, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I know <span class="gemarra-regular">I walked to that place, </span>i.e., I walked in the valley, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I do not know whether I entered that place </span>where the ritual impurity was <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether I did not </span>enter, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer deems him pur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the Rabbis deem him impure.</span>
Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Eliezer would say: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">entry, </span>i.e., it is uncertain whether he entered the area where the ritual impurity is located, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure. </span>But if he certainly entered the area where the ritual impurity is located and the <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">contact </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure. </span>It is with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that Ravin said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that a boundary or sea squill defines these fields as distinct areas.
The Gemara infers, though, that even Ravin holds that a boundary or sea squill serves as a barrier only with regard to <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> and ritual impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>serve as a barrier between fields.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>They serve as a barrier between fields <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to the matter of Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">carried out half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dried fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> from a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain and placed it </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and carried out another half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dried fig, </span>if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">within one lapse of awareness, </span>i.e., he did not remember in the interim that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, the two acts are considered as one, and since the two items together equal the size of a dried fig, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring a sin-offering. But if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">within two lapses </span>of awareness, i.e., after he carried out the first half of a dried fig he remembered that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, but subsequently forgot again and carried out the second half of a dried fig, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>If it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">within one lapse of awareness, </span>

Daf 56a

and <span class="gemarra-regular">in one domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he carried half the dried fig into the same public domain each time, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>but if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in two domains, </span>i.e., he carried the item into two separate public domains, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>in explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>division of the public domain applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span>a property where one would incur <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering </span>if one unintentionally carried out of it or into it, i.e., a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two sections. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if there was only <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., an area that is not defined as either a private domain or public domain and to and from which the prohibition against carrying is only of rabbinic origin, it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divide the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: Even a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span> divides the public domain into separate sections, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a beam </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">isela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not. Rava says: Even a beam </span>divides the public domain, since it is no less than a boundary or sea squill, which do serve as a barrier between fields.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava follows his </span>own line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava says: </span>The definition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>for the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is like </span>the definition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>for the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">bills of divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Just as a beam is defined as a distinct domain for the purpose of bills of divorce, so too it is considered a distinct domain for the purpose of Shabbat.
The Gemara returns to discuss the acquisition of a field that belonged to a convert who died without heirs. The Gemara asks: If <span class="gemarra-regular">there was no boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">no sea squill, what </span>are the limits to the acquisition? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Marinus explains in the name </span>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">that is called by his name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where it is called by his name? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Where it is called: The place </span>that is irrigated by <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so’s well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The entire area referred to as such would be considered one section with regard to acquisition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Avya sat before Rabbi Asi, and he sat and was saying </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Asi bar Ḥanina: </span>A row of <span class="gemarra-regular">sea squill serves as a barrier with regard to the property of a convert </span>who died without heirs, so that each section is considered a distinct field.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sea squill? Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>It is the growth <span class="gemarra-regular">by which Joshua established the boundaries of Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">for the Jews.</span>
The Gemara teaches a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>In his book, <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua enumerated only the towns that stand upon the borders, </span>but not the towns that were within the portions of each tribe.
On the subject of the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Any </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed to Moses </span>before his death, as it is written: “And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead…as far as Zoar” (Deuteronomy 34:1–3), is within the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, and therefore produce that grows there is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in tithe.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To exclude what </span>area? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">To exclude </span>the lands of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite, </span>as God had promised to Abraham at the Covenant between the Pieces: “To your offspring have I given this land…to…the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite” (Genesis 15:18–19). These areas are not obligated in tithe. What are these three areas? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">Naftuḥa, Arva’a, and Shalma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">Mount Seir, Ammon, and Moab</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">Ardisekis, Asya, and Aspamya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testifying on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">behal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he, the possessor of the land, worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from a field for <span class="gemarra-regular">three years, </span>and therefore has presumptive ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses, as it was proven that they were not present to witness the matter about which they had testified, they must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the true owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>value of the field that they attempted, through their testimony, to remove from his possession, as it is written in the Torah: “Then shall you do to him, as he had planned to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses testify that he worked and profited from the field <span class="gemarra-regular">during the first </span>year, another <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>testify that he worked and profited from it <span class="gemarra-regular">during the second </span>year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>testify that he worked and profited from it <span class="gemarra-regular">during the third, </span>and all were found to be conspiring witnesses, 

Daf 56b

payment of the value of the field to the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">divided among them.</span>
If the testimony was given by <span class="gemarra-regular">three brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> each of whom testify about one year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>unrelated individual <span class="gemarra-regular">joined with </span>each of the brothers as the second witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are three </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies </span>and they are accepted by the court. If they were to be considered one testimony, it would not be accepted, as brothers may not testify together. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are one testimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the purpose of rendering them as <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses, and the payment is divided among them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, 2:10) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: When Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥalafta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Yosei’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">went to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri to study Torah, and some say: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri </span>went <span class="gemarra-regular">to Abba Ḥalafta to study Torah, he said to him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from a field <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>witnesses during the <span class="gemarra-regular">first year, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>other witnesses during the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>year, and finally <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>other witnesses during the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>year? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is </span>sufficient for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
The latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I say this as well, but Rabbi Akiva disagrees with regard to this matter, as Rabbi Akiva would say </span>that since the verse states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), one can derive that testimony is accepted only with regard to a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, and not </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter. </span>In this mishna, although presumptive ownership requires testimony that the property had been worked and profited from for three years, testimony is accepted from each pair of witnesses with regard to one year. Consequently, the ruling of the mishna does not accord with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who accept the testimony of each of the three pairs of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">what do they do with this </span>derivation of: A complete <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, and not half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter, </span>i.e., what type of testimony is disqualified based on this derivation? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude</span> a case where two witnesses testify that a young woman has two pubic hairs and has therefore reached maturity, where <span class="gemarra-regular">one says </span>she has <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on her bac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one says </span>she has <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on her </span>lower <span class="gemarra-regular">abdomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they are testifying to two different pubic hairs, and in this case the Rabbis say this testimony is not accepted, since they each testify with regard to only half of the matter, that is difficult. But <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter and half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a testimony, </span>as there is only one witness with regard to each pubic hair. This testimony would not be valid even without the derivation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>in the opinion of the Rabbis the derivation serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>she has <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on her bac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>she has <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on her </span>lower <span class="gemarra-regular">abdomen. </span>In this case, each group of witnesses gives full testimony with regard to half of a matter, i.e., one pubic hair, as both hairs must be present concurrently in order for her to assume the status of an adult. By contrast, in the case of the mishna, the years are by definition not concurrent. Therefore, the Rabbis rule that testimony with regard to one year is accepted.
§ In a related matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>If two witnesses testify that one had worked and profited from a field for three years, where <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says he consumed wheat </span>from the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one says he consumed barley </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">it, this is </span>sufficient for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman objects to this </span>ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>he worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from the field during the <span class="gemarra-regular">first, third, and fifth </span>years; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says he </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">second, fourth, and sixth </span>years, would you <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sufficient for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership? What is the difference between testifying about different crops and testifying about different years?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said to him: How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>i.e., in your example, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the year </span>about which one <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">is testifying, </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Master is not testifying </span>about it, while <span class="gemarra-regular">here, both are testifying with regard to one year. What is there to say, </span>that there is a contradiction in their testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">between wheat and barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It does not enter people’s minds </span>to note this distinction. Two witnesses did, however, testify that he worked and profited from the field for three years.
§ The mishna teaches that if the testimony was given by <span class="gemarra-regular">three brothers, </span>each of whom testified about one year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another, </span>unrelated individual <span class="gemarra-regular">joined with </span>each of the brothers as the second witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are three </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies </span>and they are accepted by the court. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are one testimony for</span> the purpose of rendering them as <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses. 

Daf 57a

The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain document that had the signature</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of two </span>individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">on it. One of </span>the signatory witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>and when the court sought to ratify the document, which requires either that the witnesses personally attest to the validity of their signatures or that two other witnesses attest to the validity of the signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">the brother of the </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">who remained </span>alive <span class="gemarra-regular">and one other </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">came to testify with regard to the signature of the other, </span>deceased, witness, while the living witness attested to his own signature.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina thought to say </span>that this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>which states that if testimony was given by <span class="gemarra-regular">three brothers, </span>each of whom testify about one year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another, </span>unrelated individual <span class="gemarra-regular">joined with </span>each of the brothers as the second witness, these are considered to be three distinct testimonies. Similarly, in this case, one brother attests to his own signature, while the other brother attests to the signature of the deceased witness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: Are </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, the property less one-quarter, </span>i.e., three-quarters of the property in question, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not removed </span>from the possession of the prior owner based <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the mouth, </span>i.e., the testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">of brothers. </span>Each brother provides only half of the testimony for each year about which he testifies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, the property less one-quarter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is removed </span>from the possession of the debtor detailed in the document based <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the mouth of brothers. </span>One brother attests to his own signature, which constitutes half of the testimony, while the other signature is authenticated by the testimony of the other brother and another individual. It follows that three-quarters of the testimony is given by brothers, and it is therefore invalid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>uses of property <span class="gemarra-regular">that have </span>the means to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and these are </span>uses of property <span class="gemarra-regular">that do not have </span>the means to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard; </span>or if one would place <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a millstone, or a stove </span>there; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">raises chickens </span>in a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">or places his fertilizer in a courtyard, </span>these actions <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.<span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">constructed a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high to </span>contain <span class="gemarra-regular">his animal, and similarly </span>if he constructed a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">oven, and similarly </span>if he constructed a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">stove, and similarly </span>if he constructed a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">millstone; </span>or if one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought chickens into the house, or </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned a place </span>in the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">for his fertilizer </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep or three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>these actions <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>sufficient to establish the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of ownership.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>where having an animal stand in a courtyard is insufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>where constructing a partition is sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">which, if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>to perform it <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>ownerless property such as the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a convert </span>who dies without heirs he would <span class="gemarra-regular">acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that property, that same act is sufficient for him to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the property of another </span>if he performed it over the course of three years, provided it is accompanied by the claim that the property had been purchased. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>to perform it <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a convert </span>who died without heirs he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>that property, that same act is sufficient for him to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the property of another. </span>Taking possession of ownerless property requires an act to be done with regard to the property itself, such as constructing a partition, but merely having an animal stand there is not sufficient. Therefore, it does not establish the presumption of ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>this an established <span class="gemarra-regular">principle? But there is plowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which, </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a convert </span>who died without heirs one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it, but if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of another </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is consumption of produce </span>for the duration of three years, <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of another </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires</span> it by establishing the presumption of ownership, but if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of a convert</span> who died without heirs one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>it. These cases contradict Ulla’s claim that the modes of acquisition are analogous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: </span>

Daf 57b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with a courtyard belonging to partners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where they are not particular with regard to the mere placing </span>of items in the courtyard, but <span class="gemarra-regular">are particular with regard to </span>the construction of <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition. </span>The presumption of ownership is established only where the lack of a protest indicates that the prior owner concedes that the property is no longer his. The co-owner’s silence in the face of his partner using the courtyard for a temporary purpose does not indicate a concession, but silence in the face of one who constructed a partition is a concession.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">not particular with regard to the mere placing </span>of items? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 45b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Partners who through vows prohibited </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">from deriving benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one another are forbidden to enter into a courtyard </span>jointly owned by them, since each one has a portion in it, and it would be considered a violation of one’s vow if one were to benefit from any part of the other’s property? This indicates that partners are particular even with regard to passage through the field; all the more so are they particular with regard to placing animals or vessels in the field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: Here we are dealing with </span>a fenced-in <span class="gemarra-regular">yard </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">behind </span>a group of <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that is used to store items not in regular use, <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are not par-ticular with regard to the mere placing </span>of items <span class="gemarra-regular">but are particular with regard to </span>the construction of <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This and that, </span>i.e., the rulings of the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> as well as the rulings of the mishna here, are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard belonging to partners, and </span>the reason for the difference in the rulings is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are those who are particular </span>with regard to the other partner placing items in or passing through the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there are those who are not particular. </span>Therefore, in the mishna here, which issues a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning monetary matters, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> be <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is assumed that the partner is not particular about placing items in the courtyard, and the presumption of ownership is established. In the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Nedarim</span>, which issues a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning ritual matters, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, </span>to prevent one from violating a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Actually, </span>partners <span class="gemarra-regular">are not particular </span>about placing items in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Nedarim</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: Even </span>negligible benefits ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit </span>from another. In other words, one prohibited by a vow may not derive any benefit from the other, even a benefit that people commonly are not particular about and allow others to enjoy without first receiving permission. Therefore, although people are ordinarily not particular about others passing through their property, according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from his partner is prohibited from walking on the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Bena’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Partners may prevent each other </span>from using their courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">for any </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>washing <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not the way of Jewish women to be degraded over </span>washing <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry </span>by laundering their clothing in a public area. Therefore, they must be allowed to launder in the courtyard.
In connection with the matter of laundry being washed in public, the Gemara quotes the homiletic interpretation of a verse: “He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</span> (Isaiah 33:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: This </span>is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not gaze at wome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">while they are standing over the laundry, </span>as it was common for them to stand in the water and raise the hems of their garments while laundering their clothing.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is another way </span>by which the one walking could reach his destination, then one who walks past the women, consequently placing himself in a situation where he will be tempted to gaze at them, <span class="gemarra-regular">is wicked. </span>Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no other way </span>by which he can reach his destination, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstance, </span>so why is he required to shut his eyes? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no other way </span>by which he can reach his destination, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even so, he is required to compel himself </span>to avoid gazing at the women.
§ The Gemara quotes additional matters that Rabbi Yoḥanan learned from Rabbi Bena’a. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Bena’a: How </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">the garment of a Torah schola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> worn under his clothes be fashioned? He replied: He can wear <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>garment long enough <span class="gemarra-regular">that his flesh is not visible from beneath it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">the cloak of a Torah scholar </span>be fashioned? He replied: He can wear <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>garment long enough <span class="gemarra-regular">that a handbreadth of his garment </span>worn under his clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">is not visible from beneath it. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">the table of a Torah schola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> appear? He replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two-thirds </span>of the table is covered with <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one-third </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncovered, and upon </span>that third are <span class="gemarra-regular">dishes and vegetables. And its ring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> used to hang the table, should be positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, </span>not on the side that faces the one who is eating.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">its ring </span>should be positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside? </span>The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a child </span>who may play with the ring and overturn the table, while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no child </span>present.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>refer to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no child </span>present, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is an attendant </span>who may bump into the ring, while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no attendant.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>refer to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is an attendant, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to when the meal is eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day, </span>when the attendant can see the ring and avoid it, while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to when the meal is eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">during the night.</span>
The Gemara continues: All of the above is referring to the table of a Torah scholar, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the table <span class="gemarra-regular">of an ignoramus is similar</span>

Daf 58a

<span class="gemarra-regular">to a bonfire, </span>where the fire is in the center <span class="gemarra-regular">and pots surround it. </span>Similarly, the table of an ignoramus is arranged with the food in the center and is surrounded by plates.
Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">the bed of Torah scholars </span>be kept? He replied: It is acceptable <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as there </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing except sandal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beneath it during the summer, and shoes </span>beneath it <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rainy season, </span>i.e., winter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the bed <span class="gemarra-regular">of an ignoramus </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a cluttered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">balus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> storehouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he keeps a wide array of items beneath it.
§ Having mentioned Rabbi Bena’a, the Gemara relates an incident in which he was involved. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Bena’a was marking </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">caves </span>for the purpose of helping to prevent the contracting of ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he arrived at the cave of Abraham, </span>i.e., the Cave of Machpelah, <span class="gemarra-regular">he encountered Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">servant </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham, who was standing before the entrance. </span>Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is Abraham doing </span>at this moment? Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">lying in the arms of Sarah, and she is examining his head.</span>
Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go tell him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Bena’a is standing at the entrance, </span>so that he should assume an appropriate position to receive a visitor. Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let </span>him, i.e., Rabbi Bena’a, <span class="gemarra-regular">enter, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known that there is no </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination in this </span>higher <span class="gemarra-regular">world, </span>so it is not inappropriate for Rabbi Bena’a to see Abraham and Sarah in this position. He <span class="gemarra-regular">entered, examined </span>the cave in order to measure it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and exited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When he arrived at the cave of Adam the first </span>man, who is buried in the same area, <span class="gemarra-regular">a Divine Voice emerged and said: You gazed upon the likeness of My image</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Abraham, who is similar to the image of Adam the first man. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not gaze upon My image itself, </span>i.e., Adam the first man, about whom the verse states that he was formed in the image of God (see Genesis 1:27). Rabbi Bena’a said: <span class="gemarra-regular">But I need to mark the cave. </span>The voice said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the measurements of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dimensions of the outer </span>cave where Abraham is buried, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>are the measurements of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dimensions of the inner </span>cave, where Adam is buried. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that the Cave of Machpelah consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">two chambers, this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">above that </span>one, not two adjacent chambers, the voice said: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the measurements of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dimensions of the upper </span>cave where Abraham is buried, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>are the measurements of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dimensions of the lower </span>cave. Therefore, there is no need to measure it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Bena’a says: I gazed at his, </span>Adam’s, <span class="gemarra-regular">two heels, and </span>they shone so brightly that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are similar to two suns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Along these lines, the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">compared to Sarah </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">like a monkey compared to a human, </span>as Sarah was exceedingly beautiful; <span class="gemarra-regular">Sarah compared to Eve </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a monkey compared to a human; Eve compared to Adam </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a monkey compared to a human; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Adam compared to the Divine Presence </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a monkey compared to a human.</span>
It was also stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">the beauty of Rav Kahana is a semblance of the beauty of Rav. The beauty of Rav is a semblance of the beauty of Rabbi Abbahu. The beauty of Rabbi Abbahu is a semblance of the beauty of Jacob our forefather. The beauty of Jacob our forefather is a semblance of the beauty of Adam the first </span>man.
On the topic of burial caves, the Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain magus [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amgusha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was rummaging </span>through the graves of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at the </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">cave of Rav Tovi bar Mattana, </span>Rav Tovi <span class="gemarra-regular">grabbed him by his beard </span>and would not release him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye came and said to </span>Rav Tovi: <span class="gemarra-regular">I beg of you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">release him. </span>The magus <span class="gemarra-regular">came again in another year, </span>and Rav Tovi <span class="gemarra-regular">grabbed him by his beard. Abaye came </span>and requested that he release him, but Rav Tovi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not release him, until </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">brought a scissors and cut his beard.</span>
§ The Gemara relates additional incidents involving Rabbi Bena’a: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>his family before he died: <span class="gemarra-regular">A barrel of earth to one of my sons, a barrel of bones to one of my sons, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrel of wads </span>of wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to one of my sons. They did not know what he was saying to them. They came before Rabbi Bena’a </span>for guidance. Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Do you have land </span>that your father left as an inheritance? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Yes. </span>He asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you have livestock </span>that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes. </span>He asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you have quilts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bistarkei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes. </span>He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is what he said to you, </span>i.e., he meant that he is bequeathing land to one son, livestock to the second, and quilts to the third.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who heard his wife saying to her daughter: Why do you not act clandestinely </span>when you engage <span class="gemarra-regular">in forbidden </span>sexual intercourse? <span class="gemarra-regular">That woman has, </span>i.e., I have, <span class="gemarra-regular">ten sons, and I have only one from your father, </span>and no one knows. So too, you must be careful so that no one will discover your illicit behavior. Having overheard that only one son was his, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>that man <span class="gemarra-regular">was dying he said to </span>his family: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of my property </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to one son.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They did not know </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">which of them </span>he intended to leave his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rabbi Bena’a </span>for guidance, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to </span>the sons: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go strike your father’s grave, until he rises and reveals to you to which of you he left </span>his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">They all went, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was his son did not go. </span>Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: All of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property belongs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>son who did not go. The other brothers were angry. <span class="gemarra-regular">They went and slandered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhlu</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kuretza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> Rabbi Bena’a in <span class="gemarra-regular">the king’s house. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They said: There is one man among the Jews who removes money from people without witnesses and without any </span>evidence. The king’s guards <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">and imprisoned him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The wife of </span>Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the guards: <span class="gemarra-regular">I had one servant. They cut off his head, and skinned him and ate his flesh, and they fill him with water and </span>give their <span class="gemarra-regular">friends to drink from him, and they have not paid me </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">value nor have they rented him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They did not know what she was saying to them. They said: Let us bring the wise </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Jews, and let him say </span>what she meant. <span class="gemarra-regular">They called Rabbi Bena’a, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: She spoke to you of a water skin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zarnuka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, she was referring to a goat she owned that was slaughtered, its meat eaten, and its skin made into a water skin that could be filled with drinking water. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: Since </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">so wise, let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">sit at the gate </span>where the judges congregate <span class="gemarra-regular">and render judgment.</span>
Rabbi Bena’a <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that it was written upon the gate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’abbula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Any judge who is summoned to judgment is not considered a judge, </span>as judges must be above reproach. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: If that is so, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person comes from elsewhere</span>

Daf 58b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and summons </span>a judge <span class="gemarra-regular">to judgment, </span>has he <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>the judge even if he were later to be exonerated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he was ordered to return someone’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered a judge. </span>When they heard this, <span class="gemarra-regular">they wrote this </span>addendum to the original inscription: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the elders of the Jews say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him is not considered a judge.</span>
Rabbi Bena’a also <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that it was written </span>there: <span class="gemarra-regular">At the head </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">all death am I, blood, </span>i.e., people die from an excess of blood; <span class="gemarra-regular">at the head </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">all life am I, wine, </span>i.e., wine is what gives life. He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>in the case of someone <span class="gemarra-regular">who falls from a roof and dies, or</span> someone <span class="gemarra-regular">who falls from a palm tree and dies, </span>was it <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">killed him? And furthermore, </span>concerning someone <span class="gemarra-regular">who is on the way to death, can they give him a drink of wine and </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">live? Rather, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">should be written: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine. </span>When they heard this, <span class="gemarra-regular">they wrote this </span>addendum to the original inscription: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the elders of the Jews say: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine. In a place where there is no wine, herbs are required there </span>as medicines.
Having related that incident, the Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">at the entrance of Kapotekiyy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">written: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Anpak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">anbag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">antal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which are all names for the same measurement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">antal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> protruding from one’s roof gutter draining water into another’s property, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">privileg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its place, </span>as the Gemara will explain. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a gutter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pip</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that traverses the length of the roof, one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an Egyptian ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is small and portable, one <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a Tyrian </span>ladder, which is large and fixed in place, one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use.

Rabbi Yehuda says: If </span>a window <span class="gemarra-regular">has a frame, even though a person’s head is not able to fit inside it, </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the mishna’s statement: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a spout, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege with regard to its place? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: This </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a spout, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the owner of the field below has the right to move the spout from one place to another on one side of the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerning its place with regard to two sides, </span>i.e., the owner of the field below does not have the right to move it to another side of the roof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said </span>there is a different explanation: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a spout, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>size, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it was long, </span>the owner of the field below may <span class="gemarra-regular">shorten it, but </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if </span>the owner of the field below <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to remove it </span>entirely, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not remove it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>there is a different explanation: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a spout, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>the owner of the field below <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to buil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beneath it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build, </span>and the owner of the spout may not prevent him from doing so; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if </span>the owner of the field below <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to remove i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> entirely, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not remove it. </span>

Daf 59a

<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a gutter pipe, </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says those </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>explanations, i.e., Shmuel and Rabbi Ḥanina, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. </span>The distinction between the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a spout and that of a gutter pipe is clear: Since the gutter pipe is fixed in place, there is an acquired privilege, and it may not be moved or shortened.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that the mishna means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to build beneath it </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build, what difference does it make to </span>the owner of the gutter pipe if the owner of the field builds beneath it? Why would he have the right to prevent it?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with a gutter pipe </span>that is made of stone and is built into the walls <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">building, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the gutter pipe <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the field: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not amenable to me </span>that you build beneath my gutter pipe, <span class="gemarra-regular">as my walls will weaken </span>as a result.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pipe </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">which water is drainin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into another’s courtyard and the owner of the roof comes to seal </span>his drainage pipe, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the courtyard can prevent him </span>from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the owner of the field can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Just as you have acquired my courtyard for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">throwing your water into it, I have also acquired the water of your roof, </span>and since I wish to use it, you may not seal the pipe.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that there is a dispute with regard to this issue, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya says: </span>The owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can prevent </span>the owner of the roof from sealing the pipe, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama, </span>Rabbi Oshaya’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He cannot prevent </span>it. Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>Rabbi Ḥama’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Bisa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Bisa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">can prevent </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama read </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>him: “And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a threefold cord is not quickly broken” </span>(Ecclesiastes 4:12), saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Bisa, </span>three generations of Torah scholars in one family who knew one another and conversed with each other with regard to matters of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
§ The mishna teaches that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an Egyptian ladder, </span>which is small and portable, one <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is an Egyptian ladder like? </span>The members <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the school of Rabbi Yannai say: It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>ladder that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have four rungs.</span>
The mishna teaches that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an Egyptian</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> window, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different with regard to </span>an Egyptian <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder, that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not explain </span>what it is, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different with regard to </span>an Egyptian <span class="gemarra-regular">window, that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does explain </span>what it is? The Gemara answers: It was necessary for the mishna to state the definition of an Egyptian window according to the unattributed opinion of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to </span>cite the <span class="gemarra-regular">dissenting </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda in the latter clause.</span>
With regard to windows, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says: </span>If one built a large window at a height that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lower than four cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the ground, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore, his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can protest </span>the initial construction of the window. If one built a large window at a height that is <span class="gemarra-regular">above four cubits </span>from the ground, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot protest </span>its construction. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ile’a says: Even </span>if it is built at a height that is <span class="gemarra-regular">above four cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the ground, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>nevertheless, his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can protest </span>its construction.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to </span>whether there is <span class="gemarra-regular">coercion concerning conduct </span>characteristic <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sodom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Perhaps their dispute is with regard to a circumstance where one will not suffer any loss while another gains some benefit, and the former desires to prevent the latter from gaining the benefit, if the former is coerced into not being evil without reason and consequently allows the latter to derive the benefit, counter to the behavior of the residents of Sodom. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Zeira, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">coercion, </span>and therefore the neighbor who does not suffer any damage from a high window cannot protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Ile’a, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no coercion.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>agrees that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">coercion </span>concerning conduct characteristic of Sodom, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different here, </span>as according to the opinion of Rabbi Ile’a this is not conduct characteristic of Sodom, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the neighbor can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the one who constructed the window: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times when you place a benc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beneath yourself, and </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">stand and see </span>into my home. Therefore, I can protest. The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before Rabbi Ami </span>and presented this precise scenario. Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him before Rabbi Abba bar Memel </span>to ask for a ruling. Rabbi Abba bar Memel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Act in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ile’a.</span>
Since the mishna cited a dispute with regard to the conditions under which an owner has acquired the privilege to use a window, the Gemara teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: And </span>if a window was built <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of enabling <span class="gemarra-regular">light </span>to enter a dark room, then the owner of the window <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever </span>size <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not only if it is a large window. And if the neighbor did not protest its construction, he cannot subsequently force the owner of the window to seal it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a projection </span>emerging from the wall of one’s house, overhanging a courtyard, one <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use if it protrudes at least <span class="gemarra-regular">as far as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 59b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can protest </span>its construction. If it protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a handbreadth, </span>the owner of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its </span>use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot protest </span>its construction.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani says, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">established an acquired privilege with regard to</span> a projection of <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">established an acquired privilege with regard to four </span>handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he saying? Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">established an acquired privilege </span>with regard to a projection that measures <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth wide by four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">long</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has <span class="gemarra-regular">established an acquired privilege with regard to </span>extending the projection to <span class="gemarra-regular">a width </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths.
The mishna teaches that if the projection protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a handbreadth </span>the owner of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>means to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">an acquired privilege for its</span> use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot protest. Rav Huna says: They taught only </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the roof </span>cannot protest the actions <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the courtyard, </span>i.e., he may not demand that the owner of the courtyard refrain from construction that interferes with the former’s use of the projection. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can protest </span>the actions <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the roof, </span>and demand that the latter not build a projection of any size, even less than a handbreadth. He can also demand that the owner of the roof not use an existing projection, since it leads to damage caused by sight. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: Even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the courtyard cannot protest </span>the actions <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the roof.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">sight? As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>and therefore the owner of the courtyard can protest, since the owner of the roof has the means to see into the other’s courtyard when using this projection, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>agrees that damage caused by sight <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And </span>Rav Yehuda holds it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different here, as </span>the owner of the roof can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the courtyard: The projection <span class="gemarra-regular">is not suitable for use, </span>since it is too small for me to stand upon and look into the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is it suitable? To hang items on it, </span>and nothing more. <span class="gemarra-regular">I will turn my face </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">and hang </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>without looking into your courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span><span class="it-text">amora</span>, Rav Huna, holds that the owner of the courtyard can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the roof: There may be <span class="gemarra-regular">times when you are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">frightene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> due to the height of the projection, and you will look into my courtyard while using it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not open his windows, </span>i.e., build an opening in a wall to use as a window, <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard belonging to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a courtyard in which he is a partner. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased a house in another, </span>adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not open </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard belonging to partners. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">built a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of his house, he may not open it into a courtyard belonging to partners. Rather, if he desired </span>to build a loft, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a room within his house, or </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a loft on top of his house, and open it into his house, </span>not directly into the courtyard.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling that one may not open a window into a courtyard that he co-owns, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>did the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>render it prohibited for one to open a window <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard belonging to partners? </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>open a window <span class="gemarra-regular">into another’s courtyard either, </span>as it will lead to damage caused by sight.
The Gemara replies that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted for one to open a window <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another’s courtyard, </span>where he is certainly not allowed to look; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>where one wants to open a window <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard belonging to partners, where </span>the owner of the window can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the other partner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">you need to conceal </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">from me </span>and conduct yourself modestly <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard </span>where I too am a partner and have the right to be present, why does it bother you if I open a window into there? Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the partner may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Until now I needed to conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you </span>only when we were both <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard. Now I will need to conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you even in the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as you can see into my house from your window.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a person who opened his window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into a courtyard belonging to partners and came before Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have established an acquired privilege, my son; you have established an acquired privilege, </span>and you may not be prevented from using the windows. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ḥiyya, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">You toiled and opened </span>the windows; you must <span class="gemarra-regular">toil and seal </span>them, as the partners have the right to prevent you from using these windows.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>

Daf 60a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And to seal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if one sealed another’s window in his presence, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an acquired privilege </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">immediatel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to keep the window sealed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is not common </span>behavior for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to have his </span>source of <span class="gemarra-regular">light sealed in his presence and </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">silent. </span>The fact that he did not immediately protest indicates that the one who sealed the window had the legal right to do so unilaterally, or that the owner of the window agreed.
§ The mishna teaches that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased a house in another, </span>adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not open </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard belonging to partners. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>by adding residents to the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">it increases their traffic, </span>and the residents of the courtyard do not wish to be disturbed by additional people passing through.
The Gemara questions this. But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the last clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if he desired </span>to build a loft, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a room within his house, or </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a loft above his house, </span>and have it open into his house, not directly into the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he does so, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t </span>there still a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">it increases the traffic? Rav Huna said </span>as an explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the mishna mean when it says that he may build <span class="gemarra-regular">a room</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>an existing room <span class="gemarra-regular">in two. And what is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">loft </span>to which the mishna is referring? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">an internal story </span>created by dividing an existing space into two stories.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not open an entrance opposite </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entranc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a window opposite </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">window toward a courtyard belonging to partners, </span>so as to ensure that the residents will enjoy a measure of privacy. If there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a small </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enlarge it. </span>If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not fashion it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">two. But </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may open an entrance opposite </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance or a window opposite </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">window toward the public domain. </span>Similarly, if there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a small </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may enlarge it, </span>and if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may fashion it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">two.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>i.e., that one may not open an en-trance opposite another entrance, or a window opposite another window, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe;</span> and the spirit of God came upon him” (Numbers 24:2). The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>was it that Balaam <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>that so inspired him? He <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that the entrances of their tents were not aligned with each other, </span>ensuring that each family enjoyed a measure of privacy. And he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are worthy of having the Divine Presence rest on them.</span>
The mishna teaches that if there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enlarge it. Rami bar Ḥama thought to say </span>this means that if the entrance was the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span>cubits, one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not fashion it </span>to the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of eight </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he would then be allowed to <span class="gemarra-regular">take eight </span>corresponding cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one is entitled to utilize the area of the courtyard up to a depth of four cubits along the width of the opening. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the entrance was the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span>cubits and one wishes <span class="gemarra-regular">to fashion it </span>to the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span>cubits, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>do so, as in any event he already had the right to use an area of four cubits by four cubits in front of the entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>This is not so, as his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I can conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you with </span>there being <span class="gemarra-regular">a small entrance, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">I cannot conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you with </span>there being <span class="gemarra-regular">a large entrance.</span>
The mishna teaches that if there <span class="gemarra-regular">was one </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not fashion it into two. </span>In this case as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thought to say </span>that this means if the entrance was the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span>cubits he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not make it into two </span>openings, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he would then be allowed to <span class="gemarra-regular">take eight </span>corresponding cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard,</span> four for each entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it was the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of eight </span>cubits and he wishes <span class="gemarra-regular">to make it into </span>two openings, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span>cubits, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>do so, as in any event he already had the right to use an area of eight cubits by four cubits in front of his entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>This is not so, as his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I can conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you with </span>there being <span class="gemarra-regular">one entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">I cannot conceal </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from you with </span>there being <span class="gemarra-regular">two entrances.</span>
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may open an entrance opposite </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>or a window opposite another window <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the public domain. </span>Why is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the one who wishes to protest: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, you must conceal yourself from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">people of the public domain. </span>Since you cannot stop them from passing by and therefore cannot engage in behavior that requires privacy with your entrance open, it is of no consequence to you if I open an entrance as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">may not form an </span>empty <span class="gemarra-regular">spac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">be-neath the public domain </span>by digging <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, ditches, or caves. Rabbi Eliezer deems </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for one to do so, provided that he places a covering strong enough that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wagon laden with stones would </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">tread </span>on it without breaking it, therefore ensuring that the empty space will not cause any damage to those in the public domain. One <span class="gemarra-regular">may not extend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">projection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or balconies [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ugzuztraot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain. Rather, if he desired </span>to build one he may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw back into his </span>property by moving his wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and extend </span>the projection to the end of his property line. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there are projections and balconies </span>extending into the public domain, this courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">retains its presumptive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">status</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the owner has the acquired privilege of their use, and the court does not demand their removal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that if the covering of the space is strong enough to support a wagon laden with stones then it is permitted to dig out the empty space, is eminently reasonable; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>what do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>hold? The Gemara answers: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times when </span>the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">erodes </span>over time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not aware, </span>thereby potentially causing damage to those in the public domain.
The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not extend projections or balconies </span>into the public domain. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Am</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a projection that protruded into an alleyway, and a certain man also had a projection that protruded into the public domain, </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">general public was preventing </span>the man from leaving it there, as it interfered with traffic. He <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ami, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go sever </span>your projection.
The man <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master also has </span>a similar projection. Rabbi Ami said to him: It is different, as <span class="gemarra-regular">mine protrudes into an alleyway, </span>where a limited number of people live, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the alleyway waive </span>their right to protest <span class="gemarra-regular">to me. Yours protrudes into the public domain, </span>which does not belong to any specific individuals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">waive </span>their right to protest <span class="gemarra-regular">to you?</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a tree that was leaning into the public domain. </span>There <span class="gemarra-regular">was a certain man who also had a tree that was leaning into the public domain, </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">general public was preventing him </span>from leaving it there, insisting he cut it down, as required by the mishna (27b). He <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yannai, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 60b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Go now, and come tomorrow. At night, </span>Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>and had someone <span class="gemarra-regular">cut </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>tree that belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The next day, </span>that man <span class="gemarra-regular">came before </span>Rabbi Yannai, who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go, cut </span>down your tree. The man <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master also has </span>a tree that leans into the public domain. Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see: If mine is cut </span>down, then <span class="gemarra-regular">cut yours </span>down. <span class="gemarra-regular">If mine is not cut </span>down, <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">cut </span>yours down, either.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">At the outset what did </span>Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">hold, and ultimately, what did he hold? </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">At the outset, he held </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the general public is amenable </span>to having the tree there, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they sit in its shade. Once he saw that </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">preventing </span>someone else who owned a tree from keeping his, he understood that it was only out of respect that they did not object to his tree being there. He therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>someone to <span class="gemarra-regular">cut it </span>down. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> why did he tell the man to return the next day? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Go cut </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then I will cut mine </span>down. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because of </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, who said: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Gather yourselves together and gather [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hitkosheshu</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">vakoshu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Zephaniah 2:1), and this can be explained homiletically to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">Adorn [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keshot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] yourself and afterward adorn others, </span>i.e., act properly before requiring others to do so.
§ The mishna teaches that one may not extend projections or balconies into the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if he desired </span>to build one he may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw back into his </span>property by moving his wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and extend</span> the projection to the end of his property line. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">drew back </span>into his property <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not extend </span>the projection at that time, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">return and extend </span>it at a later date? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">drew back </span>into his property, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may exten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it even later, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Reish Lakish says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">drew back </span>into his property but did not build the projection at that time, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not extend </span>it later.
The Gemara presents an alternative version of the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">to you. To </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">extend </span>a projection, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may extend </span>it, since he is adding within his own property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whether he may <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">walls to their </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">place. And </span>with regard to this disagreement <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not return </span>the walls to their prior place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Reish Lakish says </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may return </span>them.
Rabbi Ya’akov explains their reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not return </span>the walls to their prior place <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a path that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">public has established </span>as a public thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to ruin it, </span>i.e., to prevent people from using it. Once the public has become accustomed to using the place where his wall had stood, he may not repossess that space. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">may return </span>the walls to their prior place, because <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter </span>applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no space, </span>i.e., if he were to move back the wall there would be no space for the public to walk, but <span class="gemarra-regular">here there is space, </span>since they can still walk through the public domain.
The mishna teaches that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased a courtyard in which there are projections and balconies </span>extending into the public domain, this courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">retains its presumptive status, </span>allowing the owner to use the projections. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>If the wall of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">fell, he may return and build i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> as it was, including the projections or balconies.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based on that which is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:17): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not plaster</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one may not tile, and one may not paint [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mefayyeḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> images <span class="gemarra-regular">in the present, </span>as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. But if one <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased a courtyard </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">plastered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tiled, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">painted </span>with images, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">retains its presumptive status, </span>and it is assumed that it was done in a permitted manner. If <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">fell, he may not return and build it </span>in its previous form. This indicates that one may not rebuild a building in a manner that is prohibited, even if there was an acquired privilege to maintain it in that manner.
The Gemara answers: A case of <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>matters <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different, </span>i.e., in the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, he may not rebuild it because it is prohibited for him to do so. In this mishna, the issue is encroachment upon the rights of others, and once he had an acquired privilege to use the projections or balconies, he maintains that right.
§ With regard to the ruling of the above-quoted <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sota</span> 15:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not plaster his house with plaster, but if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed sand or straw into </span>the plaster, which dulls its luster, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed sand into it, it is </span>white <span class="gemarra-regular">cement [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">terakesid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is of a higher quality than standard plaster, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>but if he mixed in <span class="gemarra-regular">straw, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
§ Having mentioned the prohibition against plastering, which is a sign of mourning over the destruction of the Temple, the Gemara discusses related matters. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sota</span> 15:11): <span class="gemarra-regular">When the Temple was destroyed a second </span>time, there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an increase </span>in the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">ascetics among </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews, </span>whose practice was <span class="gemarra-regular">to not eat meat and to not drink wine. Rabbi Yehoshua joined them </span>to discuss their practice. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: My children, for what </span>reason do <span class="gemarra-regular">you not eat meat and </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">you not drink wine? They said to him: Shall we eat meat, from which </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are sacrificed upon </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar, and now </span>the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">has ceased </span>to exist? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we drink wine, which is poured </span>as a libation <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the altar, and now </span>the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">has ceased </span>to exist?
Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: If so, we will not eat bread </span>either, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offerings </span>that were offered upon the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">have ceased. </span>They replied: You are correct. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>to subsist <span class="gemarra-regular">with produce. </span>He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">We will not eat produce </span>either, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the bringing of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have ceased. </span>They replied: You are correct. We will no longer eat the produce of the seven species from which the first fruits were brought, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>to subsist <span class="gemarra-regular">with other produce. </span>He said to them: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we will not drink water, since the water libatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has ceased. They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were silent, </span>as they realized that they could not survive without water.
Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: My children, come, and I will tell you </span>how we should act. <span class="gemarra-regular">To not mourn at all </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">impossible, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">decree was already issued </span>and the Temple has been destroyed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But to mourn excessively </span>as you are doing is also <span class="gemarra-regular">impossible, as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">do not issue a decree upon the public unless a majority of the public is able to abide by it, as it is written: “You are cursed with the curse, yet you rob Me, even this whole nation” </span>(Malachi 3:9), indicating that the prophet rebukes the people for neglecting observances only if they were accepted by the whole nation.
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages said: A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">plaster his house with plaster, but </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">a small amount in it </span>without plaster to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is a small amount? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit by </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit. Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This should be <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the entrance, </span>so that it is visible to all.
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare all </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">needs for a meal, but </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">a small ite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>small item? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>Something akin to <span class="gemarra-regular">small, fried fish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">engage </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">her cosmetic treatments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>she must <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">a small matter </span>to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>small matter? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>She does not remove hair from the place on the <span class="gemarra-regular">temple </span>from which women would remove hair. The source for these practices is a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, </span>if I remember you not; if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy” (Psalms 137:5–6).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Above my highest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] joy? Rav Yitzḥak says: This </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are customarily placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the head [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bridegrooms </span>at the time of their wedding celebrations, to remember the destruction of the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Where are they placed? </span>Abaye replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries </span>are placed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland in place of ashes” </span>(Isaiah 61:3). Since phylacteries are referred to as a garland (see Ezekiel 24:17), it may be inferred from this verse that the ashes were placed in the same place as the phylacteries.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And anyone who mourn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the destruction of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">merit and see its joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, </span>and be glad with her, all that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all that mourn for her” (Isaiah 66:10).
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sota</span> 15:10) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, by right, we should decree upon ourselves not to eat meat and not to drink wine, but </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">issue a decree upon the public unles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from the day that the wicked kingdom, </span>i.e., Rome, <span class="gemarra-regular">spread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who decree evil and harsh decrees upon us, and nullify Torah </span>study <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot for us, and do not allow us to enter </span>the celebration of the first <span class="gemarra-regular">week of a son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., circumcision, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say: To </span>enter the celebration of the <span class="gemarra-regular">salvation of </span>a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by right we should </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">decree upon ourselves not to marry a woman and </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">to produce offspring, and it will turn out </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of Abraham our forefather will ceas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to exist <span class="gemarra-regular">on their own, </span>rather than being forced into a situation where there are sons who are not circumcised.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>concerning a situation such as this, the following principle is applied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave the Jews alone </span>and do not impose decrees by which they cannot abide. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is better that they be unwitting </span>sinners, who do not know that what they are doing is improper considering the circumstances, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not be intentional </span>wrongdoers, who marry and procreate despite knowing that they should not. 


Daf 61a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a house </span>without specifying what is included in the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">has not sold the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gallery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an extension built above or alongside the main building, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the gallery is attached to the house and <span class="gemarra-regular">opens into it. Nor </span>has he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">behind </span>the house, even if it is accessible only from inside the house. He has <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the roof</span>  <span class="gemarra-regular">when it has a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">parape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, </span>as such a roof is considered a separate entity and is therefore not included in the sale of the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: If </span>the parapet <span class="gemarra-regular">has the form of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that is, if it consists of two upright posts with a beam crossing over them, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the parapet <span class="gemarra-regular">is not ten handbreadths high, </span>the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is not sold </span>together with the house, unless it is specifically included in the sale.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a gallery? Here </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">they interpreted </span>this as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an attic [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">a windowed structure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bidka</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> attached to the main building. The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an attic is not sold </span>together with a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so is a windowed structure </span>attached to the house <span class="gemarra-regular">not sold </span>together with a house, as it is certainly considered a separate entity and not part of the main building. But <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>that a gallery is <span class="gemarra-regular">a windowed structure </span>attached to the house, it is only such a structure that is not included in the sale of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">but an attic is sold </span>together with a house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught: </span>A small structure attached to a building <span class="gemarra-regular">has three names </span>in the Bible: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gallery </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yatzia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], side chamber [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Such a structure is called <span class="gemarra-regular">a gallery, as it is written: “The bottommost gallery [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hayyatzia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] was five cubits wide” </span>(I Kings 6:6). It is also called <span class="gemarra-regular">a side chamber, as it is written: “And the side chambers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehatzelaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] were one over another, thirty-three times” </span>(Ezekiel 41:6). Additionally, it is called <span class="gemarra-regular">a cell, as it is written: “And the cell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] was one reed long, and one reed wide; and the space between the cells was five cubits” </span>(Ezekiel 40:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that it can be seen that a small structure attached to a building is called a cell <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>as was taught in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Middot</span> 4:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">The wall of the Sanctuary </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the cell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>in back of it was <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits wide, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall of the cell </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits wide.
§ Relating to the mishna’s statement that a gallery is not included in the sale of a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: And that </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the gallery <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>an area of at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Mar Zutra: According to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you say </span>a gallery is not excluded from the sale of a house <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>in size, there is a difficulty. As <span class="gemarra-regular">if that is so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the exclusion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>or a cistern from the sale of a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">about which we learned </span>in a mishna (64a): One who sells a house has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the pit nor the cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if he writes for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">him the depth and the height </span>of the house; <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>should we say that only <span class="gemarra-regular">if they have </span>an area of at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits, yes, </span>they are excluded from the sale of the house, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, no, </span>they are not excluded? This is difficult, as a pit is not four cubits wide, and consequently, it would never be excluded.
Mar Zutra responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in that mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the excavations, have <span class="gemarra-regular">a discrete use, </span>to store water, and they cannot possibly be used as living quarters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the house, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a discrete use, </span>to serve as living quarters, and so they are considered separate entities even if the excavation is not four cubits wide. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of a gallery, both <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the gallery, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">have the same use, </span>and so <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the gallery <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>it is deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">significant </span>and considered a separate entity, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>four by four cubits, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">significant </span>in its own right, but simply another part of the house.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a house without specifying what is included in the sale has not sold the gallery, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>has he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the room behind </span>the house, even if it is accessible only <span class="gemarra-regular">from it. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that the mishna taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">a galler</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not sold </span>along with the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">a room </span>behind the house is not included in such a sale? 

Daf 61b

<span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that the room behind the house is excluded from the sale of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">delineate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the boundaries </span>of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale by listing places <span class="gemarra-regular">outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the room, e.g., noting the houses that border the property being sold. Even though this might suggest that the room is included in the sale, the mishna teaches that it is not.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a residence to another in a large building [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> containing several residences, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he delineates for him the external boundaries </span>of the large building, he did not sell him the entire building, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he enlarged </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">the boundaries for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, the seller did not mean to delineate the precise borders of what he was selling; rather, he delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, giving the general location of the specific residence subject to the transaction.
With regard to Rav Naḥman’s statement, the Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we say </span>that this is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they call a residence a residence, and a building a building, </span>and they always differentiate between the two terms, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he did not intend to sell him the entire building but merely enlarged upon the boundaries for him, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold him a residence </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not sell him a large building. Rather, </span>explain that this is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they also call a building a residence. </span>But in that case, why not say that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him the entire </span>building, since he delineated the external boundaries of the large building?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rav Naḥman’s ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where most </span>of the people <span class="gemarra-regular">call a residence a residence, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a building </span>they call <span class="gemarra-regular">a building, but there are also </span>some people <span class="gemarra-regular">who call a building a residence. Lest you say </span>that since the seller delineated the building’s external boundaries, this indicates that he meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">sell him the entire </span>building, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not so. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span>if the seller intended to sell him the entire building, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have written </span>in the bill of sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I have not withheld anything </span>for myself <span class="gemarra-regular">in this sale, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not write </span>this clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">withheld </span>something for himself and did not mean to sell everything located within the delineated boundaries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a similar fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a field to another in a large expanse of fields</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if he delineates for him the external boundaries </span>of the large expanse of fields he did not sell him the entire expanse of fields; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he enlarged </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">the boundaries for him. </span>That is, the seller did not mean to delineate the precise borders of what was being sold; rather, he delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, giving the general location of the particular field he was selling.
The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that this is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they call a field a field, and an expanse of fields an expanse of fields, </span>and always differentiate between the two terms, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>the he did not intend to sell him the entire expanse of fields, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold him a field </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not sell him an expanse of fields. Rather, </span>explain that this is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they also call an expanse of fields a field. </span>But in that case, why not say that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him the entire </span>expanse of fields, since he delineated the external boundaries of the expanse of fields?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rav Naḥman’s ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are </span>some people <span class="gemarra-regular">who call a field a field, and an expanse of fields </span>they call <span class="gemarra-regular">an expanse of fields, but there are also </span>some people <span class="gemarra-regular">who call an expanse of fields a field. Lest you say </span>that since the seller delineated the expanse’s external boundaries, this indicates that he meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">sell him the entire </span>expanse, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not so. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span>if the seller intended to sell him the entire expanse, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have written for him </span>in the bill of sale: And <span class="gemarra-regular">I have not withheld anything for myself in this sale, but </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not write </span>this clause <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, conclude from it </span>that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">withheld </span>something for himself and did not mean to sell everything located within the delineated boundaries.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for Rav Naḥman to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in both cases, even though the two rulings appear to be the same. <span class="gemarra-regular">As had he taught us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, </span>that he did not sell him the entire building even if he delineated the building’s external boundaries, I might have said that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that this, </span>the residence, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a discrete use, </span>separate from that of the rest of the building, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the building, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a discrete use. But </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">an expanse of fields, all of which has a single use, </span>since it can be sown with grain in its entirety, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him the entire </span>expanse.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an expanse of fields, </span>that he did not sell him the entire expanse even if he delineated its external boundaries, I might have said that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">had no </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">to delineate </span>the particular field’s boundaries, since all of the fields are similar, and they all belong to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence, with regard to which </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>a way <span class="gemarra-regular">to delineate </span>its borders, through the use of descriptive terms that would isolate it from the rest of the building, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not delineate </span>them, I might say that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold him the entire </span>building. Therefore, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to mention both cases explicitly.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Abaye: One who sells something to another must write for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in the bill of sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have not withheld anything for myself in this sale. In accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with whose </span>opinion is that? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says </span>that even when the seller delineates the boundaries of what he is selling, he does not necessarily mean to sell everything included within those boundaries. Inserting this clause in the bill of sale removes uncertainties that could lead to conflict.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: I am selling you land of the house of Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two </span>plots of <span class="gemarra-regular">land that were called </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of Ḥiyya, </span>and the Sages deliberated as to whether both were included in this sale or only one. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: He said to him </span>that he was selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>plot of land, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say to him </span>that he was selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>plots of land, as he employed a singular term. Therefore, only one is included in the sale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to him: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, without specifying </span>how many, <span class="gemarra-regular">the minimum </span>number of fields that would justify being called <span class="gemarra-regular">fields </span>in the plural is <span class="gemarra-regular">two, </span>and therefore the seller has to give the buyer only two of his fields, even if he owns many fields. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to him: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of my <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, </span>what he means is that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">all the fields that he owns, excluding </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">orchards [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bustanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and vineyards. And if he said to him: </span>I am selling you my <span class="gemarra-regular">landed property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> what he means is that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">orchards and vineyards, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">houses and </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves. </span>

Daf 62a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to him: </span>I am selling you my <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>it means that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">houses and </span>his Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves.</span>
§ The Gemara continues its examination of the concept of delineating boundaries in a wide manner, and considers the following case: If in the bill of sale the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">delineated one boundary line </span>on one side of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">long, and the other boundary line </span>on the opposite side of the field he delineated <span class="gemarra-regular">short, Rav said: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires only </span>a width of land <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the short </span>border, as it is assumed that the short boundary line delineates the actual size of the field that was sold to him, while the long boundary line was merely intended to point to the field under discussion. That is to say, the seller delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, but did not intend to include everything found within those boundaries in the sale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But let him </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the triangular plot [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rosh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> bounded by the diagonal line connecting the end of the short border and the end of the long border. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was silent </span>and did not respond.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a boundary line </span>defined by the fields <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reuven and Shimon on one side </span>of the field being sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a boundary line </span>defined by the fields <span class="gemarra-regular">of Levi and Yehuda on the other side, </span>and in the bill of sale the seller describes the field being sold as bordered by the fields of Reuven and Shimon on one side but mentions only the field of Levi on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>had he intended to sell only half the field <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have written for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale that the field is bordered by the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reuven </span>on the one side, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Lev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> on the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>by the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shimon </span>on the one side, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Yehuda </span>on the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not write </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it that he is telling him </span>that he is selling him not only the area between the fields of Reuven and Levi, but also <span class="gemarra-regular">the triangular plot </span>bounded by the diagonal line connecting the end of Shimon’s field to the end of Levi’s field.
The Gemara continues: If the field being sold is <span class="gemarra-regular">bounded by </span>the fields of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the east and the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">bounded by </span>the fields of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the north and the south, </span>it is not enough to designate the field for the buyer as the field between the fields of Reuven and Shimon, but <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary to write for him </span>in the bill of sale that the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">bounded by </span>the fields of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">two sides, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">bounded by </span>the fields of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">two sides. </span>Otherwise, all that the buyer acquires is a triangular plot bounded by one of Reuven’s fields and one of Shimon’s fields, and the boundary is the diagonal line connecting the end of Reuven’s field to the end of Shimon’s field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">defined for </span>the buyer only <span class="gemarra-regular">the corners </span>of the field being sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does this mean that he is selling him only the corners of the field or the entire field marked by those corners? A second dilemma was also raised: If he defined the boundaries of the field in a shape <span class="gemarra-regular">resembling </span>the Greek letter <span class="gemarra-regular">gamma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or the English letter L, noting the boundaries on two adjacent sides that meet at a right angle, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does this mean that he is selling him the entire field, or only the triangular plot marked by those boundaries and the diagonal line running from the end of one to the end of the other? 

Daf 62b

A third dilemma was also raised before the Sages: If the seller defined the boundaries of the property he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alternating </span>fashion, mentioning only some of the fields bordering each side of the field being sold, while omitting others, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? No resolution was found for these questions, and these dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The Gemara raises a similar dilemma. If, in the bill of sale, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">delineated for </span>the buyer the field’s <span class="gemarra-regular">first boundary, </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">second boundary, and </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">third boundary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he did not delineate </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth boundary </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the entire </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the one furrow along which <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth boundary </span>runs, which is usually differentiated in some way from the field itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>The buyer acquires <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the furrow along which <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth boundary </span>runs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Asi says: He acquires only </span>the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">one furro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> along the entire </span>perimeter of the three boundaries specified by the seller.
The Gemara explains Rav Asi’s opinion: He <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who said </span>that by failing to delineate the fourth boundary, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">withheld </span>some part of the field, i.e., one furrow, for himself. But Rav Asi takes this further <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he withheld </span>some part of the field for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span>fourth <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary, he withheld also </span>some portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the entire </span>field, and therefore the buyer acquires only that which is adjacent to the specified boundaries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the entire </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the one furrow along which <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth boundary </span>runs, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is not include</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> within the space between two adjacent boundaries, but rather juts out beyond them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it is included </span>within the space delineated by the other boundaries, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it as well.
Rava adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even when it is not included </span>in that space, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that the buyer does not acquire it <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a row of trees on it, or it is </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no row of trees on it, and it is not </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it along with the rest of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>one derives from here <span class="gemarra-regular">that when </span>the fourth border <span class="gemarra-regular">is included </span>within the space delineated by the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if there is a row of trees on it and it is </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that Rava’s ruling and the conclusion drawn from it are as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the entire </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he acquires <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the furrow along which <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth boundary </span>runs, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is included </span>within the space delineated by the two adjacent boundaries. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not included </span>within those boundaries, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it.
Rava adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even when it is included </span>within the adjoining boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that the buyer acquires it <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no row of trees on it, and it is not </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a row of trees on it, or it is </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>one derives from here <span class="gemarra-regular">that when </span>the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is not included </span>within the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if there is no row of trees on it and it is not </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We conclude according to both versions </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava that </span>even if the seller withheld something for himself along the fourth boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not withhold anything at all in the field </span>itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we also conclude </span>according to both versions <span class="gemarra-regular">that where </span>the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is included </span>within the space defined by the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is no row of trees on it and it is not </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it. And furthermore, we conclude according to both versions that if the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is not included </span>within the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is a row of trees on it, or it is </span>an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it.
If the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is included </span>within the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is </span>a row of trees <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>or it is fit for sowing nine <span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed, or if the fourth boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">is not included </span>within the two adjacent boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is no </span>row of trees <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>nor is it fit for sowing nine <span class="it-text">kav</span>, the ruling in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated in this direction, </span>that the land adjacent to the fourth boundary is acquired by the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was stated in that direction, </span>that this land is not acquired by the buyer, depending upon which version of Rava’s statement is accepted. Since there is no clear ruling in these cases, the decision is left to <span class="gemarra-regular">the discretion of the judges</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who must rule in accordance with what appears to them to be the intention of the seller.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>If one owns a field in partnership with another, and he says to a third person: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">the half that I have in this land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he means to sell him <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of that field, i.e., his entire share. If he says to the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">half of the land that I have, </span>he means to sell him <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter </span>of that field, i.e., half of his share. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>wording <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>wording, that you rule differently in the two cases? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent, </span>offering no reply.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: I had assumed that since he was silent, he </span>must have <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>my opinion and retracted his statement; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. </span>As on another occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">I saw certain bills </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">that issued from </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">Master’s house,</span> that is, they were issued under the auspices of my master Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it was written: The half that I have in this land, </span>and it was clear from another clause in the bill that <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the field was being sold. And there was another bill of sale in which it was written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Half of the land that I have, </span>and it was clear from another clause in the bill that <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter </span>of the field was being sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If one sold land to another and delineated boundaries on three sides of the field, and with regard to the fourth side he wrote in the bill of sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">The boundary </span>of the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">the land through which </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is halved, </span>he has sold him <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the field. If he writes with regard to the fourth boundary: <span class="gemarra-regular">The boundary </span>of the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">the land from which </span>a plot <span class="gemarra-regular">can be set apart, </span>he has sold him only an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, as that is the minimum size of a plot of land defined as a field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>wording, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>wording, that you rule differently in the two cases? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent, </span>and did not respond. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">understood from this </span>silence that Abaye understood that Rabba retracted his ruling and conceded that in both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, the buyer acquires <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the field. 

Daf 63a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, as Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said: </span>The matter <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me by Abaye, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whether </span>the seller writes with regard to the fourth boundary: <span class="gemarra-regular">The boundary </span>of the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">the land through which </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is halved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>he writes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The boundary </span>of the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">the land through which </span>a plot <span class="gemarra-regular">can be set apart, if he said to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are its boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has sold him <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the field. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are its boundaries, </span>he has sold him only an area fit for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed.
§ The Gemara raises a question about a similar case: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: So-and-so should share in my property, </span>he means to give him <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the property. If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give so-and-so a portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of my property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? What portion of the property must he give him?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina bar Kisi said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof concerning the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: Give so-and-so a portion of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for his water needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos says: </span>He must give him <span class="gemarra-regular">not less than one-quarter </span>of the water in the cistern. If he qualifies his words and says: Give so-and-so a portion of my cistern’s water <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel, </span>he must give him <span class="gemarra-regular">not less than one-eighth </span>of the water. If he says: Give him a portion <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">pot, </span>he must give him <span class="gemarra-regular">not less than one-twelfth </span>of the water. And if he says: Give him <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">cup</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he must give him <span class="gemarra-regular">not less than one-sixteenth </span>of the water. In any event, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that the unqualified phrase: Give so-and-so a portion, should be understood to mean: Give him one-quarter.
The Gemara now considers another case in which the seller withholds something for himself in a sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Levit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who sold a field to an Israelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said to him: </span>I am selling you this field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that the first tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from the produce growing in the field, which must be given to a Levite, is <span class="gemarra-regular">mine, </span>and it will be given to me every year and not to any other Levite, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first tithe is his. And if he said: </span>I am selling you the field on the condition that the tithe will be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to me and to my sons, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he dies, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must give </span>the tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">to his sons.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: This stipulation will remain in force <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as this field is in your possession, </span>then if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it and</span> afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">bought it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">again, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">on him. </span>Since the field left the buyer’s possession in the interim, the seller no longer has a claim to the tithe.
The Gemara challenges the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should the seller ever have a right to the tithe after he has sold the field? After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person cannot transfer ownership </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an object</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How, then, can the seller acquire a portion of the produce that does not yet exist? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling you this field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that the first tithe </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">mine, </span>it is as if <span class="gemarra-regular">he withheld the site </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>is grown for himself when he sold the field, and that site already exists.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: That is to say </span>that with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a house to another and says to him: </span>I am selling you this house <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that the upper story [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyota</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is mine, the upper story is his. </span>

Daf 63b

<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> did Reish Lakish say this? In any case the upper story is his, as when he sold the house, it was only the lower story that he sold to the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: </span>He said this to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to extend </span>from the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">projection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> over the courtyard, which was included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may extend </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>He said this to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>this upper story collapses and the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to build an upper story on top of it </span>to replace it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may build </span>it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Zevid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>explanation is consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches, </span>which begins with: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is to say. </span>As according to Rav Zevid, Reish Lakish infers from the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> about tithes that even though the seller of the house did not explicitly withhold anything for himself, the court interprets his use of his superfluous stipulation as an indication that he wished to withhold for himself the space over the courtyard for the projections. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Pappa, what </span>did Reish Lakish mean when he said his statement that begins with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is to say? </span>The seller’s right to rebuild the upper story after it collapses is not derived from the superfluous stipulation that he attached to the transaction, and it is not inferred from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, Rav Pappa’s interpretation is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it does not account for the wording of Reish Lakish’s statement.
§ The Gemara discusses what is included in the wordings of various contracts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who sells a house to another </span>and wants the sale to include the entire property, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he writes for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">the depth and the heigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of the house, he <span class="gemarra-regular">must </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">write for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Acquire for yourself </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the depth of the earth up to the height of the sky. What is the reason </span>for this addition? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire the depth and the height </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">specification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore, unless the matter has been explicitly stipulated, the buyer may not dig under the house or build above it. The words: <span class="gemarra-regular">The depth and the height, effect the acquisition of the depth and the height </span>of the house for the buyer, allowing him to dig below or build above the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the additional phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the depth of the earth up to the height of the sky, effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the acquisition of the pit and the cistern and the tunnel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> associated with the house.
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the mishna (64a) <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rav Dimi’s opinion: One who sells a house has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the pit nor the cistern, even if he writes for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">him the depth and the height </span>of the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">As if it enters your mind </span>to say that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the depth and the height </span>of the house even <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">specification </span>that the depth and the height of the house are included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">the depth and the height effect the acquisition of the pit and the cistern and the tunnels, </span>as he attached an additional stipulation to the transaction. The Gemara rejects this opinion: The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write </span>these words <span class="gemarra-regular">for him.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this line of reasoning is difficult, as the mishna explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the pit and the cistern are not sold <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">writes for </span>the buyer that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>the depth and the height of the house. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even though </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write </span>these words <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>in the bill of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquiring the depth and the height </span>of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as if he wrote </span>them, as it is assumed that they were omitted by accident. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquiring the pit and the cistern and the tunnels, if </span>the seller explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote for him </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">the depth and the height, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if he did not write </span>that phrase in the bill of sale, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>them. No proof can be derived from this mishna.
§ The Gemara now considers a different mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was taught in the mishna (61a): One who sells his house without explicitly stating what is included in the sale has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the roof </span>along with the house <span class="gemarra-regular">when it has a parapet ten handbreadths high, </span>as such a roof is considered a separate entity and is not included in the sale of the house. 

Daf 64a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that when a house is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the depth and the height </span>of the house, then even <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>it has a parapet <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, what of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why shouldn’t the buyer acquire the roof? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the parapet <span class="gemarra-regular">is ten handbreadths high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is significant </span>in its own right, and therefore, unless it is specifically included in the sale, the buyer does not acquire such a roof along with the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Reish Lakish says: That is to say </span>that with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a house to another and says to him: </span>I am selling you this house <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that the upper story is mine, the upper story is his. And </span>in the Gemara’s examination of Reish Lakish’s statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said: With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> did Reish Lakish say this? In any case the upper story is his, as when he sold the house it was only the lower story that he sold to the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: </span>He said this to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to extend from </span>the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">projections </span>over the courtyard, which was included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may extend </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>He said this to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>this upper story collapses and the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to build an upper story on top of it </span>to replace it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may build </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that when a house is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the depth and the height of a house, Rav Pappa’s statement is puzzling. As <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the seller to stipulate that he is selling the house <span class="gemarra-regular">on the conditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that the upper story is his when in any event the space above the house remains in the seller’s possession? The Gemara answers: Stipulating that he is selling the house <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that the upper story is his <span class="gemarra-regular">benefits him </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">collapses, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">rebuild it. </span>Without this stipulation the seller could not rebuild it, even if the sale did not include the depth and the height of the house.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who sells a house without specification has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the cistern [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he writes for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">him the depth and the height </span>of the house, as anything that is not part of the house, like pits and cisterns, must be explicitly mentioned in the contract or else they remain in the seller’s possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must purchase for himself a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his, because he has sold the area of the house along with the house itself, and he no longer has permission to walk there. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain, as this is certainly included in what he has withheld for himself from the sale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you this house <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from </span>the pit and the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain. Since the seller unnecessarily emphasized that the pit and the cistern are not included in the sale, he presumably intended to reserve for himself the right of access to them.
If the seller kept the house, but <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the pit and the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">sat </span>and examined the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">and posed a difficulty: A pit is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why, then, was it necessary to mention both of them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava Tosfa’a said to Ravina: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both a pit and a cistern </span>are dug out <span class="gemarra-regular">in the ground; </span>the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>is constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">through digging </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">while a cistern </span>is subsequently finished on the inside <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buildin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> masonry walls. It is similarly related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">sat and posed a difficulty: A pit is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern. Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both a pit and a cistern </span>are dug <span class="gemarra-regular">in the ground, </span>the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>is constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">through digging </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">while a cistern </span>is subsequently finished on the inside <span class="gemarra-regular">by building </span>masonry walls.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not </span>purchase such a path. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not about this </span>issue, which will immediately be explained, that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>

Daf 64b

<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who sells, sells generously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that whatever is not explicitly excluded from the sale is assumed to be sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">while the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells sparingly,</span> so that whatever is not explicitly included in the sale is assumed to be unsold. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is also stated generally: Rabbi Akiva </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> generously, </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here.</span>
The Gemara rejects this opinion and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you arrive at such a conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis do not disagree whether, in principle, a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly, but rather their disagreement is limited to this specific case. As <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not want to spend his money </span>on the purchase of a house <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then have <span class="gemarra-regular">others tread upon his </span>property, and therefore he says that the seller must purchase for himself a path through the buyer’s domain to reach his pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not want to receive money </span>for the sale of his house <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then have to <span class="gemarra-regular">fly through the ai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in order to reach his pit, and therefore they say that the seller presumably withheld for himself a path to his pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from the last clause </span>of the mishna, which states: If the seller kept the house but <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the pit and the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain. The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> seem to disagree as to whether a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly.
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps they disagree about </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the intention of the buyer, </span>as we assume that he would not have bought the pit if he would have to fly through the air to get there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the intention of the seller, </span>as presumably he would not have sold the pit if the buyer had the right to tread upon the seller’s property to reach it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof that these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>mishna (71a), which teaches: One who sells a field, even if he states that he is selling everything in it to the buyer, has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the cistern, nor the winepress</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor the dovecote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">abandoned or utilized, </span>as these items are not part of the field itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must purchase </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a path </span>through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And the Rabbis say: </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not </span>purchase a path through the buyer’s domain.
The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>seeing that this case involving the sale of a field appears to be identical to that involving the sale of a house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not teaching us that Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> generously, </span>and therefore the seller must purchase for himself a path to his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">while the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells sparingly, </span>and therefore the purchase of such a path is not necessary?
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the first mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>this dispute with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, and </span>the later mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>this dispute with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field. And </span>while this may seem redundant, both rulings are <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he desires privac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> there. And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that in the absence of an explicit stipulation, the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, </span>which is exposed to all, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the buyer is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>concerned about privacy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, </span>I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his field, <span class="gemarra-regular">because treading </span>upon the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is detrimental to it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>which is not adversely affected by treading through it, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the buyer is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>opposed to the seller passing through.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of that mishna (71a), which teaches: But if the seller kept the field but <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the cistern and winepress <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought, since a seller sells generously. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: He must </span>purchase for himself a path through the seller’s domain.
The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I also </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>seeing as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case involving the sale of a pit or a winepress in a field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>involving the sale of a pit or a cistern in a house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not teaching u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sells, sells sparingly? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the latter clauses of these <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> that this is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree about how the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be decided with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>

Daf 65a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis, while Rav Yirmeya bar Abb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said to Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But many times I said before Rav </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, and never did he say anything to me, </span>which indicates that he holds that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva and not that of the Rabbis. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: How did you teach </span>the mishna before Rav? Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I taught </span>it with <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite </span>attributions, that is to say, the opinion that is attributed in the mishna to Rabbi Akiva, I would teach in the name of the Rabbis. Rav Huna said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to that </span>reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">he never said anything to you, </span>as Rav agreed with the version that you attributed to Rabbi Akiva.
With regard to the opinions of Rav and Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Shall we say </span>that Rav and Shmuel, in their opinions stated with regard to this matter, each <span class="gemarra-regular">follow their </span>general lines of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as they appear to have disagreed about this same issue in another context as well?
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> their father’s estate between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have </span>a right of <span class="gemarra-regular">way against each other, </span>i.e., to walk through the other’s property to reach his own, even though this is how the place was used in their father’s lifetime; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">ladders against each other, </span>i.e., the right to set up a ladder in the other’s property in order to get to his own; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">windows against each other, </span>i.e., the right to prevent the other from building a wall facing his windows; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>do they have the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel against each other, </span>i.e., the right to pass a water channel through the other’s property.
Rav Naḥman continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And be careful with these </span>rulings, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are established </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rav says: They do </span>retain all of these privileges. Consequently, Rav and Shmuel appear to be following their general lines of reasoning here, as Shmuel holds that when the brothers, who are like sellers, divide their father’s estate, they transfer property to each other generously without retaining privileges in each other’s property, while Rav holds that they transfer the property sparingly.
The Gemara comments: Nevertheless, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this disagreement in both cases, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the one case cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">As had we been taught </span>this dispute only <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case, of the brothers who divided their father’s estate, I would have said that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">does Rav say </span>that they retain all of the earlier privileges, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>one brother can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">I wish to live in </span>this house <span class="gemarra-regular">just as my ancestors, </span>who had all of those privileges, <span class="gemarra-regular">lived in it. Know </span>that there is substance to this claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons” </span>(Psalms 45:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">But in this </span>case of an ordinary house sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">say that he concedes to Shmuel </span>that a seller sells generously.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case of an ordinary house sale, I would have said that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">does Shmuel say </span>that a seller sells generously and does not withhold a path for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in that </span>case, of the brothers who divided their father’s estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">say that he concedes to Rav </span>that the desire to live there just as his ancestors did supersedes the seller’s general tendency to sell generously. Therefore, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this dispute in both cases.
As for the ruling itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who was a disciple of Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Huna: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with our opinion, or is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with your opinion? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with your opinion, as you are near the gate of the Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where the judges are </span>frequently <span class="gemarra-regular">found, </span>and therefore you are more proficient in monetary law.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two residences, one </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">behind the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the owner transferred ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two of them, </span>each one to a different person, <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">sale, </span>or if he transferred ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two of them, </span>each to a different person, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, they do not have </span>a right of <span class="gemarra-regular">way against each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>That is, the one who acquired the inner residence may not pass through the outer residence, since each of them received equal privileges from the previous owner. And <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>is this the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>residence was transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a gift, and the inner </span>residence was transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a sale, </span>as it may be assumed that a gift is made in a more generous manner than is a sale.
As for the case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>residence was transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a sale, and the inner </span>residence was transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a gift, </span>some Sages at first <span class="gemarra-regular">understood from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have a </span>right of <span class="gemarra-regular">way against each other, </span>that is, that the recipient of the inner residence may not pass through the outer residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (71a): <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that these items are excluded, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who sells </span>a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to one who gives </span>it away as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, </span>it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives all of it, </span>including everything found in the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, one who gives </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift gives </span>it more <span class="gemarra-regular">generously </span>than does one who sells it, as gifts are generally given to friends to whom one wishes to transfer as many privileges as possible. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift gives </span>it more <span class="gemarra-regular">generously </span>than does one who sells it, and so the recipient of the inner residence acquires a right of way through the outer apartment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has, </span>as part of the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the door, but not the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">key</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">He has sold the mortar that is fixed </span>in the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the portable </span>one. <span class="gemarra-regular">He has sold the </span>immovable <span class="gemarra-regular">lower millstone [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’itzterobil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the </span>portable <span class="gemarra-regular">upper stone [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakelet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the funnel into which one pours the grain to be ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the double stove,</span> as they are deemed movable. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and everything that is in it, </span>

Daf 65b

<span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>components <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>as part of the sale of the house.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> that distinguishes between different types of household items <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. As if </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (78b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sold a vineyard, he has sold </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">the utensils of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> including the movable ones? The same should be true for the sale of a house.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a vineyard, the reference is to utensils that are <span class="gemarra-regular">fixe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the vineyard and never removed from it, and therefore they are included in the sale, while <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of a house, the mishna is referring to utensils that are <span class="gemarra-regular">not fixed </span>in the house, and therefore they are not part of the sale. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">a key in similar fashion to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">the door, </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a door </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed </span>in the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, a key </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is clear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 3:1): One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a house has sold the door and the door bolt and the lock, but </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the key. He has sold the morta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was hollowed out </span>of the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>the mortar <span class="gemarra-regular">that was fixed </span>to the ground after its construction. <span class="gemarra-regular">He has sold the </span>immovable <span class="gemarra-regular">lower millstone but not the </span>portable <span class="gemarra-regular">upper stone. </span>And he has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the oven, nor the double stove, nor the hand mill. Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">attached to the ground is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like the ground </span>and included in the sale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in it, all these </span>components <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>along with the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Both </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not sell the pit or the cistern or the gallery, </span>as they are considered separate entities that are not at all part of the house.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A duc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one hollowed ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and afterward attached </span>to the ground or to a building <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates a ritual bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> through the water it channels to the bath. The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel. By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one attached it </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath. </span>Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? It appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, nor </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the question: To <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>is this referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is referring to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>in the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>that any item attached to the ground is considered part of the house and is sold along with it, there is a difficulty. As <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps this is the reasoning </span>employed in the dispute with regard to the sale of a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Eliezer holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generousl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> anything that is attached to the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">while the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells sparingly, </span>selling only utensils that serve an intrinsic function in the house and nothing else, even if they are attached to the ground. But this teaches us nothing about the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis with respect to a ritual bath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>the reference must be to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer concerning a beehive. As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 10:7): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a beehive </span>attached to the ground by clay, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: It is like land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">one may write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from canceling an outstanding debt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>based <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it. </span>Such a document cannot be written unless the borrower owns some land, and a beehive is considered like land for this purpose. 

Daf 66a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>such a beehive <span class="gemarra-regular">is not susceptible to ritual impurity </span>as long as it is fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">in its place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And one who removes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>as he is likened to one who harvests produce attached to the ground.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: </span>Such a beehive <span class="gemarra-regular">is not like land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not write a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it, and it is susceptible to ritual impurity </span>even when it is fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">in its place, and one who removes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from bringing a sin-offering. This mishna suggests that Rabbi Eliezer holds that a vessel that was affixed to the ground is considered like land for all purposes. This contradicts the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that if one hollowed out a pipe and then affixed it to the ground, it is still considered a vessel, and water flowing through it is considered drawn water that invalidates a ritual bath. This indicates that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara rejects this opinion, stating that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer treats the beehive like land for <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason that Rabbi Elazar stated, </span>and not because he holds that all vessels that are affixed to the ground are considered like land. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Elazar stated: What is the reasoning for </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer </span>with regard to one who removes honey from a beehive? His rationale is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“And he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and dipped it in the honeycomb </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ya’arat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hadevash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(I Samuel 14:27).
Rabbi Eliezer understands that since the Hebrew words used here for honeycomb can also mean honey forest, the verse comes to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who picks </span>anything from a tree <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, so too, </span>with regard to a beehive containing <span class="gemarra-regular">honey, one who removes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabbat </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>as the beehive is treated like land. Consequently, Rabbi Eliezer relies here on a special derivation, which does not necessarily apply to other vessels. Therefore, nothing can be learned from this about Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion with regard to the pipe in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reference with regard to the hollowed-out duct must be to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer concerning </span>a baker’s <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>on which he kneads the dough, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 15:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a baker’s board [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">daf</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shel</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">naḥtomin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was affixed to the wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">not susceptible to ritual impurity, while the Rabbis render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>This seems to indicate that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, anything that is affixed to the ground or to something else that is affixed to the ground is treated like land, and therefore it cannot become ritually impure.
Having concluded that this is the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis that was referred to previously, the Gemara repeats the question raised earlier about the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to a duct: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is it? It appears to be neither that of Rabbi Eliezer nor that of the Rabbis. As <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if one hollowed out </span>a duct <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he fixed it </span>to the ground, water flowing through it should not be considered drawn water that invalidates a ritual bath, as according to Rabbi Eliezer, a baker’s board that was first a vessel, but then became fixed in a wall, is treated like land. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed </span>the duct to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward he hollowed it out, </span>the duct should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be treated like a vessel, and the water flowing through it should be considered drawn water, as the Rabbis do not differentiate with regard to the stage at which the baker’s board was affixed to the wall.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>one can explain that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, but </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">flat wooden vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> without a receptacle, such as a baker’s board, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as </span>they are vessels susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but by Torah law they are not vessels susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer agrees that when the baker’s board is affixed to the wall, it is no longer subject to the rabbinic decree. A hollowed-out duct, however, is a vessel susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law, and it remains so even if afterward it was affixed to the ground. Therefore, the water flowing through it invalidates a ritual bath.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>from the fact that Rabbi Eliezer is more stringent in the case of the duct and distinguishes between a duct that was first hollowed out and only afterward affixed to the ground, and one that was first affixed to the ground and only afterward hollowed out, does it not follow <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn </span>water, i.e., that drawn water added to a ritual bath that does not already contain the necessary quantity of water invalidates it, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law? </span>

Daf 66b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we maintain </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that drawn water invalidates a ritual bath applies only by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>decree. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, doesn’t Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a board of metal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and a metal vessel, even if it is flat and lacks a receptacle, is susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law? This means that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, even a vessel that is susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law loses its status as a vessel when it is affixed to the ground. Consequently, the question returns: Whose opinion is cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that if one first hollowed out a duct and afterward fixed it to the ground, it is still considered a vessel and water flowing through it invalidates a ritual bath, but if he first fixed it to the ground and afterward hollowed it out, the water flowing through it does not invalidate a ritual bath?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>one can explain that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who deem the baker’s metal board susceptible to ritual impurity even when it is fixed to a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn </span>water added to a deficient ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, </span>because drawn water invalidates a deficient ritual bath only <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the Rabbis were lenient.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one first <span class="gemarra-regular">hollowed out </span>the duct <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward fixed it </span>to the ground, water flowing through it should not invalidate the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, </span>where the duct was hollowed out before being affixed to the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the duct <span class="gemarra-regular">had the status of a vesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when </span>it was still <span class="gemarra-regular">detached </span>from the ground, and therefore the Rabbis were not willing to be lenient to such an extent and rule that water flowing through the duct does not invalidate a ritual bath.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">rainwater </span>that was falling and the owner consciously <span class="gemarra-regular">desired </span>that it should fall <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it would wash </span>his immovable <span class="gemarra-regular">lower millstones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the seeds </span>in the millstones? The verse “But if any water be put upon the seed…it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38) teaches that seeds and other food become susceptible to ritual purity only after they have been detached from the ground, and water, or another of the seven liquids specified in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Makhshirin</span> 6:4), has been put on them. The food must be exposed to the liquid willfully by the owner; that is, he must desire or at least be pleased that the food should become wet. Rav Yosef asks about a case where the owner wants the rain to fall on the millstones: Does that water make the seeds upon which it falls susceptible to ritual impurity?
The Gemara clarifies Rav Yosef’s question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not raise this dilemma according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer, who says: Anything attached to the ground </span>has the same legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">as the ground. </span>Since the lower millstones are attached to the ground, they therefore have the same legal status as the ground, and water that falls on the ground, even if it is pleasing to the owner, does not make food susceptible to ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">When should you raise this dilemma? </span>Raise it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, who say: </span>It does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have the same legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">as the ground. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with respect to imparting susceptibility to ritual impurity? The Gemara concludes: An answer to this question was not found; therefore, the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabba son of Rav Huna the Short at Neharde’a: When this woman </span>bearing this letter <span class="gemarra-regular">comes before you, </span>

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, 3:1): One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a courtyard has sold </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer houses </span>that can be accessed directly from the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the inner houses </span>that can be entered only via the outer houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the area of the sand fields [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uveit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">haḥolsaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As for the <span class="gemarra-regular">stores, </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">that open into </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with it; </span>those that <span class="gemarra-regular">do not open into it, </span>but rather open into the public domain, even if they are located in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with it; </span>and those that <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">into this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and into that </span>other public domain are grouped together with those that open into this courtyard alone, and both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those are sold with it. Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a courtyard </span>without specifying what is included in the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold only the open space of the courtyard.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Stores that <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">into this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and into that </span>public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the courtyard. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that such stores <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sold with </span>the courtyard? The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that teaches that the stores are sold along with the courtyard, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the majority of their use is from within, </span>i.e., the stores are mainly accessed from within the courtyard, while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rabbi Ḥiyya, that teaches that the stores are not sold along with the courtyard, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the majority of their use is from without, </span>i.e., the stores are accessed mainly from the public domain.
The mishna teaches, and it was similarly taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a courtyard has sold only the airspace of the courtyard, </span>and he has sold nothing found in the courtyard, not even the houses. To clarify the disagreement between the unattributed opinion in the mishna and Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: If </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-italic">dirata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he means </span>to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">the houses </span>and that they are also included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him </span>that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-italic">darta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the courtyard. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he means </span>to sell only <span class="gemarra-regular">the garden, </span>i.e., the space between the houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the unattributed first opinion in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he means </span>to sell also <span class="gemarra-regular">the houses.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some state </span>a different version of this discussion, according to which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: If </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-italic">darta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, everyone agrees that he means </span>to sell also <span class="gemarra-regular">the houses </span>and that they are included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him </span>that he is selling him the <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Hebrew term for courtyard. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that when he says <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he means </span>to sell him only <span class="gemarra-regular">the airspace, </span>i.e., the open space of the courtyard itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the unattributed first opinion in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that houses are also included in the sale, just <span class="gemarra-regular">as the courtyard of the Tabernacle </span>included the Tabernacle itself.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">a sand field </span>for glass making, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a pon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for fishing or some other purpose, if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the sand fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in order to finalize the transaction, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired the pond </span>and must therefore perform a separate act of acquisition for it. Conversely, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he took possession of the pond, he has not acquired the sand field. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But doesn’t Shmuel say: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ten fields in ten </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">regions, </span>all in a single bill of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired them all;</span> and the two cases seem to be analogous.
The Gemara rejects the parallel: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the ten fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">the land is </span>all located in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>geographic <span class="gemarra-regular">block, and it all has one use, </span>i.e., to be farmed. The buyer, therefore, acquires all of the fields when he takes possession of one of them, even if they are not adjacent. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the sand field and the pond, <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the sand field, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a distinct use, </span>i.e., to supply sand for glass making, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the pond, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a distinct use, </span>i.e., for fishing. Therefore, taking possession of one of them does not effect a transfer of the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some state </span>a different version of the previous discussion. 

Daf 67b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>If one sold another a sand field and a pond, and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the sand field, he has </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the pond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, as Shmuel says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold ten fields to </span>another in ten different regions, once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired them all. The Gemara explains why Rav Naḥman’s statement was nevertheless necessary: It is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the ten fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">the land is </span>all located in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>geographic <span class="gemarra-regular">block </span>with a single use, and therefore all the fields are acquired together. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the sand field and the pond, <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the sand field, has <span class="gemarra-regular">a distinct use, and that, </span>the pond, has a <span class="gemarra-regular">distinct use, </span>and therefore taking possession of one of them should not effect acquisition of the other. Therefore, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that if the buyer took possession of the sand field, he has acquired the pond as well.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the terms used in the mishna. The <span class="gemarra-italic">yam</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">lentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the round stationary container into which the olives are placed before being crushed. As for the <span class="gemarra-italic">memel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabbi Abba bar Memel said: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-regular">crusher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the utensil used to pound and crush the olives.

The <span class="gemarra-italic">galgal</span> is the <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥumrata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a round stone that is placed on the beam to weigh it down. The <span class="gemarra-italic">kora</span> is the heavy wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>used to press down upon the olives and thereby extract the oil.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Learn from </span>the mishna that the legal status of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, as if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">should be sold along with the city. </span>Rav Ashi responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you claim, that the legal status of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property? </span>If that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the mishna’s statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if there were cattle and Canaanite slaves in the city, they are all sold? This is obvious, as the slaves should be treated no differently than the rest of the city’s movable property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say? </span>You must explain that there <span class="gemarra-regular">is a difference between movable property that moves about </span>by itself, such as slaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and movable property that does not move about </span>by itself, i.e., inanimate objects. In exactly the same manner, one can claim that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the legal status of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is a difference between land that moves about </span>by itself, i.e., slaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and land that does not move about </span>by itself.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a city has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sold </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">santar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">santar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">they interpreted </span>it to mean the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bar maḥavanita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in charge of keeping track of property boundaries. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Avtolemos </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that surround the city. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">santar</span> means the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar </span>understands that according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, when one sells a city, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the one who says </span>that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city holds that the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not sold </span>with the city.
The Gemara attempts to adduce proof in support of one of the opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna here that <span class="gemarra-regular">the olive presses and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hashelaḥin</span> are sold along with the city. The Sages initially <span class="gemarra-regular">maintained: What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This is referring to irrigated <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, </span>fields that require additional irrigation to supplement the rain that they receive. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: </span>“Who gives rain upon the earth <span class="gemarra-regular">and sends [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shole’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] water upon the fields” </span>(Job 5:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">santar</span> means the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar, the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>with the city, but the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar is not sold, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar is sold. But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">santar</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is saying as well. </span>In what way, then, does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagree with the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>?
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span> is irrigated <span class="gemarra-regular">fields? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">gardens </span>found within the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Your shoots [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥayikh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are an orchard of pomegranates” </span>(Song of Songs 4:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">But the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that surround the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sold. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fields are sold as well. </span>This is one version of the discussion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that the discussion took place as follows: The Sages initially <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">gardens </span>found within the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that <span class="it-text">santar</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the gardens </span>found within the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>along with the city, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sold, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the fields </span>that surround the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold. </span>

Daf 68b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">santar</span> means the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar, </span>is it reasonable that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">gardens </span>within the city are included in the sale of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel responded to him </span>that the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar </span>is included? How are the two connected? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">gardens? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-italic">shelaḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fields </span>that surround the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“Who gives rain upon the earth <span class="gemarra-regular">and sends [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sholeaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] waters upon the fields” </span>(Job 5:10). According to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, it is specifically the fields that are sold with the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar is not sold. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">registrar is also sold.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">santar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not sold </span>with the city, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the city scribe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ankolemus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is sold </span>with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the city scribe is a man </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">santar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also a man? </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are the cases comparable? This </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is, and that </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is, </span>and <span class="it-text">santar</span> means fields, and not the land registrar.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can you say </span>that according to Rabbi Yehuda the fields surrounding the city are not sold along with it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught in the latter clause </span>of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when one sells a city he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">its remnants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and not its daughters, </span>i.e., the nearby rural villages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not the woods that are set aside </span>and designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not the enclosures [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beivarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for animals, for birds, and for fish. And we said </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">its remnants? </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Bizlei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">bizlei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rabbi Abba said: The strips of the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are separated from the main fields by a stretch that cannot be cultivated. From here, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the strips of the fields that are not sold </span>with the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the fields themselves are sold </span>with it.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the statement found in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> so that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">santar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>now understood to mean fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">is sold </span>with the city, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">city scribe is not sold </span>with it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>to the point that you adduce proof from the words of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? As it is taught in the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when one sells a city he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sell <span class="gemarra-regular">its remnants, and </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sell <span class="gemarra-regular">its daughters, </span>i.e., the nearby rural villages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, doesn’t he say </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sold a city sold its daughters </span>along with it, i.e., the nearby rural villages, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a city has not sold its daughters; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a city has sold its daughters.</span>
The Gemara answers: This does not prove that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it may be suggested that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one </span>issue, that the fields that surround the city are included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">and disagrees with him with regard to </span>another issue, as according to Rabbi Yehuda the nearby villages are not sold along with the city.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: When one sells a city he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold, among other things, <span class="gemarra-regular">the enclosures for animals, for birds, and for fish. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">has daughters, </span>i.e., nearby villages, they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. If it has one part on the se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one part on dry land, </span>or if it has <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures for animals, for birds, or for fish, these are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the city.
The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as a distinction can be made between different cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the one <span class="it-text">baraita</span> addresses animal enclosures <span class="gemarra-regular">whose openings fac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inward, </span>i.e., toward the city, and they are therefore considered a part of the city, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> addresses animal enclosures <span class="gemarra-regular">whose openings face outward, </span>i.e., away from the city, and therefore they are not included in its sale. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: And </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the woods that are set aside for </span>the city, indicating that they face the city, and nevertheless they are not sold along with the city? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended so that it reads instead: And he has not sold the woods <span class="gemarra-regular">that are set apart </span>from the city, i.e., that are at a distance and do not face the city.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> without specifying what is included in the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold the stones </span>in the field <span class="gemarra-regular">that are for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the reeds in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that are for its use, and the produce that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached to the ground, and the cluster of reeds that </span>occupy <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the area required for sowing a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the watch station that is not plastered with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the young <span class="gemarra-regular">carob tree that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">been </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grafted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the untrimmed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sycamor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that is still young.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But he has not sold </span>along with the field <span class="gemarra-regular">the stones that are not </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for use </span>in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not the reeds in the vineyard that are not </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for its use, and not the produce that is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">detached from the ground. When </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything that is in it, all these </span>components <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold </span>along with the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Both </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where he executes the sale without specification, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where he adds the phrase that he is selling everything that is in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not sold the cluster of reeds that </span>occupy <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span> or more, as they are considered a separate field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the watch station that is plastered with clay, and not the carob tree that has been grafted, and not the sycamore trunk. </span>All of these entities are significant in their own right and have a status independent from that of the fields, and they are therefore not included in the sale of the field. 

Daf 69a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has sold the stones in the field that are for its use. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are for its use</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">they interpreted </span>it as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Stones </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sheave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in the field to protect them from being scattered by the wind. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>The mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are arranged for </span>the future building of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for the field. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are piled up for </span>the future building of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence, </span>and not necessarily arranged? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>that Rabbi Ḥiyya said: They are stones that are <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged </span>for the future building of a fence.
The Gemara elaborates on the two explanations: It was stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">they interpreted </span>the mishna as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones </span>that are placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sheaves. According to Rabbi Meir </span>this should be understood as referring to stones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are read</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to be used to protect the sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they are not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>on them. This is in keeping with Rabbi Meir’s opinion that whenever a place is sold, all the accompaniments that are necessary for its proper utilization are included in the sale (see 78b). <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, </span>the mishna is referring specifically to stones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on the sheaves.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Ulla, who says </span>that the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are arranged for </span>the future building of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence </span>for the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Meir, </span>stones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are ready </span>to be used for building a fence are also included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they are not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged </span>for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, </span>the mishna is referring specifically to stones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged </span>for building a fence.
The Gemara continues with its clarification of the mishna, which teaches that one who sells a field has <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the reeds in the vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that are for its use. </span>The Gemara asks: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">reeds, what is their purpose </span>in the vineyard? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yannai said: </span>These are <span class="gemarra-regular">reeds that are spli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on top and <span class="gemarra-regular">placed under the vines </span>so that the boughs of the vines can rest on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Meir, </span>this is referring to reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that have been smoothed </span>and made ready for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they are not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">set in their place. According to the Rabbis, </span>the mishna refers specifically to reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">set in their place.</span>
The Gemara continues expounding the mishna, which includes among the components that are sold with a field <span class="gemarra-regular">the produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached to the ground. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>for the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">to be cut down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is included in the sale since it is still attached to the ground. The mishna also includes among the things that are sold with a field <span class="gemarra-regular">the cluster of reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>occupy <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though </span>these reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">are thick, </span>they are still classified as part of the field.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field sells with it <span class="gemarra-regular">the watch statio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not plastered with clay. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though it is not fixed in the ground </span>and can still be moved, since it is not plastered, it is not significant enough to be considered an independent entity, and it is considered part of the field. The mishna also includes the following among the components that are sold with a field: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carob tree that has not been grafted, and the untrimmed sycamore. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though they are </span>big and <span class="gemarra-regular">thick, </span>since they have not yet reached the stage of grafting, in the case of the carob, or trimming, in the case of the sycamore, they are considered part of the field.
The Gemara proceeds to explain the second half of the mishna, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But he has not sold </span>along with the field <span class="gemarra-regular">the stones that are not </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for use </span>in the field. On the assumption that the mishna speaks of stones that are placed on the sheaves to prevent them from being scattered, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Meir, </span>the mishna is referring to stones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not ready </span>to be used for this purpose, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis, </span>even if the stones are ready to be used to protect the sheaves, they are not included in the sale if <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>on them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Ulla, who says </span>that the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones that are arranged for </span>the future building of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence </span>for the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Meir, </span>this clause addresses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the stones <span class="gemarra-regular">were not ready </span>to be used for this purpose, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis, </span>it addresses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the stones <span class="gemarra-regular">were not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged </span>for building a fence, even though they were ready to be used for that purpose.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the reeds in the vineyard that are not </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for its use. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Meir, </span>this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">are not smoothed, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis, </span>the reference is to reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">set in their place, </span>even if they are smoothed. The mishna further teaches: One who sells a field has also <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce that is detached from the ground. </span>The Gemara comments: The produce is not included in the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">requires the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that is, it needs to be left in the field in order to dry out completely.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the cluster of reeds that </span>occupy <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they are thin, </span>as since they occupy the area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">rova</span> they are considered a separate entity and are not part of the field. Concerning this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not only a cluster of reeds </span>that is considered a separate entity, and therefore not included in the sale; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, even a small garden bed of spice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that does not occupy the area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">rova</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but has a distinct name is not sold </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>What <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>means is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">call it the roses [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vardda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of so-and-so, </span>thereby establishing for it a name of its own.
The mishna teaches that the sale does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>include <span class="gemarra-regular">the watch station that is plastered with clay. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it is attached to the ground, </span>as it is still considered a separate entity and not part of the field. The mishna teaches: He has also <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the carob tree that has been grafted, and </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the sycamore trunk. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though they are small, </span>they are considered their own entity.
Apropos the discussion of a watch station that is attached to the ground, the Gemara cites a discussion about the sale of a house: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar raised the dilemma: </span>With regard to wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">door frames</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Are they sold together with the house, or not? The Gemara explains the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not raise the dilemma </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the frames <span class="gemarra-regular">are attached </span>to the house <span class="gemarra-regular">with clay, as they are </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the house and sold along with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">When you can raise this dilemma is where they are connected </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with small wooden pegs. What </span>is the ruling in that case? No resolution was found for this question, and so the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stand [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teiku</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises </span>a similar <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>about what is included in the sale of a house: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">window frames</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Are they sold together with the house, or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they serve merely </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">an ornament, </span>and are not included in the sale, and the seller can remove them from the house and keep them for himself? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, since they are attached </span>to the window, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are attached. </span>The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
And similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">stands for the legs of a be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that are placed under the legs to prevent them from being damaged by moisture, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not raise the dilemma wherever </span>the stands <span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the bed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they move </span>along with it and are therefore not considered part of the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where you can raise this dilemma is where they do not move </span>along with the bed. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the ruling in that case? No resolution was found for this question either, and therefore the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
The mishna teaches: One who sells a field has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the carob tree that has been grafted, and </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">the sycamore trunk. </span>

Daf 69b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>i.e., that a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk are not included in the sale of a field, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: As the verse states: “So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah,</span> which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was within it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the boundaries around, were established for Abraham as a possession” (Genesis 23:17–18). This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that requires a boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> around </span>it, as it does not have natural demarcations, is included in the sale of a field. This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes these </span>trees, i.e., the grafted carob and the sycamore trunk, <span class="gemarra-regular">which do not require a boundary around </span>them, as they stand out individually on their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya says: From here </span>there is a source <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the acquisition of the actual <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries </span>in a sale <span class="gemarra-regular">is from the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: One who sells land to anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must write for him </span>the following in the bill of sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire for yourself the palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the branches and the seedlings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And even if he did not write this for him </span>the buyer would still <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>all of these entities, as demonstrated by the mishna that it is only a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk that are excluded from the sale of a field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Even so, it is an enhancement of the bill </span>of sale that he write all of the details of the transaction so that there be no possible room for disagreement.
If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">the land and palm trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we consider </span>the situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he has palm trees, he must give him two palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> as two is the minimum number of trees that would justify being called: Trees, in the plural. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he has no </span>palm trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must buy two palm trees for him </span>somewhere else. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he has palm trees, but <span class="gemarra-regular">they are mortgaged </span>to another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must redeem</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two palm trees </span>and give them to the buyer.
If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">land with palm trees, we consider </span>the situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">If there are palm trees on </span>the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must give him </span>the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mistaken transactio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and the sale is void. If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">land of palm trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>claim to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees. </span>Therefore, if the land has no palm trees, this is not a mistaken transaction, as the seller meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>that the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit for palm trees, </span>and not that it already contained them. Furthermore, if the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer that he is selling the land <span class="gemarra-regular">except for such and such a palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we consider </span>the situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is a good palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> we assume that <span class="gemarra-regular">he retained </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> one for himself and did not include it in the sale, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is a bad palm tree, </span>we assume that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>did he retain for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>ones that are of higher quality.
If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer that he is selling him the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the trees, </span>we consider the situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he has </span>different types of <span class="gemarra-regular">trees</span> in the field, for example, olive and fig trees, he has sold the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the trees. If he has </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees </span>in the field, we assume that he meant to sell the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the palm trees, </span>even though one does not ordinarily refer to palm trees by the more general term: Trees. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he has </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevines </span>in the field, the buyer acquires everything <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the grapevines.</span>
If the field has both <span class="gemarra-regular">trees and grapevines, </span>he has sold everything <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> therefore, the buyer does not acquire the trees, which the seller excluded from the sale, but he does acquire the grapevines. Similarly, if in the field there are both <span class="gemarra-regular">trees and palm trees, </span>he has sold everything <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If there are no other trees in the field, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevines and palm trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> everything, including the palm trees, is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the grapevines, </span>which we assume the seller reserved for himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>If the seller specified that he is selling a field but not the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>tree that is so tall <span class="gemarra-regular">that one must climb it by rope </span>in order to harvest its fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">is retained </span>and is not included in the sale, and <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">that one need not climb by rope is not retained </span>and is sold along with the field. 

Daf 70a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But the judges of the exile, </span>Shmuel and Karna, <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Any </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">that is bent </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">by the yoke </span>of oxen as the animals plow the ground under the tree, and in this way the tree does not impede the plowing, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not retained </span>by the seller, as it is not a significant tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not bent </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">by the yoke </span>of the oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">is retained </span>by the seller and not included in the sale. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which Rav said, that the only trees that the seller retains for himself and excludes from the sale are those that must be climbed by means of a rope, was said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to palm trees, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which the judges of the exile said, that the only trees that are retained are those that are not bent back by the yoke of the oxen, was said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>other types of <span class="gemarra-regular">trees.</span>
§ The Gemara cites a discussion related to the mishna’s ruling that a grafted carob tree and a sycamore trunk are not included in the sale of the field: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: </span>If one selling a field said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for such and such </span>grafted <span class="gemarra-regular">carob tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for such and such </span>sycamore <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, </span>and there were other grafted carob trees or sycamore trunks in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Does the seller mean to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is this carob tree that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire, but he does acquire the other carob trees, or perhaps </span>he means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he also does not acquire the rest of the carob trees? </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: The buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>any of them.
Rav Aḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rav Sheshet from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states: If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you this field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for such and such carob tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for such and such </span>sycamore <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, </span>the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is this carob tree that he does not acquire, but he does acquire the other carob trees?</span>
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>what this means is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not acquire even the other carob trees. Know </span>that this is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>a person selling a field <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">My field is sold to you except for such and such fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that is adjacent to it, would you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>adjacent field <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not acquire, but he acquires </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>fields owned by the seller? This is clearly not the case, as the seller explicitly stated that he is selling a certain field, not all of his fields. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>everyone would agree that the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the other fields. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the other carob trees.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the discussion took place as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: </span>If one selling a field said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for half of such and such carob tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for half of such and such </span>sycamore <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Do we say that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly does not acquire the other carob trees, but he does acquire what remains from that carob tree </span>that was mentioned, that is, the half of the carob tree that the seller did not specifically retain for himself? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he does not acquire even what remains from that carob tree? </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Even what remains from that carob tree the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire.</span>
Rav Aḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rav Sheshet from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states: If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <span class="gemarra-regular">except for half of such and such carob tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for half of such and such </span>sycamore <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, </span>the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire the other carob trees. What, is it not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the other carob trees that he does not acquire, but what remains of that carob tree he does acquire?</span>
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>what this means is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not acquire even what remains of that carob tree. Know </span>that this is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>a person selling a field <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">My field is sold to you except for half of such and such field </span>that is adjacent to it, would you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>half of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not acquire, but he acquires the other </span>half of the field? This is clearly not the case, as the seller explicitly stated that he is selling a certain field and nothing else. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>everyone would agree that the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the other half of the field. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>what remains of the carob tree.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram raised a dilemm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Ḥisda: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">deposits </span>certain items <span class="gemarra-regular">with another </span>and receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a documen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> signed by witnesses testifying that he deposited these items with this individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the bailee later <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: I returned </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>but the document is still in the hands of the depositor, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say that since if </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to </span>lie <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the items <span class="gemarra-regular">were taken </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">under circumstances beyond his control</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have been deemed credible; </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, </span>when he claims that he returned the items, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is deemed credible as well? Or perhaps, </span>the one who deposited the items can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>If you returned the items, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is your document doing in my possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Upon return of the deposit, you should have retrieved the document. Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed credible.</span>
Rav Amram asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>the depositor <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the bailee: If you returned the items, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is your document doing in my possession? </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And according to your reasoning, if </span>the bailee had <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the items <span class="gemarra-regular">were taken </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">under circumstances beyond his control, would he be able to say to him: What is your document doing in my possession? </span>Since this claim could not have been stated had the bailee stated the alternative claim, it can also not be stated when the bailee claims that the items were returned. Rav Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 70b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the depositor that the items were <span class="gemarra-regular">taken </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">under circumstances beyond his control, is he not required to take an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> How, then, can you assert that he is deemed credible to claim that he returned the items without taking an oath? Rav Ḥisda said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, what </span>did I mean when I said that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible? </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is deemed credible when </span>he takes <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that Rav Amram and Rav Ḥisda disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purse document</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a document that records an arrangement whereby one gives another money as an investment in a joint venture on condition that the profits will be divided equally between the two parties. If the person who received the money died, and this document <span class="gemarra-regular">was presented </span>by the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">against the orphans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the judges of the exile say </span>that the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath </span>that the money had never been returned to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the entire </span>sum. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the judges of Eretz Yisrae</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath and collects </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> of the sum.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is understood <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees with </span>the opinion of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a, as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this joint venture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereby one person gives money to another on condition that it will be used for business purposes and that the profits will be divided equally between the two parties, <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the invested money is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan, </span>for which the borrower is exclusively liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposit, </span>so that if it is lost under circumstances beyond his control, the borrower is exempt from the liability to return it.
According to this assumption, everyone agrees that the claimant can recover from the orphans by means of an oath the half of the money that is considered a loan, just as he would have been able to demand that money from their father. Concerning the half that is considered a deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">what, is it not with regard to this </span>point that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the judges of the exile, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>like Rav Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the depositor <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is your document doing in my possession? </span>Therefore, neither the father nor his children are deemed credible to claim that they had returned the half that is considered a deposit, and the investor can collect that half as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>like Rav Ḥisda, that one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot assert </span>this claim, and therefore the investor can collect only the half that is considered a loan. But as for the half that is considered a deposit, the father would have been deemed credible in his claim that he had already returned it.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone, </span>i.e., both the judges of the exile and the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>that the father can claim that he returned the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, they disagree about </span>the following issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the judges of the exile, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is so </span>that he had in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have tol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> his children that he repaid it. Since he did not tell them, it may be assumed that he never repaid the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was the Angel of Deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that prevented him </span>from doing so, meaning he died before he had the opportunity to give his children a detailed report concerning his financial affairs.
Apropos this discussion, it is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Avin sent </span>the following ruling: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">deposits </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with another </span>and receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a document </span>attesting to the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the bailee later <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: I returned </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>the bailee is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible </span>even if the document is still in the hands of the depositor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a purse document </span>attesting to a joint venture <span class="gemarra-regular">that was presented </span>by the lender to support his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">against the </span>borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans, </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath </span>that the money had never been returned to him <span class="gemarra-regular">and collects the entire </span>sum from the orphans.
The Gemara asks: Don’t these <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> contradict each other? If the father is deemed credible when he claims that he repaid a loan, the court should present this claim on behalf of his orphans. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, as if it is so </span>that the father had, in fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have told </span>his children that he repaid it. Since he did not tell them anything about it, it may be assumed that he never repaid the money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to the case of a purse document that was presented to support a claim against orphans, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath </span>that the money had never been returned to him <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">collects hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> of the sum recorded in the document, in accordance with the judges of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara relates that two generations later, <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the judges of the exile. Ravina said to Mar Zutra: Didn’t Rava say </span>that the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath and collects half </span>of the sum? Mar Zutra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>With regard to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the judges of the exile, we</span>

Daf 71a

<span class="gemarra-regular">learned the reverse, </span>that is to say, according to our version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is the judges of the exile who maintain that the claimant collects only half the sum, which corresponds to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Rava.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In continuation of the previous mishna (68b) discussing one who sells a field, the mishna teaches that even if he says that he is selling it and everything that is in it, has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the winepress, nor the dovecote, whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">abandoned or utilized, </span>as these items are not part of the field itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must purchase </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a path </span>through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva, </span>who holds that one who sells, sells generously; therefore, whatever is not explicitly excluded from the sale is assumed to be sold, and it is presumed that the seller did not retain for himself the right to the path that he requires to access his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not </span>purchase a path through the buyer’s domain, as it is assumed that since the seller withholds these items for himself, he also reserves a path to reach them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling the field <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from these </span>things, i.e., the cistern and the winepress, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain. Since these items would have been excluded from the sale even if he had said nothing, it is assumed that he also meant to reserve for himself the right to access them. But if the seller kept the field but <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the cistern and winepress <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought, since a seller sells generously. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path </span>through the seller’s domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that these items are excluded, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who sells </span>a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to one who gives </span>it away as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives all of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> including everything found in the field. Similarly, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> their father’s estate among themselves, when they each <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">field </span>as part of their inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">they acquire all of it, </span>including the items that would be excluded from a sale. So too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes possession of the property of a convert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes possession of a field, he takes possession of all of it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who consecrates a field has consecrated all of it. Rabbi Shimon says: One who consecrates a field has not consecrated </span>any of the items that are ordinarily excluded from a sale <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the grafted carob tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the sycamore trunk.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sale different from </span>a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is a gift different from </span>a sale? Why does the mishna distinguish between the two with regard to what is retained by the prior owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda ben Nekosa explained before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: The difference between the cases is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">specified </span>that certain items were not included in the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the donor, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not specify.</span>
The Gemara asks: How can it be suggested that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">specified and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">did not specify, </span>when in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">did not specify, and that one did not specify, </span>as in neither case did the prior owner specify what items he was reserving for himself? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">should have specifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that those items that are not integral parts of the field are nevertheless included in the sale, and since he neglected to do so, he suffers the loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have specified </span>what was included in the gift, as it would have been inappropriate for him to act in this manner.
It is related that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>others: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give to so-and-so </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">house containing 100 barrels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gulfei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> as a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was found that there was </span>a house in his possession that <span class="gemarra-regular">contained 120 </span>barrels. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that he was giving him a house containing <span class="gemarra-regular">100 </span>barrels, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him </span>that he was giving him a house containing <span class="gemarra-regular">120 </span>barrels. Therefore, the recipient receives only the portion of the house that holds 100 barrels, and not the rest of the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna here: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who sells </span>a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to one who gives </span>it away as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift, </span>it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives all of it. Apparently, one who gives a gif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gives generously. Here too, </span>then, say that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives a gift gives generously, </span>even if he is not always precise in his wording. Therefore, it should be assumed that the donor intended to give the recipient the entire house, which contains more than 100 barrels.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who consecrates a field, has consecrated </span>all of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Even though the Rabbis said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one buys two trees in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not acquire </span>any of <span class="gemarra-regular">the land </span>but acquires only the trees, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells land </span>to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">retains two trees for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">retains the lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> around those trees, that does not always apply. Rav Huna elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously </span>and does not retain anything for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">this does not always apply, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a pit and a cistern, which do not weaken the land, </span>and therefore the seller feels no need to protect himself from the potential claims of the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">trees, which do weaken the land, </span>as they draw water and nutrients from the soil, 

Daf 71b

<span class="gemarra-regular">if it is so that </span>the prior owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not retain </span>some of the land for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Uproo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your trees, take </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and go, </span>as the trees draw water and nutrients from the soil, causing damage to the buyer’s land. Therefore, the seller must have retained for himself the land needed for these trees.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna here that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: One who consecrates a field has not consecrated </span>any of the items that are ordinarily excluded from a sale <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the grafted carob tree and the sycamore trunk. And it is taught with regard to </span>this in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason </span>that it is specifically the carob tree and the sycamore trunk that are consecrated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">nutrients from a consecrated field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner must have had in mind to consecrate them as well, as otherwise his trees would be nurtured from consecrated property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind, </span>as Rav Huna claims, that when the seller retains certain trees for himself, he also <span class="gemarra-regular">retains </span>the land around them so that they will be nurtured from soil that belongs to him, what is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>these trees <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">nutrients, they draw </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">nutrients from </span>the ground that the consecrator had retained for himself that still <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to him, </span>not from consecrated property.
The Gemara answers: The assumption that Rav Huna’s statement is true according to everyone must be reconsidered. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says </span>that one who consecrates his field does not retain for himself the land around the trees, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of his teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to Rabbi Akiva, one who sells, sells generously, and there is no presumption that he retained some item or right for himself unless this was stated explicitly. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon rules that one who consecrates his field has also consecrated the carob trees, as otherwise they would draw nutrients from consecrated land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna, who says </span>that when a seller retains trees for himself he also retains the land around them, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who say that one who sells, sells sparingly.
The Gemara asks: If Rav Huna’s statement is only <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>then isn’t his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> What novel idea is he adding? The Gemara answers: The practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>while one might have thought that the prior owner retains a right to the land only for the sake of trees that were there, this is not the case. Rather, he retains absolute ownership of the land, and therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>or die <span class="gemarra-regular">he can plant them again</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 72a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But can you establish that </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>that one who sells or consecrates property does so generously? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one consecrates three tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in a field <span class="gemarra-regular">where ten </span>trees are <span class="gemarra-regular">planted in an area required for sowing one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has consecrated </span>not only those trees, but also <span class="gemarra-regular">the land and the </span>young <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between them? Therefore, </span>if this is an ancestral field of his, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he redeems </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeems </span>the land and everything contained within it according to the standard rate established by the Torah, whereby <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sowing of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥomer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a <span class="it-text">kor</span>, of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley see</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> is redeemed <span class="gemarra-regular">for fifty silver shekels.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If the ratio of land to trees was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the trees were planted more densely, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the ratio of land to trees was <span class="gemarra-regular">more than this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the trees were planted less densely, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if he consecrated </span>each of the trees separately, <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">has consecrated neither the land nor the </span>young <span class="gemarra-regular">trees between them. Therefore, when he redeems </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeems the trees in accordance with their worth. And moreover, even if one consecrates the trees </span>where they are planted more densely, less densely, or one after the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrates the land, </span>so that everything belongs to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he redeems </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeems the trees </span>separately <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with their worth, and then he redeems </span>the land according to the standard rate, where <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sowing of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥomer</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley seed </span>is redeemed <span class="gemarra-regular">for fifty silver shekels.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and all the more so one who consecrates </span>does so generously? This being the case, even if the trees were consecrated one after the other, some of the land should be consecrated along with them. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, don’t they say </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller who sells sparingly, but one who consecrates, consecrates generously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the pit and the winepress are consecrated along with the field? Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated here is not in accordance with their opinion either. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in the mishna here, that even one who consecrates a field does not consecrate the cistern and the winepress along with it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of whom? If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously, and all the more so one who consecrates </span>does so generously? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that his opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and say that one who sells, sells sparingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon </span>disagrees with the Rabbis insofar as <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as one who sells, sells sparingly, one who consecrates also consecrates sparingly and retains the land </span>around the trees for himself. 

Daf 72b

The Gemara concludes stating the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as Rabbi Shimon himself said that the grafted carob tree and the sycamore trunk are consecrated along with the field <span class="gemarra-regular">since they draw </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">nutrients from a consecrated field, </span>indicating that one who consecrates acts generously and does not retain the land around the trees for himself.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be understood that when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>stated his ruling in the mishna, he was not expressing his own opinion. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he meant to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as one who sells, sells sparingly, so too, one who consecrates, consecrates sparingly and retains </span>for himself land to nurture the trees. Therefore, when one consecrates a field, even the sycamore and carob tree are not consecrated along with it. But <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your </span>opinion, that one who consecrates does so generously, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at least that </span>one who consecrates a field <span class="gemarra-regular">has consecrated only the grafted carob and the sycamore trunk, </span>because they draw nutrients from consecrated ground, but he has not consecrated the other items that are not integral parts of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis said to him: There is no differenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> between the two in this regard. Since one who consecrates an item does so generously, everything found in the field is consecrated.
The Gemara returns to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it had concluded was taught according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which opinion did you interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discussing consecrated property? It was interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the last clause: And moreover, even if one consecrates the trees and then </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrates the land, when he redeems </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeems the trees </span>separately <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with their worth, and then he redeems </span>the land according to the standard rate, where <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sowing of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥomer</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley seed </span>is redeemed <span class="gemarra-regular">for fifty silver shekels.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, let him follow </span>the character of the field at the time of its <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption, and </span>so the trees should <span class="gemarra-regular">be redeemed along with their land, </span>as at the time of the redemption both the trees and the land are consecrated. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that Rabbi Shimon follows </span>the time of the redemption, i.e., he determines the price at which a field is redeemed based on the time it is being redeemed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who purchases a field from his father and consecrates it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and afterward his father dies, </span>so the field would now be considered his as an inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>with regard to its redemption <span class="gemarra-regular">it should be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">before him as an ancestral fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and not a field that he purchased? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>about a field that was purchased: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if </span>he sanctifies to the Lord <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields” </span>(Leviticus 27:22). The verse speaks specifically of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that is not fit </span>at the time of its consecration <span class="gemarra-regular">to be an ancestral field, </span>meaning that he never could have inherited it in the future. This specification <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes this </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">that was fit to be an ancestral field </span>from this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, since eventually it would have become his through inheritance, even had he not purchased it. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>learns a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from this verse, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field from his father, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his father dies, and afterward he consecrates </span>the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that it should be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">before him like an ancestral field? The verse states: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he sanctifies to the Lord <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields.” </span>The verse refers specifically to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that is not </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">an ancestral field </span>at the time of its consecration. This specification <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes this </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>after the death of the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an ancestral field.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, a verse is not required </span>to teach that, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his father dies and afterward he consecrates </span>the field, it is considered to be an ancestral field, as this is obvious. <span class="gemarra-regular">A verse is required </span>only to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he consecrates </span>the field after having bought it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward his father dies.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon arrive at this conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>they derive it only <span class="gemarra-regular">from this verse, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to be interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as opposed to the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, as there is no clear proof from the verse to support either opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they follow </span>the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption, </span>and at the time of the redemption the father is dead, and the field is the son’s ancestral field that is currently in the possession of the Temple treasury?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: Actually, </span>I can say to you that <span class="gemarra-regular">generally </span>speaking, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon do not follow </span>the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption, </span>and therefore their ruling here is not based on this premise. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here they found a verse and interpreted it, </span>as, if the verse is to be understood as it was explained by Rabbi Meir, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse write: And if </span>he sanctifies to the Lord <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral estate, or </span>let it write: Which is not <span class="gemarra-regular">his ancestral field. What </span>is meant by the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Which is not of his ancestral fields” </span>(Leviticus 27:22)? It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that is not fit to </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">be an ancestral field </span>is considered a purchased field. That <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes this </span>field, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is fit to be an ancestral field. </span>Based on this explanation, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that addresses one who consecrates trees can, in fact, be understood to be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: A grafted carob and a sycamore trunk have </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the status of a tree and the status of land. </span>Each of these <span class="gemarra-regular">has the status of a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so if one consecrates or buys two trees and this </span>carob or sycamore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>also consecrated or bought <span class="gemarra-regular">the land </span>between them, as the sycamore or carob joins with the other two trees to form a unit of three trees that take their land with them. And each <span class="gemarra-regular">has the status of land, as it is not sold along with land, </span>as explained in the mishna, that one who sells a field has not sold a grafted carob or a sycamore trunk that is in the field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna says </span>in a similar fashion: A large <span class="gemarra-regular">sheaf </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">that contains two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the status of a sheaf and the status of a heap </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of forgotten sheaves that must be left for the poor. <span class="gemarra-regular">It has the status of a sheaf, as </span>the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">two sheaves </span>that were inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">left in the field are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>sheaves that must be left for the poor, whereas three sheaves need not be left for the poor, but rather the owner of the field may go back and take them for himself. In this regard a two-se’a sheaf is considered one sheaf, so if one forgot <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sheaves <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>sheave that contains two <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, the three together are three sheaves and <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>sheaves that must be left for the poor.
And <span class="gemarra-regular">it has the status of a heap, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 6:6): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheaf that contains two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">one forgets it </span>in a field, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a forgotten </span>sheaf that must be left for the poor, as its size and importance grant it the status of a heap, rather than a sheaf.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>With regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk </span>are consecrated along with a field that one has consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at the dispute between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei and the Rabbis, </span>as Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei rules that they are not consecrated, whereas the Rabbis rule that they are. 

Daf 73a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the disput</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis, </span>as it was concluded previously that according to Rabbi Shimon himself, even the carob and sycamore trees are not consecrated. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>and therefore Rabbi Shimon is not the only Sage who holds this opinion.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sells a shi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has sold </span>along with it <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">toren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ogin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and all </span>of the equipment that is used for <span class="gemarra-regular">directing it. But he has not sold the slaves </span>who serve as oarsmen, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the packing bags </span>that are used for transporting goods, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">antikei</span> on the ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when one said to </span>the buyer: You are purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>the ship, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all that it contains, all of these </span>latter elements <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">sold.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <span class="gemarra-italic">toren</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">mast [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iskarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this regard <span class="gemarra-regular">it states: “They have taken </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cedar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from Lebanon to make masts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">toren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for you”</span> (Ezekiel 27:5). The <span class="gemarra-italic">nes</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">sail, and </span>in this regard <span class="gemarra-regular">it states: “Of fine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with richly woven work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you for an ensign [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Ezekiel 27:7). With regard to the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">ogin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: These are </span>the ship’s <span class="gemarra-regular">anchors, and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">it states: “Would you tarry for them until they were grown? Would you shut yourselves off for them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">te’agena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and have no husbands?” </span>(Ruth 1:13). This demonstrates that the root <span class="it-text">ayin</span>, <span class="it-text">gimmel</span>, <span class="it-text">nun</span>, means being shut up and held firmly in one place.
The mishna teaches that the buyer acquires all the equipment used for <span class="gemarra-regular">directing </span>the ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba says: These are the </span>ship’s <span class="gemarra-regular">oars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>this is as <span class="gemarra-regular">it states: “Of the oaks of Bashan they have made your oars” </span>(Ezekiel 27:6). Since a verse discussing ships focuses on its oars, evidently the oars are an integral part of the ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that it is demonstrated <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “And all that handle the oar, </span>the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall come down from their ships” </span>(Ezekiel 27:29).
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One who sells a ship has </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the gangway [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iskala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> used for boarding the ship, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the water tank it contains</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: One who sells a ship has sold the </span>ship’s <span class="gemarra-regular">boat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bitzit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which is used as a lifeboat or for fishing in shallow waters. <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos says: One who sells a ship has sold the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dugit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as explained below.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">bitzit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the same as the <span class="gemarra-italic">dugit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Natan was a Babylonian, </span>and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he called </span>small boats <span class="gemarra-italic">butzit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as people say: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">botziata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>small boats, <span class="gemarra-regular">of Miashan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sumakhos, who was from Eretz Yisrael, called </span>these boats <span class="gemarra-italic">dugit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is written: </span>“You shall be taken away with hooks, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your residue in fishing boats [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">duga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Amos 4:2).
§ The Gemara cites several incidents that involve ships and the conversation of seafarers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Seafarers related to m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that when <span class="gemarra-regular">this wave that sinks a shi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appears with a ray of white fire at its head, we strike it with clubs that are inscribed </span>with the names of God: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am that I am, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the Lord of Hosts, amen amen, Selah. And </span>the wave then <span class="gemarra-regular">abates.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Seafarers related to me </span>that in a certain place <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">wave and </span>the next <span class="gemarra-regular">wav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> there are <span class="gemarra-regular">three hundred parasangs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the height of a wave is three hundred parasangs. Once, </span>seafarers recounted, <span class="gemarra-regular">we were traveling along the route and a wave lifted us up until we saw the resting place of a small star, and it </span>appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>the size of the area needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">scattering forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of mustard seeds. And if it had lifted us higher, we would have been scorched by the heat </span>of the star.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the wave raised its voice </span>and shouted <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>wave: <span class="gemarra-regular">My friend, did you leave anything in the world that you did not wash away, that I may come and destroy it? </span>The second wave <span class="gemarra-regular">said to it: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see the greatness of your Master, </span>God, as even when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as a string of sand </span>on the land <span class="gemarra-regular">I cannot pass, as it is stated: “Will you not fear Me, said the Lord; will you not tremble at My presence? Who has placed the sand for the bound of the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass?” </span>(Jeremiah 5:22).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: I have seen </span>the one called <span class="gemarra-regular">Hurmin, son of Lilith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when he was running on the pinnacles of the wall of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoza, and a horseman was riding an animal below him but was unable </span>to catch up to <span class="gemarra-regular">him. Once, they saddled for him two mules and they stood</span>

Daf 73b

<span class="gemarra-regular">on the two bridges of </span>the river <span class="gemarra-regular">Rognag, and he jumped from this one to that one, and from that one to this one. And he was holding two cups of wine in his hands and was pouring from this one to that one, and from that one to this one, and not </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">drop fell to the ground. And that day was</span> stormy, similar to the description in a verse dealing with seafarers: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They mounted up to the heavens, they went down to the deeps; </span>their soul melted away because of trouble” (Psalms 107:26). He continued in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>word of his behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">was heard in the house of the king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they killed him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: I have seen a day-old antelope [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">urzila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was </span>as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as Mount Tabor. And how </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">is Mount Tabor? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">four parasangs. And the length of its neck </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">three parasangs, and the place where his head rests </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">a parasang and a half. It cast feces [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kufta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">dammed up the Jordan.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I have seen a certain frog [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akrokta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was </span>as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as the fort [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Hagronya. And how </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">is the fort of Hagronya? </span>It is as large as <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty houses. A snake came and swallowed </span>the frog. <span class="gemarra-regular">A raven came and swallowed the snake, and </span>flew <span class="gemarra-regular">up and sat in a tree. Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see how great is the strength of the tree, </span>which could bear the weight of that raven. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said: If I had not been there </span>and seen this, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not believe </span>it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain fish in</span> whose <span class="gemarra-regular">nostril [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">b</span><span class="gemarra-italic">e</span><span class="gemarra-italic CharOverride-1">’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">u</span><span class="gemarra-italic">syeih</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mud eater [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhla</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a type of insect, <span class="gemarra-regular">had sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and killed him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the waters thrust </span>the fish <span class="gemarra-regular">and threw it upon the shore. And sixty districts were destroyed by </span>the fish, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sixty districts ate from it, and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty districts salted its </span>meat to preserve it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they filled from one of its eyeballs three hundred flasks of oil. And when we returned </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the year </span>had passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">we saw that they were cutting beams from its bones, and they had set out to build those districts </span>that had been destroyed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish upon which sand had settled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and grass grew on it. We assumed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was dry land and went up and baked and cooked on the back </span>of the fish, <span class="gemarra-regular">but when its back </span>grew <span class="gemarra-regular">hot it turned over. And were it not for </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ship was close </span>by, <span class="gemarra-regular">we would have drowned.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and the ship traveled between </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">fin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a fish </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">three days and three nights. </span>The fish was swimming in the opposite direction of the ship, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>was swimming <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>against the wind and the waves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we were </span>sailing <span class="gemarra-regular">downward. And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ship did not travel very fast, when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>In the short amount of time required to <span class="gemarra-regular">heat a kettle of water, </span>that ship can <span class="gemarra-regular">travel sixty parasangs. And </span>another demonstration of its speed is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a horseman shot an arrow, and </span>yet the ship was traveling so swiftly that it <span class="gemarra-regular">outraced it. And Rav Ashi said: That </span>fish <span class="gemarra-regular">was a sea </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gildana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which has two </span>sets of <span class="gemarra-regular">fins.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain bir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was standing with water up to its ankles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kartzuleih</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and its head </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sky. And we said </span>to ourselves that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>deep <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>here, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we wanted to go down to cool ourselves off. And a Divine Voic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emerged and said to us: Do not go down here, as the ax of a carpenter fell </span>into it <span class="gemarra-regular">seven years </span>ago <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it has still <span class="gemarra-regular">not reached the bottom. And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not because the water is so large </span>and deep. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the water is turbulent. Rav Ashi said: And that </span>bird <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>called <span class="gemarra-italic">ziz</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sadai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>wild beast, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“I know all the fowls of the mountains; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ziz</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sadai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is Mine” </span>(Psalms 50:11).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we saw these geese whose wings were sloping because they were so fat, and streams of oil flowed beneath them. I said to them: Shall we have a portion of you in the World-to-Come? One raised a wing, and one raised a leg, </span>signaling an affirmative response. <span class="gemarra-regular">When I came before Rabbi Elazar, he said to me: The Jewish people will </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">be held accountable for </span>the suffering <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the geese. Since the Jews do not repent, the geese are forced to continue to grow fat as they wait to be given to the Jewish people as a reward.
§ The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> for the items shown by an Arab man to Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the following stories: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the dust of the sky-blue; the scorpion stung the basket.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we were accompanied by a certain Arab who would take dust and smell it and say: This is the road to such and such a place, and that is the road to such and such a place. We said to him: How far are we from water? And he said to us: Bring me dust. We brought </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, and he said: Eight parasangs. </span>Later, we said this <span class="gemarra-regular">a second time, and gave him </span>dust, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to us that we are at a distance of three parasangs.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I switched </span>the type of dust to test him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I could not </span>confuse <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>as he was an expert in this matter.
That Arab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Come, I will show you the dead of the wilderness, </span>i.e., the Jewish people who left Egypt and died in the wilderness. <span class="gemarra-regular">I went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw them; and they had the appearance of one who is intoxicated, </span>

Daf 74a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and they were lying on their backs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And the knee of one of them was elevated, and </span>he was so enormous that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Arab entered under his kne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while riding a camel and with his spear upright, and he did not touch him. I cut one corner of the sky-blue </span>garment that contains ritual fringes <span class="gemarra-regular">of one of them, and we were unable to walk. </span>The Arab <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Perhaps you took something from them? Return it, as we know </span>by tradition <span class="gemarra-regular">that one who takes something from them cannot walk. I then returned </span>the corner of the garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then we were able to walk.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When I came before the Sages, they said to me </span>in rebuke: <span class="gemarra-regular">Every Abb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an idiot. For </span>the purpose of clarifying <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did you do that? </span>If you wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to know whether </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai or in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>as to whether there are four or three threads and joints in ritual fringes, in that case there was no need to take anything with you, as <span class="gemarra-regular">you should have </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">counted the thread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and counted the joints</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. That Arab also <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Come, I will show you Mount Sinai. I went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that scorpions were encircling it, and they were standing </span>as high <span class="gemarra-regular">as white donkeys. I heard a Divine Voice saying: Woe is Me that I took an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and now that I took the oath, who will nullify it for me?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When I came before the Sages, they said to me </span>in rebuke: <span class="gemarra-regular">Every Abba </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an idiot. You should have said: Your </span>oath <span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabba bar bar Ḥana did not nullify the oath because <span class="gemarra-regular">he reasoned: Perhaps </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">oath that </span>He will not <span class="gemarra-regular">flood </span>the earth again. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Sages </span>would argue that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>that were <span class="gemarra-regular">so, why </span>say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe is Me? </span>Rather, this must be referring to God’s oath of exile upon the Jewish people.
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. The Arab also <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Come, I will show you those who were swallowed </span>by the earth due to the sin <span class="gemarra-regular">of Korah. I saw two rifts </span>in the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">that were issuing smoke. </span>The Arab <span class="gemarra-regular">took a shearing of wool, and dipped it in water, and inserted it on the head of a spear, and placed it </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">there. And when he removed </span>the wool, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was scorched. He said to me: Listen </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">what you hear; and I heard that they were saying: Moses and his Torah are true</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they, </span>i.e., we in the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">are liars. </span>The Arab further <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Every thirty days Gehenna returns them to here, like meat in a pot </span>that is moved around by the boiling water as it cooks. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>every time <span class="gemarra-regular">they say this: Moses and his Torah are true, and they, </span>i.e., we in the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">are liars.</span>
This Arab also <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Come, I will show you </span>the place <span class="gemarra-regular">where the earth and the heavens touch each other. I took my basket </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">placed it in a window of the heavens. After I </span>finished <span class="gemarra-regular">praying, I searched for it but did not find it. I said to him: Are there thieves here? He said to me: This is the heavenly sphere that is turning around; wait here until tomorrow and you will find it.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out of the sea, and its eyes had the appearance of two moons, and water scattered from its two gills like the two rivers of Sura. Rav Safra relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its head out of the sea, and it had horns, and </span>the following was <span class="gemarra-regular">inscribed on them: I am a lowly creature of the sea and I am three hundred parasangs </span>long, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am going into the mouth of the leviathan. Rav Ashi said: That is the goat of the sea, which searches </span>through the sea <span class="gemarra-regular">and has horns.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain crate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kartalita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in which precious stones and pearls were set, and a species of fish called sharks encircled it. </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">descended, </span>

Daf 74b

i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">a diver [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bar</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">amoraei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> went into the water <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring </span>up this chest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the fish <span class="gemarra-regular">became angry and sought to sever his thigh, but </span>the diver <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>upon it <span class="gemarra-regular">a flask of vinegar and they descended </span>and swam away. <span class="gemarra-regular">A Divine Voice emerged </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to us: What </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">do you have to </span>touch <span class="gemarra-regular">the crate of the wife of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as she is destined to insert sky-blue </span>wool <span class="gemarra-regular">in i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>be used in the ritual fringes of <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous in the World-to-Come?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda from India relates: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain precious ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was encircled by a snake. A diver descended to bring it </span>up, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">snake came and sought to swallow the ship. A raven came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cut off its head, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the water turned into blood </span>due to the enormousness of the snake. <span class="gemarra-regular">Another snake came, took </span>the precious stone, <span class="gemarra-regular">and hung it </span>on the dead snake, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it recovered. It returned </span>and again <span class="gemarra-regular">sought to swallow the ship, </span>and yet again <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird came and cut off its head, took that precious stone, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">threw it onto the ship. We had with us these salted birds; we placed </span>the stone <span class="gemarra-regular">on them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they took </span>the stone <span class="gemarra-regular">and flew away with it.</span>
§ Apropos the stories of large sea creatures, the Gemara discusses the large sea creatures mentioned in the Bible. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, who were traveling on a ship, and Rabbi Eliezer was sleeping and Rabbi Yehoshua was awake. Rabbi Yehoshua trembled, and Rabbi Eliezer awoke.</span> Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is this, Yehoshua; for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did you tremble? </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I saw a great light in the sea. </span>Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perhaps you saw the eyes of the leviathan, as it is written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning” </span>(Job 41:10).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me: Once we were traveling in the desert, and we had a thigh of meat with us. We cut open </span>the thigh <span class="gemarra-regular">and tore </span>off the sciatic nerve and the forbidden fat <span class="gemarra-regular">and put it on the grass. By </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">that we brought wood, the thigh had repaired </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we roasted it. When we returned </span>to that place <span class="gemarra-regular">after twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the year </span>had passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">we saw that those coals were still glowing. When I came before Ameimar, he said to me: That grass was a drug of life [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">samterei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">those coals were of broom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And God created the great sea monsters” </span>(Genesis 1:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">they interpreted </span>this as a reference to the <span class="gemarra-regular">sea oryx. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent, as it is stated: “In that day the Lord with His sore </span>and great and strong <span class="gemarra-regular">sword </span>will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent” (Isaiah 27:1).
§ The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the following statements of Rav Yehuda citing Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everything; time; Jordan. Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He created male and female. Even leviathan the slant serpent and leviathan the tortuous serpent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He created male and female. And if they would have coupled </span>and produced offspring, they would have <span class="gemarra-regular">destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and killed the female, and salted </span>the female to preserve it for the banquet <span class="gemarra-regular">for the righteous in the future. As it is stated: “And He will slay the serpent that is in the sea” </span>(Isaiah 27:1).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And He created even the beast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the thousand hills </span>(see Psalms 50:10) <span class="gemarra-regular">male and female. And </span>they were so enormous that <span class="gemarra-regular">if they would have coupled </span>and produced offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would have destroyed the entire world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and cooled </span>the sexual desire of <span class="gemarra-regular">the female and preserved it for the righteous in the future. As it is stated </span>about the beasts: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Lo now, his strength is in his loins” </span>(Job 40:16); <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">male. </span>The continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And his force is in the stays of his body”; this </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">female, </span>alluding to the idea that they did not use their genitals for the purpose of procreation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, </span>with regard to the leviathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">let Him castrate the male and cool the female; </span>why was it necessary to kill the female? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fish are unrestrained</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore even if the female was cooled, the female would still procreate. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let Him do the opposite, </span>and kill and preserve the male leviathan. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">salted female is better; if you wish, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with” </span>(Psalms 104:26), the male must be left alive for sport, because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not proper conduct </span>to sport <span class="gemarra-regular">with a female</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to the beasts, <span class="gemarra-regular">let Him </span>preserve the <span class="gemarra-regular">female in salt, </span>instead of cooling it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Salted fish is good, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">salted meat is not good.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: At the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to create the world, He said to the minister of the sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world, </span>so that there will be room for land. The minister of the sea <span class="gemarra-regular">said before Him: Master of the Universe, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough that I will stay within my own </span>waters. God <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately struck him and killed him; as it is stated: “He stirs up the sea with His power, and by His understanding He smites through Rahab” </span>(Job 26:12).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Conclude from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the name of the minister of the sea is Rahab, and were it not for waters </span>of the sea that <span class="gemarra-regular">cover him, no creature could withstand his smell, </span>as his corpse emits a terrible stench. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain; </span>for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the waters cover the sea” </span>(Isaiah 11:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read </span>this phrase as <span class="gemarra-regular">“cover the sea”; rather </span>read it as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Cover the minister of the sea, </span>i.e., the term sea is referring to the minister of the sea, not to the sea itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: The Jordan issues fort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the cave of Pamyas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Jordan issues forth from the cave of Pamyas, and travels in the Sea of Sivkhi, </span>i.e., the Hula Lake, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in the Sea of Tiberias, </span>the Sea of Galilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">and rolls dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Great Sea, and rolls down until it reaches the mouth of the leviathan. As it is stated: “He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth” </span>(Job 40:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ulla strongly objects to this </span>explanation of the verse, stating: But <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written about the beasts on the thousand hills. Rather, Rava bar Ulla said </span>that this is the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">When are the beasts on the thousand hills confident? When the Jordan rushes forth into the mouth of the leviathan.</span>
§ The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the upcoming statements of Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seas; Gabriel; hungry. When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods” </span>(Psalms 24:2)? <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven seas and four rivers that surround Eretz Yisrael. And these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven seas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The Sea of Tiberias, the Sea of Sodom, </span>i.e., the Dead Sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sea of Ḥeilat, the Sea of Ḥeilata, the Sea of Sivkhi, the Sea of Aspamya, and the Great Sea, </span>i.e., the Mediterranean. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are the four rivers: The Jordan, the Jarmuth, and the Keiromyon, and the Piga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are the rivers of Damascus.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: In the future, Gabriel will perform</span>

Daf 75a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a hunt of the leviathan, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Can you draw out leviathan with a fish hook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?” </span>(Job 40:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">And were the Holy One, Blessed be He, not assistin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> Gabriel, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not be able to </span>hunt <span class="gemarra-regular">it, as it is stated: “Only He Who made him can use His sword to approach him” </span>(Job 40:19).
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">leviathan is hungry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he produces breath from his mouth and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">boils all of the waters in the depths </span>of the sea. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “He makes the deep boil like a pot” </span>(Job 41:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the leviathan <span class="gemarra-regular">did not place its head in the Garden of Eden, no creature could withstand his </span>foul <span class="gemarra-regular">smell, as it is stated: “He makes the sea like a seething mixture [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">merkaḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Job 41:23), and the term <span class="it-text">merkaḥa</span> is also used to describe something with a smell (see Exodus 30:25).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when he is thirsty, he makes many furrows in the sea, as it is stated: “He makes a path to shine after him” </span>(Job 41:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says: </span>After the leviathan drinks from the sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">the depth </span>of the sea does <span class="gemarra-regular">not return to its normal condition until seventy years </span>have passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “One would think the deep to be hoary” </span>(Job 41:24), <span class="gemarra-regular">and hoary </span>indicates a person who is <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than seventy </span>years old.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will make a feast for the righteou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the flesh of the leviathan, as it is stated: “The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabbarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will make a feast </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yikhru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of him” </span>(Job 40:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kera</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other than a feast, as it is stated: “And he prepared [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">va’yikhreh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for them a great feast [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; and they ate and drank” </span>(II Kings 6:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabbarim</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other than Torah scholars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “You that dwell in the gardens, the companions [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] hearken for your voice: Cause me to hear it” </span>(Song of Songs 8:13). This verse is interpreted as referring to Torah scholars, who listen to God’s voice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the remainder </span>of the leviathan, they will <span class="gemarra-regular">divide it and use it for commerce in the markets of Jerusalem, as it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “They will part him among the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kena’anim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Job 40:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kena’anim</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other than merchants, as it is stated: “As for the merchant [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kena’an</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves to oppress” </span>(Hosea 12:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “Whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kinaneha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are the honorable of the earth” </span>(Isaiah 23:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will prepare a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for the righteous from the skin of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">leviathan, as it is stated: “Can you fill his skin with barbed irons [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">besukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Job 40:31). If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is deserving </span>of being called righteous, an entire <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prepared for him </span>from the skin of the leviathan; if one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deserving </span>of this honor, <span class="gemarra-regular">a coverin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prepared for his </span>head, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Or his head with fish-spears” </span>(Job 40:31).
If one is <span class="gemarra-regular">deservin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> at least of this reward, <span class="gemarra-regular">a covering is prepared for him, </span>and if one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deserving, a necklace is prepared for him, as it is stated: “And necklaces about your neck” </span>(Proverbs 1:9). If one is somewhat <span class="gemarra-regular">deserving, a necklace is prepared for him, </span>and if one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deserving </span>even of this, only <span class="gemarra-regular">an amu-let is prepared for him </span>from the skin of the leviathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Or will you bind him for your maidens” </span>(Job 40:29), i.e., a small amulet is prepared for him, like the amulets tied on children’s necks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the remaining </span>part of the skin of the leviathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, spreads it on the walls of Jerusalem, and its glory radiates from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">end of the world until the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">end. As it is stated: “And nations shall walk in your light, and kings at the brightness of your rising” </span>(Isaiah 60:3).
§ With regard to the future glory of Jerusalem, the Gemara interprets the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will make your pinnacles of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kadkhod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Isaiah 54:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Two angels in heaven, Gabriel and Michael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with regard to the material that will be used to form the walls of Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that this dispute is between <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amora’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the West, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">And who are they? </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya. One said </span>they will be made of <span class="gemarra-regular">onyx</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one said </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">jasper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Let it be like this [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kedein</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and like that [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukhedein</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., let them be formed from both together. This compromise is indicated by the word <span class="it-text">kadkhod</span>, a combination of this [<span class="it-text">kedein</span>] and that [<span class="it-text">ukhedein</span>].
The Gemara analyzes the rest of that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And your gates of precious stones” </span>(Isaiah 54:12). This should be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>light of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">where Rabbi Yoḥanan sat and taught: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will bring precious stones and pearls that are thirty by thirty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and He will hollow out in them </span>a hole of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten by twenty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and set them in the gates of Jerusalem. A certain </span>unnamed <span class="gemarra-regular">student sneered at him, </span>saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now we do not find </span>precious stones even <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg of a dove, </span>and yet <span class="gemarra-regular">all of this we will find?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>a period of <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>that student’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ship went to sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where <span class="gemarra-regular">he saw ministering angels sitting and sawing precious stones and pearls that were thirty by thirty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hollowed out in them </span>were holes of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten by twenty </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>the angels: <span class="gemarra-regular">For whom are these? They said to him that </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will place them in the gates of Jerusalem. </span>Later, the student <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret, my teacher, it is fitting for you to interpret, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">I saw </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as you said. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Worthless </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you had not seen, you would not have believed; </span>clearly, <span class="gemarra-regular">you are mocking the statement of the Sages. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">set his eyes upon him, and </span>the student was instantly killed <span class="gemarra-regular">and turned into a pile of bones.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, based on a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will make you go upright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">komemiyyut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 26:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>In the future, the Jewish people will have the stature of <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred cubits, equivalent to two </span>times the <span class="gemarra-regular">height [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">komot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of Adam the first </span>man, whose height was one hundred cubits. Rabbi Meir interprets the word <span class="it-text">komemiyyut</span> as two <span class="it-text">komot</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>They will have the stature of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred cubits, corresponding to the Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of the Sanctuary” </span>(Psalms 144:12). But if they are each one hundred cubits tall, how could the Jews enter the gates of Jerusalem, whose entrance gate will be ten by twenty cubits, as claimed by Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Yoḥanan stated </span>that idea, he was not referring to the gates themselves but <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">windows that </span>allow <span class="gemarra-regular">wind </span>to enter.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will fashion seven canopie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every righteous </span>individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy”</span> (Isaiah 4:5). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span>righteous individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, fashions for him a canopy </span>seven times over, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his honor, </span>i.e., greater individuals receive grander and larger canopies.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the above verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should there be <span class="gemarra-regular">smoke in a canopy? Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because anyone whose eyes are narrow, </span>i.e., is stingy, <span class="gemarra-regular">toward Torah scholars in this world, his eyes fill with smoke in the World-to-Come. And why</span> should there be <span class="gemarra-regular">fire in a canopy? Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that each and every one is burned from </span>embarrassment at the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">the canopy of the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace, </span>that I did not merit a canopy as large as his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In a similar manner, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that God said to Moses about Joshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall put of your honor upon him” </span>(Numbers 27:20), which indicates that you should put some of your honor, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not all of your honor. The elders of that generation said: The face of Mose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> was as bright <span class="gemarra-regular">as the face of the sun; the face of Joshua </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">like the face of the moon. Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace, </span>that we did not merit another leader of the stature of Moses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, fashioned ten canopies for Adam the first </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Garden of Eden; as it is stated </span>to Hiram, king of Tyre: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You were in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone </span>was your covering, the carnelian, the topaz, and the emerald, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle, and the smaragd, and gold; the workmanship of your drums and of your holes was in you; they were prepared on the day that you were created” (Ezekiel 28:13). This verse mentions ten items, from carnelian to gold. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven</span> canopies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it states: “Every precious stone,” </span>which is also part of the tally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And the worst of all of them </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">gold, as it is counted last, </span>which indicates that the other items are more valuable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The workmanship of your drums and of your holes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nekavekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Ezekiel 28:13)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Hiram, king of Tyre: </span>Were you in the Garden of Eden when I created all of this for you? <span class="gemarra-regular">I looked at you,</span> saw that you would one day claim divinity for yourself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and created many orifices [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nekavim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the excretory system, so that you would know that you are human and not a god. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what God <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to Hiram: <span class="gemarra-regular">I looked at you</span>

Daf 75b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and I decreed deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Adam the first </span>man, to demonstrate that he was human and not a god.
§ The Gemara returns to the aforementioned verse: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day” (Isaiah 4:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And over those who are invited to it”? Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Jerusalem of the World-to-Come is not like Jerusalem of this world. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem of this world, anyone who wants to ascend </span>there can <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend. </span>With regard to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">of the World-to-Come, only those who are invited to i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> can <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the righteous will be called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him” </span>(Isaiah 43:7). This indicates that one who was created by God and causes Him glory is called by His name. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three were called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they are: The righteous, and the Messiah, and Jerusalem.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous, this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we </span>have just <span class="gemarra-regular">said. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Messiah, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness” </span>(Jeremiah 23:6). With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is writ-ten: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Ezekiel 48:35). <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read </span>the word as <span class="gemarra-regular">“there” [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; rather, </span>read it as: The Lord is <span class="gemarra-regular">its name [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shemah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. Rabbi Elazar says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the righteous will </span>have the name: <span class="gemarra-regular">Holy, recited before them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy” </span>(Isaiah 4:3).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will raise Jerusale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three parasangs upward; as it is stated: “And it shall be lifted up and inhabited in its place” </span>(Zechariah 14:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“in its place”? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to its place, </span>i.e., Jerusalem will be raised to a height whose measure in parasangs corresponds to the measure of its area in square parasangs. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the place </span>of Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">parasangs? Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain elder said to me: I saw the initial Jerusalem, </span>when it was still extant, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>its area <span class="gemarra-regular">was three </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">parasangs.</span>
The Gemara continues to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">And lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is discomfort in ascending </span>to a place so high, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>in a prophecy depicting the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes” </span>(Isaiah 60:8). This indicates that they can easily ascend to Jerusalem, as though they were clouds or doves. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>Incidentally, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>that statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">this cloud </span>mentioned in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is three parasangs high, </span>as it reaches Jerusalem, which will be raised three parasangs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wished to give </span>a set <span class="gemarra-regular">measure for Jerusalem, as it is stated </span>in a prophecy of Zechariah: “And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">Then I said: Where are you going? And he said to me: To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth, and what is its length” </span>(Zechariah 2:5–6).
<span class="gemarra-regular">The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created many cities in Your world for the nations of the world, and You did not give the measure of their length or the measure of their width, </span>i.e., they are not limited by any set measure, but expand as they develop. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, which has Your name in it, and Your Temple in it, and righteous people in it, </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">You give it a measure? Immediately: </span>“And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle within it” </span>(Zechariah 2:7–8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will add to Jerusalem one thousand </span>times the numerical value of <span class="gemarra-italic">tefa</span><span class="gemarra-italic">f </span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">gardens; one thousand </span>times the numerical value of <span class="gemarra-italic">kefel</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">towers; one thousand </span>times the value of <span class="gemarra-italic">litzoy</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">fortifications; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand and two </span>times the value of <span class="gemarra-italic">shilo</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">small houses [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">totpera’ot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And each and every one </span>of these additions <span class="gemarra-regular">will be like </span>the great city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzippori in its prosperity.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the size of the city of Tzippori. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: I saw Tzippori in its prosperity, and there were one hundred and eighty thousand markets of sellers of </span>meat <span class="gemarra-regular">sauces in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>On this basis, one can estimate the future size of Jerusalem.
In a similar manner, the Gemara interprets the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times” </span>(Ezekiel 41:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Three and thirty times”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Levi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnei: If </span>in the future <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>will triple in size, so that it occupies <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>times its former area, then <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span>dwelling will <span class="gemarra-regular">contain thirty stories upward. If </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>will be multiplied by <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty, each and every </span>dwelling will <span class="gemarra-regular">contain three stories above </span>every house.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna, which discusses the acquisition of a ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that there was a dispute among <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> with regard to the manner in which <span class="gemarra-regular">a shi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> is acquired. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Once </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has pulled </span>the ship and moved it by <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>He does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pulls the entire </span>ship to the extent that the end of the ship has at least reached the place previously occupied by its front.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">is parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is an animal acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through passing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">grasped it by its hoof, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by its hair, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by the saddle that is on it, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by the load that is on it, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by the bit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">perumbiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its mouth, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by the bell on its neck, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it. How </span>is an animal acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through pulling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">he calls it and it comes, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he hits it with a stick and it runs before him, once it lifts a foreleg and a hind leg </span>from where it was standing, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it. Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says: </span>It is not enough if the animal lifts its hooves. Rather, one does not acquire it <span class="gemarra-regular">until it walks its full length.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who </span>holds that a buyer can acquire the ship even by moving it only a minimal distance, <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> that it is enough for the animal to lift two legs; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel, who </span>holds that the entire ship must be moved, <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span>with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa </span>that the animal must move its full length? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I state </span>my ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to animals, as although it lifted a foreleg and a hind leg, it stands in its place. But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ship, once a bit of it moves, all of it moves, </span>and therefore the buyer acquires it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say: I stated </span>my ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to animals, as once </span>an animal has <span class="gemarra-regular">lifted a foreleg and a hind </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leg, the other </span>legs <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>ready <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lifted. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ship, if he pulls the entire </span>ship, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he acquires it, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pull the whole ship, he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquire it.
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute of Rav and Shmuel is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A ship is acquired by pulling. Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are acquired by pulling </span>the document

<span class="gemarra-regular">and by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale.
The Gemara clarifies the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Letters </span>in promissory notes, <span class="gemarra-regular">who mentioned </span>anything about <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why would Rabbi Natan speak about promissory notes, which are not discussed by the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete, and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters, </span>i.e., the content of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are acquired by </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">transferring </span>the document, not through pulling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters are acquired by pulling and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for a ship? </span>A ship <span class="gemarra-regular">is movable property, </span>which is acquired not by means of giving a bill of sale, but through other acts of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>correct to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters </span>of credit <span class="gemarra-regular">by passing. Rabbi Natan says: A ship </span>is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling, and letters, </span>i.e. the contents of a promissory note, are acquired either through pulling or <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale.
The Gemara asks: If Rabbi Natan holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">a ship </span>is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling, </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>apparently identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rather, </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two opinions is the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav and Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to the opinion of one <span class="it-text">tanna</span> the buyer must move the entire ship out of its current location, while the other <span class="it-text">tanna</span> maintains that one must move the ship only a minimal amount. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone, </span>Rabbi Natan and the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">either in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel. And with regard to a ship, everyone agrees </span>that it is acquired through pulling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>acquiring <span class="gemarra-regular">letters, </span>i.e. the contents of a promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan is saying to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: With regard to a ship, I certainly concede to you </span>that it is acquired by pulling. But <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to letters, </span>whereas you maintain that passing suffices to acquire them, I hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>in addition <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a bill </span>of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the acquisition is valid, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, </span>the act of passing is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to this interpretation, the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Natan disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Letters, </span>i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are acquired by </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">transferring </span>the document; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Whether one wrote </span>a bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not transfer </span>the promissory note to the buyer, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he transferred </span>the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not write </span>a bill of sale, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the documents <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the seller both <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>a bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">and transfers </span>the promissory note.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">did you interpret </span>the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let a ship be acquired also by passing, </span>not only through pulling, as stated in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A shi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is acquired by passing; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it

Daf 76b

<span class="gemarra-regular">until he pulls it, or until he rents its place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How, then, can the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> be ascribed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi?
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; here, </span>where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi states that a ship is acquired through passing, he is referring to a ship situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. </span>Since a ship in the public domain cannot be acquired through pulling, which must be performed in a domain that is in one’s possession, it is acquired through passing. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the ship is situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">simta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is not the public domain, as both parties have the right to keep their possessions there. A ship in this location must be acquired through pulling.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">did you interpret that last </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> to be referring? It was interpreted as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pulls it </span>or until he rents its place. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the ship is situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from whom can he rent </span>the place? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, does pulling in the public domain effect acquisition? But don’t Abaye and Rava both say </span>with regard to the different methods of acquisition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Passin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisition in the public domai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of </span>the parties; <span class="gemarra-regular">pullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisition in an alleyway or in a courtyard that belongs to both of </span>the parties; <span class="gemarra-regular">and liftin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisition in every place, </span>even in the seller’s domain.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean <span class="gemarra-regular">when it says: Until he pulls it, and what </span>does it mean <span class="gemarra-regular">when it says: Until he rents its place? This </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The buyer does not acquire the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pulls it from the public domain into an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if </span>the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> located in <span class="gemarra-regular">the domain </span>of some other <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until he rents its place </span>from the owner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava state </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, not that of the Rabbis? The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that only Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that one can acquire ownership by means of passing in the public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The Rabbis agree that it is possible to effect acquisition in the public domain through the act of passing. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Go take possession and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">effect acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too </span>he can effect acquisition through the act of passing, and does not need to pull it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Go pull and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">effect acquisitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of it.
Rav Ashi elaborates: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the seller is <span class="gemarra-regular">particula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> about the method by which the item is acquired, and therefore it can be acquired only through pulling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the seller is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">indicating the manne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him, </span>i.e., he advises him to use this act of acquisition but he does not mind if the buyer prefers to perform a different act of acquisition.
§ The Gemara returns to the issues of acquiring promissory notes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: One who sells </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note to another must write to him: Acquire it and all liens on property that are </span>contained <span class="gemarra-regular">within it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi said: I stated </span>this <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Kahana, and I said to him </span>the following analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>the buyer acquires it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote this for him. </span>This indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not write this for him, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the monetary rights recorded in the promissory note.
Rav Ashi asks: Why, then, did he purchase the promissory note? <span class="gemarra-regular">But does he require</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">to tie around the mouth of his flas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> as a stopper? Clearly, he purchased the document for the purpose of collecting the debt recorded in it. Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Yes, </span>it is possible that he purchased the promissory note in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to tie </span>it around his flask. Since the owner did not transfer ownership of the obligation recorded in the promissory note, the buyer acquires only the paper itself. 

Daf 77a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are acquired by </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">transferrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the document to the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: </span>Is your ruling based on <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition or </span>on your own <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is based on <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition. Rav Ashi said: It also </span>stands to <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that the contents of a promissory note are acquired through transferring, <span class="gemarra-regular">as letters, </span>i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are words</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the buyer is acquiring the right to a monetary obligation, not a physical item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and words cannot be acquired through </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">words</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it true that documents <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be acquired through words? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabba Bar Yitzḥak say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: There are two </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">documents. </span>The first type is where one says to others: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take possession of this fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for so-and-s</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and write the document for him </span>as proof of the sale of the field. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may renege with regard to the document</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he may change his mind and tell them not to write it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he may not renege with regard to the field, </span>as the buyer has already acquired it.
The second type of document is where he said: Take possession of this field for so-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that you writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him a document. </span>If the document has not yet been delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">he can retract </span>his instruction <span class="gemarra-regular">both with regard to the document and with regard to the field, </span>as the transfer of the field is dependent on the writing of the document.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: There are </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">documents. Two </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">those that we stated </span>above, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller wrote the document in advance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 77b

This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which we learned </span>in a mishna (167b): A scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">may write a bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for the selle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if the buyer is not with hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> when the seller presents his request. In a case of this kind, <span class="gemarra-regular">once this </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">takes possession of the lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the deed is acquired wherever it is. And this is that which we learned </span>in another mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that does not serve as a guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., movable property, can be <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with property that serves as a guarantee, </span>i.e., land, when the land is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of giving <span class="gemarra-regular">money, or </span>by means of giving <span class="gemarra-regular">a document, or </span>by means of taking <span class="gemarra-regular">possession. </span>This shows that a bill of sale can be transferred without any act of acquisition performed for the document, and certainly through words, which presents a difficulty to Rav Ashi’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: Acquiring a bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>acquisition of land <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is similar to acquisition through an item, not by means of words. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which cannot be acquired through </span>symbolic <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a pro forma act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an item, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired by means of land.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">where Rav Pappa had </span>deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve thousand dinars </span>with bailees <span class="gemarra-regular">in Bei Ḥozai. He transferred </span>ownership of the money in Bei Ḥozai <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa by means of the threshol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his house. </span>The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Bei Ḥozai with the money, Rav Pappa was so happy that he was bringing him his money that he <span class="gemarra-regular">went out </span>all the way <span class="gemarra-regular">until Tavak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>greet <span class="gemarra-regular">him.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that when one sells a ship he has sold various other items; <span class="gemarra-regular">but he has not sold the slaves, nor the packing bags, nor the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">antikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>But when one said to the buyer: You are purchasing the ship and all that it contains, all of these are sold as well. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">antikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the merchandise that is on </span>the ship. This merchandise is not sold together with the ship.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a wagon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakkaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not sold the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mule</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that pull the wagon. Similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the mules, he has not sold the wagon. </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a yoke [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hatzemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not sold the oxen, </span>and one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the oxen has not sold the yoke. Rabbi Yehuda says: The </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">money indicates </span>what one has sold. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the seller: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sell me your yoke for two hundred dinars, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a known matter that a yoke is not </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for two hundred dinars </span>he clearly intended to purchase the oxen as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: The </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">money is not proof.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Taḥlifa, from the West, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Abbahu. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wagon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he has sold the mules </span>together with it. Rabbi Abbahu asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not sold </span>the mules? Rav Taḥlifa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Should <span class="gemarra-regular">I erase </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as it is incorrect? Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>do not erase it; you should <span class="gemarra-regular">explain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the mules <span class="gemarra-regular">are fastened to </span>the wagon. In that situation, one who purchases the wagon receives the mules as well.
The mishna teaches: One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a yoke has not sold the oxen; </span>and the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda disagree over whether the sum of money proves exactly what was sold. The Gemara analyzes their disagreement: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the mishna is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they call a yoke: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzimda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>they call <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Bakar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold him a yoke </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not sell him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen. But </span>if the mishna is referring to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they also call oxen: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzimda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him everything.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>their dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary in a plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where they call a yoke: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzimda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>call <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Bakar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but there are also </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who cal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> oxen: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzimda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since it is unclear what is meant by the term: <span class="it-text">Tzimda</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">money indicates </span>whether he purchased a yoke or oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">money does not </span>serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the </span>amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">money does not </span>serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">proof, </span>then in a case where the buyer paid two hundred dinars and received only a yoke, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transaction be nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 78a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis do not </span>hold that in a case of exploitation of less than one-sixth one must return the money and that if it was more than one-sixth there is <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transaction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> can it be maintained that they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accept these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 56b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a Torah scroll, an animal, or a pearl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> these items <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitation, </span>as they have no fixed price. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The early Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">only these </span>items listed earlier in the mishna, i.e., land, slaves, and documents, are not subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of exploitation. Therefore, the Rabbis should agree that the sale of the yoke is nullified.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that teaches </span>that according to the opinion of the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">money is not proof?</span> This means <span class="gemarra-regular">that the transaction is nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if you wish, say </span>instead that the sale of the yoke is not nullified, because <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Sages spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitation and the nullification of a transaction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> they meant that these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the difference in price is an amount about <span class="gemarra-regular">which one could be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mistaken </span>and believe that this is the correct price. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when </span>the difference in price is so great a sum <span class="gemarra-regular">that one could not be mistaken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this sale is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of exploitation. In that case, one must <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the extra money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the seller as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift; </span>he could not have thought that this was the actual price of the object.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sells a donkey has not sold its vessels, </span>i.e., its equipment, with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥum the Mede says: </span>He has <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its vessels. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold, </span>and there are <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not sold. How so? If the donkey was before him and its vessels </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">on it, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Sell me this donkey of yours, its vessels are sold. </span>If the buyer said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the donkey </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> I wish to purchase it, <span class="gemarra-regular">its vessels are not sold.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>in the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the donkey’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sack and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">saddlebag [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">disakkaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">kumni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a term explained later in the Gemara. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: An ordinary donkey is </span>used primarily <span class="gemarra-regular">for riding, </span>and therefore these articles, which are not used for riding but for carrying burdens, are not included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Naḥum the Mede holds: An ordinary donkey is </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">for carrying </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burdens</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the items that serve this purpose are sold along with the donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the saddle and the saddlecloth, the harness and the saddle band, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are sold, </span>as they are used both for riding and for carrying burdens.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. If a seller says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a donkey and its vessels, this </span>one has <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the saddle, and the saddlecloth, and the harness, and the saddle band</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But he has not sold the sack, and the saddlebag, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kumni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything that is on it, </span>to you; the donkey and <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold. </span>It can be inferred from here that the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the saddle and the saddlecloth </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and its vessels. </span>By inference, if the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say this, </span>the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquire them.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same is true even if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and its vessels. </span>In that case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, the saddle and the saddlecloth are sold. And this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: That even though </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and its vessels, </span>the buyer still <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sack and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">saddlebag and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">kumni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">kumni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-regular">saddle </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">by women</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Does this <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>apply only to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are on </span>the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">but when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥum the Mede concedes to </span>the Rabbis that they are not sold? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">but when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are on </span>the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis concede to Naḥum </span>that the vessels are sold. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything that is on it, </span>the donkey and <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold. </span>In this case, the vessels are on the donkey, and everything is sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are on </span>the donkey, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>that although in general one does not acquire the vessels, if the seller explicitly says that he is selling the donkey and everything on it, the buyer acquires it all. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">but when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are on </span>the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are sold, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>ruling? Even according to the opinion of the Rabbis there is no need to say explicitly that he is selling everything.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>the language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: And when he said to him: </span>I am selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything that is fit to be on it, </span>i.e., those items usually found on a donkey, everything is sold.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold, </span>and there are <span class="gemarra-regular">times when they are not sold. What, is it not </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yehuda is referring to that which the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If so, the dispute between the Rabbis and Naḥum the Mede must be referring to a case where the vessels are on the donkey, as Rabbi Yehuda addresses the same set of circumstances. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, Rabbi Yehuda</span>

Daf 78b

<span class="gemarra-regular">was speaking of a different matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and was not necessarily addressing the same case discussed in the beginning of the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of the dilemma, as it was taught in the previous mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a wagon he has not sold the mules </span>that pull the wagon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Taḥlifa, from the West, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Abbahu: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a wagon, he has sold the mules </span>along with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not sold </span>the mules? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Taḥlifa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Should I erase </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>you should <span class="gemarra-regular">explain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the mules <span class="gemarra-regular">are fastened to </span>the wagon.
One can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>from Rabbi Abbahu’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that the mishna </span>is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the mules <span class="gemarra-regular">are not fastened to</span> the wagon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since the first clause, </span>i.e., the previous mishna, is referring to a case corresponding to <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey, i.e., the mules are not fastened to the wagon, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>the mishna here, must <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span> be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not on </span>the donkey.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, say the first clause, </span>i.e., the preceding mishna: One who sells a ship sells the mast along with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he has not sold either the slaves or the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">antikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And we said: What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">antikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Pappa said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the merchandise that is in </span>the ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to your logic, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the first clause, </span>i.e., the mishna concerning the ship, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">is on </span>the ship, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>the mishna here, must <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are on </span>the donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches each statement </span>individually, and the circumstances of one ruling do not prove that another ruling is referring to a parallel case.
The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>based on the letters of the names of the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> who appear here: <span class="gemarra-italic">Zayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">samekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Abaye said: Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Natan, and Sumakhos, and Naḥum the Mede all hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when a person sells an item, he sells it and all of its accoutrements.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>holds this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (67b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: One who sells an olive press has sold the beam </span>used for pressing the olives, despite the fact that the beam can be removed from the press. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>holds this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (68b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One who sells a city has sold the </span>city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">guardsman. Rabbi Meir </span>holds this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a vineyard, he has sold the accoutrements of the vineyard. Rabbi Natan and Sumakhos </span>hold this, as they state with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bitzit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dugit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the light-going boats of the ship, which they claim are sold when the ship is sold (73a). <span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥum the Mede </span>holds this, as is evident from <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we said </span>in the mishna here.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold, </span>and there are times when they are not sold. How so? If the donkey was before him and its vessels were on it, and the buyer said to him: Sell me this donkey of yours, its vessels are sold. If the buyer said: Is the donkey yours? I wish to purchase it, its vessels are not sold. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in a case where the buyer said: Sell me <span class="gemarra-regular">this donkey of yours, and what is different </span>in a case where he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the donkey yours?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that when the buyer says: Sell me <span class="gemarra-regular">this donkey of yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he knows that the donkey belongs to </span>the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he said to him: This, he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to its vessels. </span>By contrast, when the buyer says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the donkey yours, </span>this indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not know that the donkey belongs to </span>the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying to him: Is the donkey yours that you can sell it to me? </span>In this case, he is interested only in the donkey and not its vessels.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sells </span>a female <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey has sold </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">foal </span>along with it. But one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not sold its young. </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dunghil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold its manure. </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold its water. </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beehiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold the bees </span>in it, and likewise one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has sold </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">doves.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one sells a donkey he has sold its foal, but if one sells a cow he has not sold its calf. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to the </span>buyer that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its young, even the cow and its young </span>should be sold <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. If </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not say to him </span>that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its young, even the donkey </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be sold with its foal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the </span>buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a nursing donkey, or: </span>I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">a nursing cow. Granted, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow, one could say that he needs it for its milk,</span> and the suckling calf would not necessarily be included in the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">is he saying to him </span>that the donkey is nursing? Since he does not need the milk of a donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying to him </span>that he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its young. </span>The Gemara adds tangentially: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>does the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">call </span>a donkey foal <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">seyaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it follows after </span>and obeys <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasant talk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">siḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas an old donkey must be led forcibly.
The Gemara cites a related discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Therefore they that speak in parables [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hamoshlim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] say:</span> Come to Heshbon! Let the city [<span class="it-text">ir</span>] of Sihon be built and established! For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it has devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon” (Numbers 21:27–28)?
The Gemara interprets these verses homiletically. <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Hamoshlim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; these are </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">who rule over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hamoshlim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] their </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination. </span>They will say: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Come to Heshbon,” </span>meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come and let us calculate the account of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeshbono</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the world, </span>i.e., the financial <span class="gemarra-regular">loss </span>incurred by the fulfillment of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in contrast to its reward, and the reward </span>for committing <span class="gemarra-regular">a transgression, </span>i.e., the pleasure and gain received, <span class="gemarra-regular">in contrast to the loss it </span>entails.
<span class="gemarra-regular">“Let it be built and established” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if you </span>make this calculation, <span class="gemarra-regular">you will be built in this world and you will be established in the World-to-Come. </span>The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“city [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of Sihon” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if a person fashions himself like this young donkey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ayir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that follows after pleasant talk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">siḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if one is easily tempted to listen to his inclination, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is written after it? “For a fire is gone out of Heshbon…</span>it has devoured,” i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire will go out from </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who calculate </span>the effect of their deeds in the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">and will consum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who do not calculate </span>and examine their ways but instead do as they please.
A similar interpretation applies to the continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A flame from the city of Sihon”; </span>this means that a flame will come <span class="gemarra-regular">from the city of righteous people, who are called trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">siḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “It has devoured Ar of Moab”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who follows after his inclination like this young donkey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ayir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that follows after pleasant talk. “The lords of the high places of Arnon”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrogant. As the Master says: Every person who has arrogance in him will fall into Gehenna.</span>
The Gemara interprets a subsequent verse: “We have shot at them [<span class="it-text">vanniram</span>], Heshbon is perished, even until Dibon, and we have laid waste even until Nophah, which reaches until Medeba” (Numbers 21:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Vanniram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; </span>this indicates that the <span class="gemarra-regular">wicked </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">says: There is no higher [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ein</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>power governing the world. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Heshbon is perished” </span>means: <span class="gemarra-regular">The account [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeshbon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the world has perished, </span>i.e., they claim there is no accountability for one’s actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Even until Dibon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">divon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”; the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Wait until judgment comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">din</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“And we have laid waste</span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">even until Nophah,” </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">until the fire comes that does not require fanning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nippuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the fire of Gehenna, which will consume them. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Until Medeba [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Medeva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”; </span>this means <span class="gemarra-regular">until their souls are pained [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tadiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And some say </span>an alternative explanation: It means <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">doe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what He wishes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mai</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">deva’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>with them and punishes them as they deserve.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who separates </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">from matters of Torah, a fire consumes him, as it is stated: “And I will set My face against them; out of the fire they come forth, and the fire shall devour them” </span>(Ezekiel 15:7). The Torah is likened to fire in the verse: “Is not My word like fire?” (Jeremiah 23:29). The verse in Ezekiel teaches: “Out of the fire they come forth,” referring to those who separate themselves from the fire of Torah; “and the fire shall devour them,” i.e., they are consumed by the fire of Gehenna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who separates himself from the matters of Torah falls into Gehenna. As it is stated: “The man who strays out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the spirits” </span>(Proverbs 21:16). “The way of understanding” is the way of the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one who departs from the Torah arrives in the place of the <span class="gemarra-regular">spirits, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “But he does not know that the spirits are there; that those whom she has called are in the depths of the netherworld” </span>(Proverbs 9:18).
§ The mishna teaches: One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a dunghill has sold its manure, </span>and one who sold a cistern has sold its water. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Me’ila</span> 12b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>item that is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to</span> be sacrificed on <span class="gemarra-regular">the alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for Temple maintenance, </span>or is fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for Temple maintenance but not for the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or items that are fit <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for the altar nor for Temple maintenanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in their current state and are slated to be sold with the profit used for the Temple, in all these cases if one consecrates these items and then derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them or their contents</span> for a non-sacred purpose, he thereby is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property and is obligated to bring an offering as atonement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated a cistern filled with water, dunghills filled with manure, a dovecote filled with doves, a field filled with plants, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree bearing fruit, </span>and subsequently derived benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them or their contents </span>is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated a cistern and it was later filled with water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dunghill and it was later filled with manure, a dovecote and it later was filled with doves, a tree and it later bore fruit, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and it was later filled with plants, </span>if he derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them </span>he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property but he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property by deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">its contents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated a field or a tree, </span>he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property if he derives benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">them or that which grows from them, because they are growths of consecrated </span>property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears </span>to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, </span>i.e., if one consecrated an empty cistern or dovecote, the water or doves that later fill it do not become consecrated. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the statement of Rabbi Yosei </span>appears to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>when he says that <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears </span>to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, by inference </span>this means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, </span>and Rabbi Yehuda does explicitly disagree in those cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei appears </span>to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, </span>this indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote. But Rabbi Yosei stated </span>his opinion solely <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, </span>as only plants and fruit grow directly from consecrated property, and this reasoning is not relevant in the case of a cistern or dovecote.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas he himself holds that even the items found in a dovecote or a cistern are consecrated, this is difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: I do not see the statement of Rabbi Yehuda </span>as correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, because </span>the plants and the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">are the growths of consecrated </span>property? Infer from here that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree that </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">does not see </span>and accept the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">see </span>and accept his opinion.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears to Rabbi Yosei </span>to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote. </span>In other words, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that even Rabbi Yosei disagrees with </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree. But in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, he concedes to him </span>that the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property does not apply to items that were added afterward and were not present at the time of the consecration.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of cisterns, with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated them </span>when they were <span class="gemarra-regular">empty and they were later filled, </span>if one derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them </span>he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property if he derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from their contents. </span>This ruling will be clarified below. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: </span>One is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>by deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from their contents.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, as the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. But in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, everyone agrees </span>that if one derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them</span> he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property if he derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from their contents.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated them </span>when they were <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>and then derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or from their contents, </span>he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, reverse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> his previous ruling in this case and holds that if the items were consecrated when full their contents are not subject to the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property. 

Daf 79b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>their dispute is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a field and a tree, why does </span>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>his opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabba’s statement must be adjusted, and this is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote. But in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and a tree, everyone agrees </span>that one is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property if one derives benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them or their contents.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern and a dovecote, where </span>the cistern and the dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">are empty, with regard to what </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cistern and the dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">are full, with regard to what do they disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the cases of a cistern and a dovecote that <span class="gemarra-regular">are empty, they disagree with regard to </span>the matter that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis.</span>
The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">because the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say: A person cannot transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an object that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that one does not currently own. Therefore, one cannot consecrate water or doves that will enter the cistern or dovecote only in the future. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an object that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: You can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that you heard Rabbi Meir </span>express this opinion in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit of palm trees, which are likely to come </span>into existence, as the trees naturally produce fruit. But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>doves and water, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that they will come? Rava said: You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>cases where one consecrates water or doves that are likely to arrive, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water that comes by way of his courtyard into the cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> when it rains, so that he does not need to fill the cistern. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">doves that come by way of his </span>other, full <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>this empty <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecote.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cistern and the dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">full, with regard to what </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? Rava said: </span>This dispute concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he consecrated a cistern without specification. And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father, who says: One infers the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of consecration to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of transactions between one <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and another.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> with regard to transactions between one <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary </span>person and another is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can say: I sold you the cistern </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not sell you the water </span>it contains, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in the case of consecration to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High </span>is that one can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">I consecrated the cistern </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not consecrate the water </span>within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not infer the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of consecration to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of transactions between one ordinary person and another. Rather, one who consecrates property does so generously, i.e., the most expansive meaning is assumed for his vow of consecration, and therefore even if he did not say so explicitly, he consecrated the water together with the cistern.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> concerning a transaction with <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>person say that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sell the water along with the cistern? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna (78b) that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cistern has sold its water? Rava said: </span>The ruling in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is an individual </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not sold its water. Rabbi Natan says: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a cistern has sold its water. </span>

Daf 80a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who buys the produce of a dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the doves that will hatch over the course of the year in a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">must leave [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mafriaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>pair of doves from the <span class="gemarra-regular">broo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for the seller. If one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of a beehive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., all the bees produced from a beehive over the course of the year, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">takes three swarm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the bees <span class="gemarra-regular">impotent, </span>so that they will stop producing offspring and instead produce only honey. One who buys <span class="gemarra-regular">honeycomb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must leave two combs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">olive </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">for felling, he must leave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two shoot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for the seller.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who buys the brood of a dovecote must leave the first pair of the brood for the seller. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that one must leave the <span class="gemarra-regular">first and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>pairs of <span class="gemarra-regular">a brood </span>for the seller? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement in the mishna is referring to the pair left <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the first pair of the brood <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>i.e., an extra pair of doves must be left behind to ensure that the first brood will not fly away. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a pair left <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the pair discussed in the mishna. In other words, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is saying that one must leave a pair of doves for the mother, and later a second pair from the brood of her children, which is the pair mentioned by the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the mother </span>that there is no concern that she will escape from the dovecote? If the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that she is attached to her daughter and the mat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which one leaves for her, </span>this should also be true with regard to the daughter, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">she too will become attached to her mother and the mate which one leaves for her. </span>Why, then, is it necessary to leave behind a pair of the daughter’s own brood to ensure that the daughter will not leave? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A mother is attached to her daughter, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter is not attached to her mother. </span>Therefore, in order for the daughter to remain in the dovecote it is necessary to leave the daughter’s brood with her.
§ The mishna teaches that one who buys the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce of a beehive takes three swarms and </span>then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the bees <span class="gemarra-regular">impotent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesares</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">By what </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">does he render them impotent? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>He renders them impotent <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>feeding them <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard. They say in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard </span>itself that <span class="gemarra-regular">renders them impotent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, since their mouths sting </span>from the bitterness of the mustard, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return and eat their own honey. </span>Due to their excessive eating of honey, they cease to form new swarms and instead produce honey for the seller.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>This is not the meaning of <span class="it-text">mesares</span>. Rather, the mishna should be understood as follows: One <span class="gemarra-regular">takes three swarms by skipping [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beseirus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> every other swarm, so that the buyer receives the first, third, and fifth swarms, while the others remain with the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">three swarms one after the other, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward he takes one and leaves one.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that one who buys <span class="gemarra-regular">honeycombs must leave two combs </span>and one who buys olive trees for felling must leave two shoots. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says: </span>As long as <span class="gemarra-regular">honey </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the beehive it never leaves </span>its status as <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>i.e., it is always considered fit for human consumption. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that honey <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require </span>that one have <span class="gemarra-regular">intentio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to eat it for it to be susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Honey in a beehive is not </span>considered to have the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">either food or liqui</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with regard to ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that honey is considered neither food nor liquid, <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those two combs </span>mentioned in the mishna, which are designated for the sustenance of the bees and are not for human consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer. </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 10:7): Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a beehive, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with regard to the manner in which one purchases it and with regard to other matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes a document that prevents the Sabbatical Yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from canceling an outstanding debt [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on it, </span>as a <span class="it-text">prosbol</span> can be written only if the debtor possesses land of some sort.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a beehive <span class="gemarra-regular">is not susceptible to ritual impurity, </span>provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in its place </span>and attached to the ground, as it is considered equivalent to the ground itself, which is not susceptible to impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who takes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">out of it on Shabbat </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>like one who uproots something from the ground. According to this opinion, honey in a beehive is not considered to have the status of either food or liquid with regard to ritual impurity, as it is attached to the ground.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>A beehive has the status of movable property; <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not write a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on it, and it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like land </span>with regard to its sale but is instead sold in the manner of movable property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is susceptible to ritual impurity </span>even when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in its place, and one who takes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">out of it on Shabbat is exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from bringing a sin-offering. According to this opinion, the honey contained within the beehive is considered detached from the ground and is therefore susceptible to ritual impurity, as stated by Rav Kahana.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written </span>with regard to Jonathan: “He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">and dipped it in the honeycomb </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ya’arat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hadevash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(I Samuel 14:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, what does a forest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ya’ar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have to do with honey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">devash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>Why is the honeycomb called a forest of honey [<span class="it-text">ya’arat</span> <span class="it-text">hadevash</span>]? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forest, one who picks </span>fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a tree <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">honey, one who removes </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a beehive <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Honey that flows from one’s beehive is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">either food or liquid. Granted, according to </span>the reasoning of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well, </span>since he would explain here, as in the previous case, that this is referring to the two combs in the beehive designated for the sustenance of the bees, and is not intended for human consumption.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>who says that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer, this presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty, </span>as even according to Rabbi Eliezer the honey is not considered attached to the ground once it leaves the beehive. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the honey <span class="gemarra-regular">flowed onto a repulsive vesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and therefore is unfit for human consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov said: </span>It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it flowed onto straw [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kashkashin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and weeds, which renders it inedible.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Honey in one’s beehive is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">either food or liquid. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one intended to </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">food, it </span>is susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>and if one intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>use it as <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid, it is susceptible to ritual impurity as liquid. Granted, according to </span>the reasoning of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well, </span>as he can explain that this too is referring to the two combs of honey left for the bees, and that if one reconsidered and decided to eat the honey, it is once again considered fit for human consumption.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rava, </span>who said that the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that honey in a beehive does not have the status of food or liquid is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, this poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not accord with the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer, as he maintains that one’s intention is not enough for honey attached to the ground to be considered as though it were detached. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, and yet it contradicts Rav Kahana’s statement that intention is not required for honey to be susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in fact in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and you should resolve the difficulty <span class="gemarra-regular">and answer like this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one intended to </span>use the honey as <span class="gemarra-regular">food, it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>and if one intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> use it as <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid. </span>The Gemara notes: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana: Honey in one’s beehive is susceptible to ritual impurity </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>even if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">no intention </span>to use it as food, as it has an innate status of food.
§ The mishna teaches: If one buys <span class="gemarra-regular">olive </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">for felling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he must leave two shoot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One who buys a tree from another for felling must cut </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth above the ground, </span>to allow the tree to grow again. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an untrimmed sycamore, </span>he must cut the tree a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>above the ground, and with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large sycamore, </span>which has strong roots because the sycamore has been cut down once already, he must cut the tree a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths </span>above the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of reeds or of vines, </span>he may cut only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the knot and above, </span>so that they will grow back. <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">of palm and of cedar </span>trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may dig down and uproot </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">because their trunks do not replenish </span>themselves after they are cut down, and therefore there is no reason to leave anything behind.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require an untrimmed sycamore </span>to be cut a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>above the ground for it to grow back? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 4:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not fell an untrimmed sycamore during the Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">work</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it promotes the growth of the tree.
The mishna continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for one to fell the tree during the Sabbatical Year <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner; rather, he must cut </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>above the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">or raze </span>the tree until it is <span class="gemarra-regular">even with the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Neither of these methods promote the growth of the tree; in fact, they damage it. It can be inferred from here that it is only cutting the sycamore until it is <span class="gemarra-regular">even with the ground that is harmful </span>for it, and it does not grow again. Cutting in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">is beneficial for it, </span>even if it is cut less than three handbreadths from the ground.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that the mishna should be understood as follows: Cutting down a sycamore from a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths is beneficial for it, </span>whereas cutting it so that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">even with the ground is certainly harmful for it </span>and is permitted during the Sabbatical Year. Cutting it down <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>i.e., between the ground and three handbreadths, is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">harmful for it nor </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial for it. With regard to the Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">we perform </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that is certainly harmful to it, </span>so as to avoid enhancing it. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to buying and selling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we perform </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that is certainly beneficial for it, </span>as the seller intended to sell the sycamore in such a manner that the tree would grow again.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of palm and cedar trees, </span>a buyer may <span class="gemarra-regular">dig down and uproot </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">because their trunks do not replenish </span>themselves after being cut down. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it correct with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cedar </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its trunk does not replenish </span>itself? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani teach: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon” </span>(Psalms 92:13)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If “palm tree” is stated, why is “cedar” stated? And if “cedar” is stated, why is “palm tree” stated? </span>What is added by this double comparison?
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“cedar” and had not stated “palm tree,” I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a cedar does not produce fruit, so too, a righteous person does not produce fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he will have no reward in the World-to-Come. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, it is stated: “Palm tree,” </span>which is a fruit-bearing tree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“palm tree” and had not stated “cedar,” I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree its trunk does not replenish </span>itself after being cut down, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a righteous person, his trunk does not replenish </span>itself, i.e., he will be unable to recover from misfortune. <span class="gemarra-regular">There-fore, it is stated: “Cedar,” </span>to indicate that just as the trunk of the cedar replenishes itself, so too, the righteous will thrive again. This demonstrates that the trunk of a cedar does grow again.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with what are we are dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with other types of cedars, </span>as the trunks of certain species do not grow back after the tree is felled. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rav: There are ten types of cedars; as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">erez</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], the acacia tree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shitta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and the myrtle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hadas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and the pine tree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">etz</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; I will set </span>in the desert the juniper [<span class="it-text">berosh</span>], the teak [<span class="it-text">tidhar</span>], and the cypress [<span class="it-text">te’ashur</span>] all together” (Isaiah 41:19). The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-italic">Erez</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar; </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shitta</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">acacia tree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tornita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hadas</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">myrtle; </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etz</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shemen</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">balsam tree; </span><span class="gemarra-italic">berosh</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">juniper [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">berati</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tidhar</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">teak [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shaga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">te’ashur</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">cypress [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shurbina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">these are seven </span>species of cedar, not ten. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: They added to </span>the list of cedars <span class="gemarra-italic">allonim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">almonim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">almugim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Allonim</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">pistachio trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">butnei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">almonim</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">oaks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">balutei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-italic">almugim</span>

Daf 81a

refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">coral trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kasita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the other three are as follows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aronim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">armonim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">almugim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aronim</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">laurel trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span><span class="gemarra-italic">armonim</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">plane trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dulevei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-italic">almugim</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">coral trees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kasita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who buys two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the field of another, this </span>one has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">ground, </span>but only the trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>He has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground </span>under them. The mishna states a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>: If the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">grew, </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">may not cut down </span>their branches, despite the fact that their shade damages his field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which grows out of the trunk </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">his, </span>i.e., it belongs to the owner of the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that which grows <span class="gemarra-regular">out of the roots </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>their owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground </span>where the trees had stood.
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">bought three </span>trees, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground </span>along with them. If <span class="gemarra-regular">they grew, </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut down </span>their branches, as he sold a specific piece of land along with the trees, not his entire field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which grows out of the trunk and out of the roots </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">his, </span>i.e., it belongs to the owner of the trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the owner of the trees still <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>possession of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it was sold along with the trees.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> 1:6): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who buys two trees in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, he brings </span>the first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not recite </span>the passages of thanks to God that appear in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:1–11), as the land does not belong to him and therefore he cannot state: “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: He brings </span>the first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">recites </span>the passage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplace </span>to bring first fruits, not only one who grew the fruits on his own tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>did he derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>an apparently <span class="gemarra-regular">superfluous mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Since </span>Rabbi Meir already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of two trees <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>possession of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground, </span>isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that he brings </span>first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites </span>the passage? What is added by his statement in the mishna in <span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn from </span>the mishna in <span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to bring first fruits to the Temple. Rabbi Meir is saying that even if the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis that one who buys two trees does not own the ground between them, he still must bring the first fruits and recite the passage of thanks.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: “Which you shall bring in from your land” </span>(Deuteronomy 26:2)? This verse indicates that the fruit must be the produce of your land, not land that belongs to another. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>land that is <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, which is not the land of the Jewish people. It does not exclude land that does not belong to that specific individual.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: </span>“The choicest first fruits of <span class="gemarra-regular">your lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> you shall bring” (Exodus 23:19)? The Gemara answers: This serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>fruit bought by a Jew that was grown on the <span class="gemarra-regular">land of a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: </span>“I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">which You, </span>Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">have given me” </span>(Deuteronomy 26:10)? If he purchased the fruit, then the land on which it grew was not given to him by God. The Gemara answers that the phrase “which You have given me” can mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that You have given me money, and with that </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">I bought </span>this fruit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Shmuel from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who buys one tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another brings </span>first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not recite </span>the passage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he did not acquire </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">land; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of Shmuel’s opinion, as he said that according to Rabbi Meir even one who simply purchases fruit is obligated to bring first fruits to the Temple.
Apropos the discussion of the obligation to bring first fruits of one who buys a tree in the field of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said to Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale of Rabbi Meir </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one tree, </span>an individual is obligated to bring first fruits but does not recite the passage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is the rationale of the Rabbis </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two trees, </span>an individual is obligated to bring the first fruits but does not recite the passage? If one owns the ground and is obligated to bring the first fruits to the Temple, he should also recite the passage of thanks. If he does not own the ground and therefore is not obligated to recite the passage, why does he bring the first fruits to the Temple? Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you ask me </span>publicly, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the study hall, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter for which the early </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give a reason, in order to embarrass me? </span>In other words, I do not know the reason, as not even the early Sages explained this matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: What is the difficulty? Perhaps Rabbi Meir is uncertain, in </span>the case of an individual who purchases <span class="gemarra-regular">one tree, </span>whether or not the buyer owns the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis are uncertain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the case of an individual who purchases <span class="gemarra-regular">two trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whether or not the buyer owns the ground. Due to this uncertainty, the owner of the tree must bring the first fruits to the Temple, as he might be obligated in this mitzva. He does not recite the passage of thanks because it is not definitely established that he is obligated to bring the fruits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>Rabbi Meir really <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>whether the buyer owns the ground? <span class="gemarra-regular">But it teaches: Since he did not acquire </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">land; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>Rabbi Meir states definitively that the owner of the tree does not own the ground. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he did not acquire </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us be concerned that perhaps </span>these fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">are not first fruits, and he is bringing non-sacred </span>fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>which is prohibited. The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he consecrates them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to eat </span>first fruits, and he cannot do so if they are consecrated. The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">redeems them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they are not first fruits, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">he removes them from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and tithes, </span>as one does not separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from first fruits. The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he separates </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from the fruits, due to the uncertainty over their status.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span> that he separates from these fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives to a priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the priest may partake of it, as it has the halakhic status of either first fruits or <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>, both of which are eaten by a priest. It is understood with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">second tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well; he gives it to a priest, </span>who eats it in Jerusalem, either as first fruits or as second tithe. If it is the third or the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, when instead of second tithe one is obligated to give the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor man’s tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> here <span class="gemarra-regular">too, he gives it to a poor priest, </span>who eats it as either first fruits or poor man’s tithe. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is </span>given to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Levite, to whom can he give it? </span>A Levite may not eat first fruits.
The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gives it to a priest, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span> is given only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe </span>is given only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Levite; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: First tithe </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they are </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">first fruits and require recitatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the passage of thanks, and yet the owner does not recite it due to the uncertainty. The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">recitation </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not indispensable, </span>i.e., one can perform the mitzva of bringing first fruits without the recitation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is the recitation <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>indispensable? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say </span>in the context of offerings: For <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>measure of flour <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for mixin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> with oil in a meal-offering, the lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">mixing does not invalidate</span> the meal-offering. Even though there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, the meal-offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>measure of flour <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not suitable for mixing </span>with oil in a meal-offering, the lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">mixing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalidates </span>the meal-offering. The principle is: <span class="it-text">Ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> requirements prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva in situations where they are not merely absent but impossible. Accordingly, first fruits that are unfit for recitation should not be brought to the Temple.
The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he renders them </span>exempt from the obligation of recitation, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, who says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">harvested </span>the fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and sent the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the possession of an agent, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">agent died on the way</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner or any other person <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>the first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not recite </span>the passage of thanks. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? As it is written: And you shall take, and you shall bring. </span>The Gemara is citing from the following verse with a slight variation: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that the Lord your God gives you” (Deuteronomy 26:2). 

Daf 82a

The passage is not recited <span class="gemarra-regular">until the taking and the bringing </span>of the first fruits are performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is not</span> the case here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Since </span>the passage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">verses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let him read them. </span>What is objectionable about reciting verses from the Torah?
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The problem is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this practice <span class="gemarra-regular">has the appearance of falsehood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because he issues a declaration before God that is possibly untrue, as he might not own the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Ḥiyya, said: </span>The declaration is not recited <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he come to remove </span>the fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and tithes, </span>if they are treated entirely as first fruits. For this reason one does not recite the passage, to ensure that their unique status is maintained.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one who buys two trees in the field of another, if the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">grew, </span>the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">may not cut down </span>their branches. The mishna further teaches: That which grows out of the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but that which grows out of the roots belongs to the owner of the ground. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which something is considered to be growing <span class="gemarra-regular">out of the trunk, and what are the circumstances </span>in which it is considered to be growing <span class="gemarra-regular">out of the roots?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that sees the face of the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., which is visible and aboveground, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered to be growing <span class="gemarra-regular">out of the trunk. And </span>with regard to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which does not see the face of the sun </span>but is concealed in the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span> considered to be growing <span class="gemarra-regular">out of the roots.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if everything that is visible belongs to the owner of the tree, no matter how close it is to the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us be concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps the land is covered with sediment </span>from flowing water, and some of the tree’s trunk will be covered, in which case the branches that grow from the trunk will appear as though they are separate trees; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the trees will <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the field: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">sold me three </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">and I </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>ownership over the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground. Rather, Rav Naḥman said: </span>That which grows from the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he must cut </span>it down. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise said: </span>The owner of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">must cut </span>it down.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: We hold </span>by tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">palm tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> bought from another <span class="gemarra-regular">has no trunk. Rav Zevid thought to say </span>this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the palm tree has no </span>right to that which grows from the <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that since it stands </span>ready <span class="gemarra-regular">to be dug up and uprooted, </span>as when the tree dies its owner is not entitled to plant another in its place, <span class="gemarra-regular">he diverts his mind </span>from that which grows from the trunk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to this: But </span>this is comparable to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">buys two tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in a field belonging to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>ready <span class="gemarra-regular">to be dug up and uprooted </span>because their owner has no right to plant new trees in their place when they die; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that he has </span>the right to that which grows from the <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk. Rather, Rav Pappa said: </span>The statement of Rav Naḥman means that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of a palm tree, </span>in contrast to owners of other types of trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>right to that which grows from the <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, since </span>a palm tree <span class="gemarra-regular">does not produce </span>branches from its <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid, </span>who maintains that Rav Naḥman is referring to all types of trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Zevid interprets the mishna as referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">bought </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">for five year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and stipulated that he may plant new trees in place of the original trees in the event the original ones are cut down.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one bought three </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground </span>along with them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>of the field does he acquire? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the ground that is located <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath </span>the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, and </span>with regard to the space <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of </span>the trees and their branches,

Daf 82b

he has acquired an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient for a gatherer of figs and his basket </span>in hand to stand close to the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar objects to this: Now </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has no pat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and must purchase a path through the field to access his trees; if so, does <span class="gemarra-regular">he have </span>possession of an area for <span class="gemarra-regular">the gatherer and his basket? </span>The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">He has no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">path, </span>even though he has no other means of gaining access to the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the ground he acquired along with the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">another land </span>and is not part of the rest of the field. Why, then, would <span class="gemarra-regular">he have </span>possession of an area for <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatherer and his basket?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says: From the statement, </span>i.e., the objection, <span class="gemarra-regular">of our teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">has no path, </span>as the buyer acquired a separate piece of land along with the trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>trees the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>a path, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he says to </span>the owner of the field: My trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are standing on your land, </span>and as I am allowed to use your field to tend to my trees I have the right to walk through your land to reach them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar does not </span>accept the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">his teacher? As Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously. </span>According to Rabbi Akiva, one sells in a manner that is advantageous for the buyer, and is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified. In this case, as he has sold a tree that remains on his property, the seller grants the buyer the right to access his tree.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Even if Rabbi Elazar himself agrees with Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna cannot be explained in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span>Rather, the mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that one who sells does so sparingly, and the difficulty that Rabbi Elazar raised against Rabbi Yoḥanan is predicated on the fact that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does Rava derive that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If the three trees <span class="gemarra-regular">grew, </span>the owner of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">may cut down </span>the branches that extend into his field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, why may he cut </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">down? Doesn’t </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells, sells generously?</span>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This does not prove that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. You can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that Rabbi Akiva stated </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a pit and a cistern </span>that are situated in a field belonging to another, which one sells in a generous manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they do not weaken the land. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">did you hear him </span>say that the seller is generous toward the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which can weaken the land?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva concede in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that leans out into the field of another, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the owner of the other field <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts down </span>the branches until the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>height of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox-goad, </span>the handle that protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">over a plow? </span>Since the extending branches impede his efforts to plow his field, it is permitted for him to cut them down. This indicates that even according to Rabbi Akiva one does not grant privileges that are detrimental to his own interests. If so, the mishna can be explained even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, which indicates that Rabbi Elazar does not accept his ruling.
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: </span>If one buys three trees in a field belonging to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>the ground that is found <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath </span>the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, and outside of </span>the trees and their branches <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>sufficient for <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatherer of figs and his basket.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Those </span>areas around the trees that are designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatherer of figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his basket </span>are used for this purpose only at specific times. <span class="gemarra-regular">Who sows </span>that land during the rest of the year, the owner of the trees or the owner of the field? Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You learned </span>the answer in a mishna (99b): If one owns a garden that is surrounded by the garden of another, the owner of the inner garden has a right to a path through the outer garden. Even so, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>garden <span class="gemarra-regular">may sow the path.</span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Are </span>the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, </span>in the case of the outer and inner gardens, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no loss </span>suffered <span class="gemarra-regular">by the buyer </span>when the owner of the outer garden sows the path, as he can still pass through it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, there is a loss for the buyer, as </span>the one who bought the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the owner of the field: The <span class="gemarra-regular">fruits </span>that fall from the trees will become <span class="gemarra-regular">soile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by the plants.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar only to the last clause </span>of that mishna, which states: If the owner of the inner garden is given a side path, so that he suffers a loss of some kind because he cannot take the shortest path to reach his garden, both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner of the inner garden <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>owner of the outer garden <span class="gemarra-regular">are not permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sow </span>the path. Similarly, here too, neither the owner of the trees nor the owner of the field are permitted to sow the place designated for the gatherer of figs and his basket.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abaye: This </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>the ground that is found <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath </span>the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, and outside of </span>the trees and their branches <span class="gemarra-regular">an area </span>sufficient for <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatherer of figs and his basket. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>owner of the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are not permitted to sow it.</span>
The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">must there be betwee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> the three trees for them to be considered one unit, which means that the land is acquired by the owner of the trees? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The distance between the trees must be <span class="gemarra-regular">from four cubits to eight </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>It must be <span class="gemarra-regular">from eight </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">to sixteen </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Do not disagree with Rav Naḥman, as we learned </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishna in accordance with his </span>opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 4:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by sixteen cubits, </span>i.e., he leaves sixteen cubits between each row of vines, is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to bring </span>other species of <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>to the empty spaces between the rows and sow them <span class="gemarra-regular">there. </span>This is not considered a violation of the biblical prohibition with regard to sowing diverse crops in a vineyard, which is one of the prohibitions of diverse kinds.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an incident in </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzalmon, where one </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">planted his vineyard sixteen by sixteen cubits. And he would tur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the branche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">two rows </span>that were facing each other <span class="gemarra-regular">to one side, </span>so that there was a space of sixteen cubits between the two rows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sow the clearing. The following year he would turn the branches to the place </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">sown </span>the year before, <span class="gemarra-regular">and would sow </span>the land that had been left <span class="gemarra-regular">uncultivated </span>the previous year, as it had been filled with the branches from the vines. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the incident came before the Sages and they permitted it. </span>This demonstrates that sixteen cubits between plants is required for them to be considered separate units.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I do not know </span>about this, <span class="gemarra-regular">but there was </span>a similar <span class="gemarra-regular">incident</span>

Daf 83a

involving the sale of trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in a village of shepherds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they came before Rav Yehuda, and he said to </span>the seller: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give to </span>the one who bought the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ox and its vessels. But I did not know how much </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ox and its vessels. When I heard that which we learned </span>in a mishna (26a), I came to a conclusion with regard to this case. The mishna teaches as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not plan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree close by the field of another, unless he places it at a distance </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits from </span>the other field.
Rav Yosef continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>this mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">for the work of the vineyard, </span>so that he does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while tending to his vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>studied this mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Learn from it </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sufficient for the ox and its vessels, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>At this stage, the Gemara has demonstrated that Rav Naḥman’s opinion is supported by a mishna, whereas Rav Yosef’s ruling is supported by the incident involving Rav Yehuda.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>a ruling in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 4:9) <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef? </span>That mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who plants his vineyard eight cubits by eight </span>cubits, i.e., he leaves eight cubits between each row of vines, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring seeds to </span>the empty spaces between the rows. This ruling can be cited in support of the opinion of Rav Yosef that if there is a space of eight cubits between trees or vines they are not considered one unit. Why, then, is this mishna not brought as proof?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even so, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable </span>to cite the <span class="gemarra-regular">incident </span>in Tzalmon as proof. Whenever possible, it is preferable to provide support for an opinion by means of a practical ruling, as it demonstrates that the Sages took action in accordance with that opinion and did not merely teach it as <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in theory.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the analysis of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, we hear </span>about the maximum distance that the trees can be <span class="gemarra-regular">scattered, and we hear </span>about the minimum distance that they can be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">close together. </span>The distance that the trees can be <span class="gemarra-regular">scattered </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we said, </span>i.e., eight cubits. The minimum distance that they can be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">close together </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 5:2): <span class="gemarra-regular">A vineyard that is planted </span>in consecutive rows <span class="gemarra-regular">with less than four cubits </span>between the rows <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, </span>because the rows are planted too close together. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Shimon. And the Rabbis say: </span>It is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, and one views the middle </span>vines <span class="gemarra-regular">as if they are not </span>there, as they are slated to be uprooted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the analysis of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, we hear </span>the maximum distance that the trees can be <span class="gemarra-regular">scattered,</span> i.e., sixteen cubits, as in the incident in Tzalmon. Concerning the minimum distance that they can be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">close together, did we hear </span>this distance? The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>based on <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning; from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that according to Rabbi Shimon </span>the minimum distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the maximum distance, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis as well, </span>the minimum distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the maximum, i.e., eight cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that one who buys three trees acquires the land if the distance between the trees is anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">from four cubits to sixtee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> cubits. This ruling is a combination of the two opinions, which is favorable to the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava: How close </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">they be? Four cubits. And how far apart </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">they be? Sixteen </span>cubits.
If one bought three trees planted in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one has acquired </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land and the </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">between them. Therefore, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the tree dried up or was cut down he has </span>ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">land. </span>If the distance between the trees was <span class="gemarra-regular">les</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than this or more than this, or if he bought </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other, this </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired either the land or the trees that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">between them. Therefore, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the tree dried up or was cut down he has no </span>ownership over the <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: When one measures </span>the distance between the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">does he measure from the narrow plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> on the trunk of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">or does he measure from the wide place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 7:1): When one comes to measure from <span class="gemarra-regular">the layered branc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the vin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he measures only from the second root, </span>as this is the average, not the widest part of the vine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: </span>If the owner of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">three branches </span>that grew from one <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and its trunk was covered with earth so that the branches appeared to be three separate trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Are they considered three trees, which would mean that their owner acquires the ground between them?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 7:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who layers </span>the branches of <span class="gemarra-regular">three vine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> into the ground so that they take root while still attached to the base of the vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their roots </span>that rise above the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">are visible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If there is </span>a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">between them of four cubits to eight </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">they combine </span>to form one vineyard composed of six grapevines. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, they do not combine. </span>It can be inferred from this mishna that the different branches of a tree are considered separate entities when the trunk is covered by earth, provided the required distance between them is maintained.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: </span>If the owner of a field <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in his fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">border</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Similarly, if one bought <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>one person <span class="gemarra-regular">and one in </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Do the trees combine to form one unit of three trees, or not? The Gemara states that this dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. 

Daf 83b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises a dilemma: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> situated between the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that it divides </span>between the trees, and therefore the owner of the trees does not acquire the ground? Similarly, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a stream of water, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that it divides </span>between the trees? With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">public thoroughfar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that divides between trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Finally, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a line of palm trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? No answer is found for these problems, and the Gemara states that the dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Hille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises a dilemma before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a cedar grew between </span>the three trees that one bought, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara asks: If it <span class="gemarra-regular">grew, </span>then it <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged in his domain, </span>as he already owns the ground, and therefore it is obvious that the cedar belongs to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the dilemma is as follows: If, when one bought three trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">was a cedar between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it considered a division between the three trees? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Since he bought the trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>has thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the cedar <span class="gemarra-regular">and acquired </span>the land between them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what manner </span>must the three trees be <span class="gemarra-regular">positioned </span>for the buyer to acquire the ground between them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>They may be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in a straight line, and Shmuel says: </span>They must be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the form of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tripod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara notes: According to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that the trees may be positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">in a straight line, all the more so </span>one acquires the ground when the trees are planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the form <span class="gemarra-regular">a tripod. But </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>they must be positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">in a tripod, </span>the buyer acquires the ground only in this case; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the trees were planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in a straight line, </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquire the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>when the trees are planted in the form of a straight line <span class="gemarra-regular">one can sow between them, </span>and therefore the seller would not relinquish his right to the ground between the trees.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna objects to this: And according to the one who says </span>that the trees must be planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the form of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tripod, what is the reason </span>that one who buys the trees acquires the ground? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">that one cannot sow between </span>the trees? <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold him three Roman thorny shrubs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where one cannot sow between them, so too </span>would he say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ground? </span>The other Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Hamnuna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>Roman shrubs <span class="gemarra-regular">are not significant, </span>as they are merely shrubs and not trees, and therefore the ground is not acquired when one purchases them. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">are important.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sells the head </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a large domesticated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not sold </span>along with it <span class="gemarra-regular">the forelegs, </span>as each part is considered important in its own right. All the more so, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the forelegs he has not sold the head. </span>Similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the windpipe </span>and the lungs <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not sold the liver, </span>despite the fact that they are sometimes attached, and if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the liver he has not sold the windpipe </span>and lungs. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>domesticated animals, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the head he has sold the forelegs, </span>although if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the legs he has not sold the head. </span>Likewise, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the windpipe </span>and lungs <span class="gemarra-regular">he has sold the liver, </span>but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold the liver he has not sold the windpipe </span>and lungs.
There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>basic <span class="gemarra-regular">cases with regard to seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and buyers. If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him wheat </span>and said that the wheat was <span class="gemarra-regular">good, and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the buyer, </span>but not the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">can renege on </span>the sale. If the seller sold him what he thought was <span class="gemarra-regular">bad </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">good</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the seller can renege on </span>the sale but the buyer cannot. If he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">bad </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">good, neither one of them can renege on </span>the sale, as the condition of the sale was met.
If the seller sold <span class="gemarra-regular">reddish-brow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">white, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">white </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">reddish-brown, </span>and similarly, if he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">olive wood and it is found </span>to be wood <span class="gemarra-regular">of a sycamore, </span>or he sold wood <span class="gemarra-regular">of a sycamore and it is found </span>to be wood <span class="gemarra-regular">of an olive </span>tree, or if the seller sold him <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>in all of these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>the seller and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">can renege on </span>the sale. Since the sale was for a different item than that which was delivered, the transaction can be nullified even if there was no mistake with regard to the price.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: </span>If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him </span>an item that was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth five </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">for six </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">became more expensive and </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at eight</span> dinars, and the seller wished to return the money and cancel the sale because the item’s value had increased, <span class="gemarra-regular">who was exploited </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">The buyer; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer, but not the seller, can renege on </span>the sale, despite the fact that in such a situation the seller loses out. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span>

Daf 84a

the buyer can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the seller: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you had not exploited me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you would not be able to renege on </span>the sale, and I would receive the profit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you have exploited me, can you renege on </span>the sale and benefit? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If the seller sold him wheat while claiming that the wheat was <span class="gemarra-regular">good, and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, the buyer can renege on </span>the sale. This implies that the buyer can renege <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the seller, </span>even in a situation where the seller would want to renege on the sale, e.g., if the item became more expensive.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him </span>an item that was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth six </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">for five </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its price was reduced and </span>its value now <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at three </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">who was exploited </span>in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">The seller; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller, but not the buyer, can renege on </span>the sale. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: If you had not exploited me, you would not be able to renege on </span>the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that you have exploited me, <span class="gemarra-regular">can you renege on </span>the sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>If the seller sold him <span class="gemarra-regular">bad </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">good, the seller can renege on </span>the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the buyer.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is </span>all already taught in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> were derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mishna </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>in the cases brought <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rav Ḥisda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both </span>the buyer and the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">are able to renege on </span>the sale. The reason is that this is a case of exploitation, as the item was sold for more than its value, and therefore as long the buyer can renege on the sale, the sale is not complete. Consequently, as the seller lost out as well, he can also renege on the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to teach us that </span>if the seller said that he is selling good wheat and it is found to be bad, <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer can renege on </span>the sale, as this is considered a case of exploitation.
It is necessary to teach this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that this is not a case of exploitation <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written: “It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer;</span> but when he is gone his way, then he boasts” (Proverbs 20:14). In other words, it is the usual manner of sellers to praise their merchandise, while buyers disparage it. Therefore, the mishna teaches that the buyer can renege on the sale if the item was found to be bad, and the seller can change his mind if it was found to be good.
§ The mishna teaches that if the seller said that he was selling <span class="gemarra-regular">reddish-brown [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥamtit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">white, </span>both the seller and the buyer can renege on the sale. The Gemara assumes that <span class="it-text">sheḥamtit</span> means the color of the sun [<span class="it-text">ḥama</span>]. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: White</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in contrast to <span class="it-text">sheḥamtit</span>, and there are two types of wheat, one white and the other red, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">this sun is red</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not white. <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it reddens in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning and evening. And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not see </span>the red color <span class="gemarra-regular">all day </span>is because <span class="gemarra-regular">our eyesight is not strong </span>and we cannot discern the redness of the sun.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this claim: With regard to a verse that speaks of leprosy: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin” </span>(Leviticus 13:30), the Sages explain: This means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the appearance of the sun, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">deeper than the shadow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But there, </span>leprosy <span class="gemarra-regular">is white </span>and yet it is likened to the sun. The Gemara answers: There, it means that it <span class="gemarra-regular">has an appearance like the sun </span>in certain respects, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like the appearance of the sun </span>in all respects. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the appearance of the sun </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">deeper than the shadow, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">like the appearance of the sun, as there </span>the leprous spot is <span class="gemarra-regular">white, and here </span>the sun is <span class="gemarra-regular">red.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to that which entered our mind initially, </span>that the sun is white, doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">it redden in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning and evening? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the morning </span>it becomes red <span class="gemarra-regular">as it passes over the site of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">roses of the Garden of Eden, </span>whose reflections give the light a red hue. <span class="gemarra-regular">In the evening </span>the sun turns red <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">passes over the entrance of Gehenna, </span>whose fires redden the light. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say the opposite </span>in explaining why the sun is red in the morning and the evening, i.e., in the morning it passes over the entrance of Gehenna, while in the evening it passes over the site of the roses of the Garden of Eden.
§ The mishna teaches: If the seller sold <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, both </span>the seller and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">can renege on </span>the sale. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 84b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Wine and vinega</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are one type </span>of food, which means that if, for example, one separated <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from one of these with the intention that it should exempt the other, his action is effective. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">two types </span>of food. Apparently, the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gem ara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishn a is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to </span>the issue of whether one can separate <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> from wine to redeem vinegar and vice versa. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Rabbis hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ela says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from poor</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>produce, i.e., in order to fulfill the obligation of separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from the high-quality produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">that his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> is valid <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is stated: “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing as you have set apart from it its best” </span>(Numbers 18:32).
The verse is understood as indicating that one who sets aside inferior produce has sinned. It also demonstrates that if one did, in fact, set aside <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from poor-quality produce in order to render permitted superior-quality produce, his action is effective and the inferior produce is sanctified as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the inferior produce <span class="gemarra-regular">is not consecrated, why </span>would one <span class="gemarra-regular">bear a sin? </span>It should be considered as though he did nothing. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from poor</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality</span> produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> is valid <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Rabbis agree and hold that in the case of one who separates vinegar in order to redeem wine, his <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is valid despite the difference in quality, as wine and vinegar are considered a single type of food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to buying and selling, everyone, </span>including the Rabbis, agrees that wine and vinegar are two types of food, as they have different uses. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom wine is preferable and vinegar is not preferable, and there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom vinegar is preferabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wine is not preferable.</span>
mishna This mishna discusses several methods of acquiring movable property. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to another, </span>if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not measure </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>the produce through the act of acquisition of pulling. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he measured </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not pull </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired </span>it, and either the seller or the buyer can decide to rescind the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">is perspicacious </span>and wants to acquire the produce without having to pull it, and he wishes to do so before the seller could change his mind and decide not to sell, <span class="gemarra-regular">he rents its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where the produce is located, and his property immediately effects acquisition of the produce on his behalf.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who buys flax from another, </span>because flax is usually carried around <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until he carries i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from place to place </span>and acquires it by means of the act of acquisition of lifting. Pulling the flax is ineffective. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it was attached to the ground, and he detached any amount, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it, as the Gemara will explain.
gemara The mishna mentions several modes of acquisition without elaboration. It does not explain in which domain the act takes place, whether on the property of the seller or in the public domain. Likewise, it does not specify who performs these actions. The Gemara clarifies these details. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is not the public domain but a location where people can keep their belongings, then even if the buyer did not pull the produce, he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Perhaps my teacher heard </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to one who measures into his basket</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that of the buyer, in which case his possessions effect acquisition of the produce for him. But if the produce is placed on the floor of the alleyway, the buyer does not acquire the produce. Rabbi Asi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This one of the Sages, </span>i.e., Rabbi Zeira, <span class="gemarra-regular">seems like one who has not studied </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">into the basket </span>of the buyer, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that he acquires it? If an item is placed in the buyer’s basket it is clearly acquired by him, regardless of the location of the basket. Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to an alleyway must be referring to items placed on the floor of the alleyway.
The Gemara asks: Did Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>this claim <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>Rabbi Asi, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">he not accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him? </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yannai say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard belonging to partners, </span>which is similar in status to an alleyway, the partners <span class="gemarra-regular">acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one another. What, is it not </span>correct to say that there is no difference between placing items on the ground and in their basket, as a partner acquires an item even when it is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the ground, </span>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Asi? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is referring to a case where the item is measured <span class="gemarra-regular">into the basket </span>of the buyer.
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, too, </span>Rabbi Zeira’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable, as Rabbi Ya’akov says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">measured and placed </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">has not acquired </span>it. Apparently, these two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> cited in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">are difficult, </span>as they contradict <span class="gemarra-regular">each other, </span>since earlier it was stated that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the buyer can acquire an item in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this apparent contradiction that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>i.e., in the statement cited by Rabbi Asi, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who measures into the baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of the buyer, which effects acquisition; and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>i.e., in the statement of Rabbi Yaakov, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who measures onto the ground, </span>which does not effect acquisition. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that this is the case.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he measured </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not pull </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to one who did so <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway, </span>which indicates that placing produce on the ground of an alleyway does not effect acquisition, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Zeira? The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the mishna is referring to one who did so <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the first clause: </span>If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not measure </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>the produce. But <span class="gemarra-regular">does pulling in the public domain effect acquisition?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t Abaye and Rava both say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">passing effects acquisition in the public domain and in a courtyard that </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not belong to either of them; pulling effects acquisition </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway or in a courtyard that belongs to both of them, </span>but not in the public domain; <span class="gemarra-regular">and lifting effects acquisition in every place, </span>even in the seller’s domain? This demonstrates that pulling in the public domain does not effect acquisition.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is the meaning of the phrase: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he pulled </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is taught </span>in the mishna? It means that he pulled it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the public domain into an alleyway. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the latter clause: If </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">is perspicacious he rents its place, </span>i.e., where the produce is located. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the mishna is referring to a spot <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, from whom can he rent </span>the place where the produce is located? The Gemara answers: The latter clause is referring to a separate <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: And if </span>the produce is <span class="gemarra-regular">in a domain </span>that has <span class="gemarra-regular">an owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is perspicacious he rents the place </span>where the produce is located from the owner.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the manner in which an acquisition takes place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel both say: </span>

Daf 85a

<span class="gemarra-regular">A person’s vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effect acquisition </span>of any item placed inside them <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, in any plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in which they are situated, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both say: Even in the public domain, </span>one’s vessels effect acquisition of items placed in them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>These <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree: Here, </span>when Rav and Shmuel state that one’s vessel does not effect acquisition for him, they are speaking of a vessel placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain; there, </span>when Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish state that his vessel effects acquisition on his behalf, they are referring to a vessel located <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And why do they call </span>an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain? </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a private domain.</span>
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, too, it is reasonable </span>to interpret Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Abbahu says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A person’s vessels effect acquisition for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in any place where he has permissio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to keep them. </span>It can be inferred from here: In a location where <span class="gemarra-regular">he has permission </span>to keep them, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>his vessels effect acquisition for him. But in a place where <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have permission </span>to keep his vessels, they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effect acquisition for him, and one has permission to keep his vessels in an alleyway but not in the public domain. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>this statement that when Rabbi Yoḥanan referred to the public domain he meant an alleyway.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a difficulty from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four case</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to sellers, </span>i.e., four methods through which merchandise is acquired. When the seller measures merchandise for the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">before the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">has been filled </span>the merchandise in the vessel still belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the selle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and he can change his mind and cancel the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">has been fille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the merchandise belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the buyer. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said when the seller measures <span class="gemarra-regular">with a measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not belong to either of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But if the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to one of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the items of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>as they are placed in the measuring vessel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said when the seller measures the items <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them. But </span>if it happens <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">until he lifts </span>the measuring vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">or until he moves it out of the domain </span>of the seller. If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller accepts upon himself </span>to sell, the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer acquires </span>it. If the merchandise is located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">with whom it had been deposited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> to designate a place where the merchandise is to be stored for the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">or until </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">rents </span>from the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">the place </span>where the merchandise is situated.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches with regard to </span>a transaction in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them </span>that if the measuring vessel belonged to one of them, the buyer acquires the items of sale one by one as they are placed in the vessel. 

Daf 85b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stating that a buyer’s vessels effect acquisition of items on his behalf even <span class="gemarra-regular">in the actual public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which contradicts Rav Pappa’s explanation? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>not the actual public domain. The Gemara asks: How can this be what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that does not belong to either of them, </span>i.e., a location to which neither of them have any rights, whereas they both have some rights in an alleyway. Consequently, this must be referring to the actual public domain, not an alleyway.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A courtyard that does not belong to either of them? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>refers to shared property, specifically a courtyard shared by partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">which does not </span>belong to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely and does not </span>belong to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely, but rather </span>it is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of both of them. </span>Consequently, this courtyard is comparable to an alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet raises a dilemma before Rav Huna: </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels of the buyer </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of the seller, </span>does the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer acquire </span>the merchandise once it is placed in his vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You learned </span>the answer already in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 77a): A wife is divorced when her husband hands her a bill of divorce or places it in a manner that is considered equivalent to handing it to her, e.g., placing in her courtyard. Accordingly, if the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>the bill of divorce <span class="gemarra-regular">to her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into her lap or into her basket [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kaltah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> even if she was in her husband’s domain at that time. By the same token, even if the buyer’s vessels are in the domain of the seller, they effect acquisition of the sold items on his behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span>Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you resolved </span>Rav Sheshet’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>has already been <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred strikes of a hammer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uklei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">be’ukela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In their analysis of this mishna, the Sages have already inserted so many qualifications that it cannot be understood in a straightforward manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna in <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> applies only if <span class="gemarra-regular">her basket</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was hangin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from her </span>body, so that it is considered on her or in her hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says: </span>It is sufficient if <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>to her, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it is not hanging from her, </span>but resting on the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava says: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where her basket was placed between her thighs. </span>Although it is not hanging from her, since it is placed on her body it serves to acquire the bill of divorce on her behalf. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rabbi Ami, says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where her husband </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he is not particular about the place where the basket into which he placed the bill of divorce is located, as his entire courtyard is full of baskets, it is considered as though he expressly granted her the right to make use of its location.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The place of her lap, </span>i.e., the place within her husband’s property where she stands or sits, <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to her, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the place of her basket is acquired to her. Rava said: What is the reason </span>behind the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person, </span>including a husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not particular neither about the place of her lap nor about the place of her basket, </span>as she requires these areas and they do not take up much space. It is evident from all of these qualifications that one cannot infer a halakhic principle from here with regard to a buyer’s vessels in a seller’s domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, resolve </span>the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the merchandise was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of a seller, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">until he lifts </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or until he removes it from the domain </span>of the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to merchandise placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the vessels of the buyer, </span>which proves that the buyer’s vessels do not effect acquisition of the merchandise on his behalf when they are in the seller’s domain? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this does not serve as proof, as it is referring to merchandise placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the vessels of the seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is why the buyer must lift or pull the merchandise to acquire it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the vessels of the seller, </span>as currently understood, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the vessels of the seller. Say the latter clause: </span>If the merchandise was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of the buyer, once the seller accepts upon himself </span>to sell an item, <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer acquires </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>this is referring to merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">in the vessels of the seller, </span>as in the earlier clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does the buyer acquire </span>it? The Gemara answers: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, we come to </span>a different scenario, which involves <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessels of the buyer.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the clauses of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> are addressing different cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>was it stated <span class="gemarra-regular">without qualification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The normal </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">of things </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the house of the seller the vessels of the seller are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found, and in the house of the buyer the vessels of the buyer are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found. </span>In sum, the dilemma cannot be resolved from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one pulled his donkey drivers, </span>thereby dragging along with them the donkeys laden with goods, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise, if he pulled <span class="gemarra-regular">his laborers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who were carrying merchandise he wished to purchase, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he brought them into his house, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whether he fixed </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">before he measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether he measured before fixing </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">can renege on </span>the sale, provided that the merchandise has not been unloaded from the laborers or the donkeys. 

Daf 86a

But in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he unloade</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the merchandise from them <span class="gemarra-regular">and brought it into his house, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he fixed </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">before he measured </span>the merchandise, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">are no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">able to renege on </span>the sale. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he measured </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">before fixing </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are able to renege on </span>the sale. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the vessels of the seller </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer do not effect acquisition </span>of the merchandise for the seller, i.e., they do not prevent the buyer from acquiring the merchandise, one can derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessels of the buyer in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller do not effect acquisition </span>of the merchandise on his behalf <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The merchandise was not placed in the domain of the buyer in vessels belonging to the seller. Rather, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he emptied </span>the vessels onto the ground. Conversely, if the merchandise remains in the seller’s vessels, the buyer does not acquire it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava became angr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> with Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak at his rejection of Rava’s proof, and retorted: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: He emptied them? </span>No; <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches: He unloaded them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he kept the goods in vessels belonging to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi says: </span>This proof can be rejected by means of a different interpretation, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not refer to vessels full of goods but is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to bundles of garli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> that were tied together. Therefore, they are unloaded straight onto the floor in the buyer’s domain.
With regard to the matter itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, son of Mar Zutra, said to Ravina: Since </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: He unloaded them, </span>which indicates that unloading the merchandise constitutes the act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he fixed </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not fix </span>a price? Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he fixed </span>a price <span class="gemarra-regular">he has made up his min</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to sell, and therefore the transaction can take place. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not fix </span>a price, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not made up his mind</span> to sell and the transaction does not occur. In any event, no convincing proof has been found with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where the vessels of the buyer are in the domain of the seller.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav and Shmuel both say: A person’s vessel effects acquisition for him </span>of any item placed inside it, <span class="gemarra-regular">in any place </span>that it is situated. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is added </span>by the phrase: In any place? Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">domain of the seller? </span>Rav Ashi answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring to a specific case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it. In that situation, the buyer does acquire the merchandise. This does not refer to a standard case where the buyer’s vessels are located in the domain of the seller.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that is guaranteed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, or by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill, or by taking possession </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have a guarantee, </span>i.e., movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired only by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling. In Sura they taught this </span>following <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rav Ḥisda, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in Pumbedita they taught it in the name of Rav Kahana, and some say in the name of Rava: They taught </span>that movable property is acquired by means of pulling <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">items that are not typically lifte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> due to their weight or for some other reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">items that are typically lifted, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>they are acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting, </span>but they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye sat and related this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Adda bar Mattana raised an objection to Abaye </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals a purse on Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for theft. Based on the principle that one who is liable to receive two punishments receives only the greater of the two, in this case one might think that he should be exempt from paying for the theft, as the performance of a prohibited labor on Shabbat is punishable by death. The reason he is liable in this case, in apparent contradiction to that principle, is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he already became liable for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>as soon as he lifted the purse. This occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">before he came to </span>violate <span class="gemarra-regular">the prohibition </span>of performing prohibited labor on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>by carrying the purse into the public domain.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If he did not lift the purse but <span class="gemarra-regular">was dragging </span>it on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and exiting </span>the private domain, continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">dragging and exiting, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as the prohibition </span>of performing labor on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>are violated <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously </span>the moment he drags the purse out of the owner’s property into the public domain. Therefore, he receives only the greater punishment, death, for carrying on Shabbat.
Rav Adda bar Mattana explains his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But a purse is an item that can be lifted, and even so </span>it is apparent from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling. </span>How then can it be stated that items that are typically lifted are not acquired by pulling? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the thief pulled the purse <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope. </span>Rav Adda bar Mattana thought that Abaye meant that the thief happened to drag it with a rope, and he responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">I also state </span>my question even in a case where he pulled the purse <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope, </span>as it is still evident that one can acquire the purse by means of pulling instead of lifting. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I meant that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that requires a rope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is a purse that is so large that it cannot be lifted and must be pulled, therefore it is acquired by means of pulling.
The Gemara raises another objection. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>If the merchandise is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">until he lifts it or until he removes it from the domain </span>of the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that can be lifted, if he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires he acquires it by lifting, and if he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires he acquires it by pulling. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>This is not a proof, as it can be explained that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches it disjunctively, </span>i.e., the two options are referring to two different cases: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that can be lifted, </span>he acquires it <span class="gemarra-regular">by lifting, </span>whereas with regard to regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that can be pulled, </span>he acquires it <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling. </span>

Daf 86b

The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna (84b) that even items that are usually lifted can be acquired by means of pulling: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to another, </span>if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not measure </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>it. The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But produce can be lifted, and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that it is acquired by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling.</span>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with large bundle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are pulled from place to place and are not carried, due to their size. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who buys fla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from another has not acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until he carries it from this place to another place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is acquired only though lifting and not through pulling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">flax is not prepared in large bundles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: Yes, <span class="gemarra-regular">flax is different. </span>Unlike other produce, flax is not packed in large bundles, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">sli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> from its place. Rather, it is packed in small bundles, and therefore flax is acquired specifically through lifting.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 25b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Large domesticated animals are acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through passing </span>the animal’s leash to the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and small </span>domesticated animals are acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through lifting; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. And the Rabbis say: Small domesticated animals </span>are acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through pulling. </span>Ravina explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But small domesticated animals are </span>creatures <span class="gemarra-regular">that can be lifted, and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">through pulling. </span>Rav Ashi rejected this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Domesticated animals are different, as they clin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to the ground and it is difficult to lift them. Therefore, the usual manner of moving animals is to pull them.
§ The Gemara cites another case with regard to sales. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel both say: </span>If a seller said to a buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a measure equivalent to thirty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">can renege on </span>the sale as long as the measuring vessel is not filled, <span class="gemarra-regular">even when </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> has yet to be measured, because he had agreed to sell only a complete <span class="it-text">kor</span>. By contrast, if the seller said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for thirty </span><span class="it-text">sel</span><span class="it-text">a</span> and each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he cannot completely renege on the sale in the middle of the transaction. This is because the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>as it is measured, since the seller sold each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> individually.
The Gemara raises a difficulty from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited on 85a. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: If the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to one of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the items of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one. And </span>since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated in general terms, it indicates that the buyer acquires each item as it is placed in the measuring vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">was not filled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a liquid measure equivalent to twelve <span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for twelve </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>each <span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>an observation <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Kahana says: </span>In the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">there were markings on the </span>vessel that measured <span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with which one could measure the different libations. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, there were marking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measuring </span>vessels, and since the measuring vessel indicates at which point each <span class="it-text">log</span> had been filled, the buyer acquires it. This is comparable to the case of one who sells each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> individually.
The Gemara raises another difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: One who hires a labore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the winter or the spring <span class="gemarra-regular">to work for him in the harvest, for </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar a day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 87a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a day of a laborer’s work during the <span class="gemarra-regular">harvest is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worth a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the equivalent of four silver dinars, for each day, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one may not employ the laborer under these conditions. The reason is that this is akin to taking interest, as the laborer works and receives less than he is entitled to in exchange for early payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if one hires him </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">from now </span>to work <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a day </span>for an extended period of time, including the harvest season, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the work of a laborer during the <span class="gemarra-regular">harvest is worth a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind, </span>as Rav and Shmuel claim, that if a seller said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he cannot fully renege on the sale in the middle of the transaction, as the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>as it is measured, then the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case should be different. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>as he does not agree to one large sum but <span class="gemarra-regular">fixes </span>a price for each day, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>it is akin to taking interest, as the laborer works and receives less than he is entitled to in exchange for early payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from him. </span>Whereas the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: If one hires him from now to work <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar a da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> over an extended period of time, including the harvest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one day of a laborer’s work during the <span class="gemarra-regular">harvest </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. Why </span>is it permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it payment for waiting, </span>i.e., for advancing the money to the laborer?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in that manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it prohibited </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">to lower </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hiring </span>price and receive lower wages in order to ensure that he is employed? This arrangement is not a form of interest and violates no prohibition. The Gemara asks: If this is not considered taking interest, then <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>where the laborer is not employed immediately and this arrangement is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>where it is permitted?
The Gemara explains: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, as </span>the laborer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not work with him from now, it has the appearance of payment for waiting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., advancing the money to the laborer. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, as </span>the laborer <span class="gemarra-regular">works with him from now, it does not have the appearance of payment for waiting.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the flax <span class="gemarra-regular">was attached to the ground and he detached any amount, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it. The Gemara asks: Is it correct to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he detache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any amount, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it? If he does not perform an act of acquisition with all of the flax, how can he acquire all of it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">clear for yourself any amount of land, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire everything that is on it. </span>When the buyer clears the land by detaching the flax from the ground, he is considered to be renting the land and thereby acquires all the flax that grows on it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells </span>food or drink that has an established price, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and oil, to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the price <span class="gemarra-regular">rises or falls </span>and the buyer or the seller wishes to renege on the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the price changed <span class="gemarra-regular">before the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is filled, </span>the merchandise still belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the seller </span>and he can cancel the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is filled </span>the merchandise belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the buyer, </span>and the seller can no longer cancel the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there was a middleman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sarsur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel </span>belonging to the middleman, being used to measure the merchandise, <span class="gemarra-regular">broke </span>during the transaction and the merchandise is ruined, <span class="gemarra-regular">it broke for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middleman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he is responsible for the ruined merchandise.
The mishna teaches an additional <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to sales: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>anyone who sells wine, oil, or similar liquids is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated, </span>after he transfers the liquid into the buyer’s vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">to drip for him three </span>extra <span class="gemarra-regular">drop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the measure. After he drips those three drops, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he turned </span>the barrel on its side <span class="gemarra-regular">and drained </span>out the last bits of liquid that it contained, this <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the seller </span>and he is not required to give these last drops to the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a storekeeper is not obligate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to drip three drops, </span>because he is too busy to do this constantly. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If the sale occurs on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat eve as nightfall </span>arrives, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from dripping these three drops, as there is a need to complete the transaction before Shabbat begins.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the mishna’s statement that the sale occurs once the measuring vessel is filled. <span class="gemarra-regular">This measuring </span>vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">to whom </span>does it belong? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">measuring </span>vessel belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the buyer, </span>why does the mishna teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">before the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is filled </span>the merchandise still belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the seller? </span>Since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">of the buyer, </span>he should acquire everything that is placed in his vessel, whether or not it is filled. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if we say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">measuring </span>vessel belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the seller, </span>why does the mishna teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">once the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is filled </span>the merchandise belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the buyer? </span>Since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the measuring </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">of the seller, </span>the merchandise has yet to enter the possession of the buyer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ela says: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measuring </span>vessel belongs to the <span class="gemarra-regular">middleman. </span>The middleman lends it to the seller, and once it is filled it is loaned to the buyer so that he can transfer its contents into his vessels. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause teaches: And if there was a middleman between them </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel broke, it broke for the middleman, it may be inferred that </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause we are not dealing with a middleman. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause </span>addresses <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measuring </span>vessel belonging to a middleman <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>the presence of the <span class="gemarra-regular">middleman </span>at the transaction, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>is concerned <span class="gemarra-regular">with a middleman himself, </span>who is present at the sale and therefore accepts responsibility for the barrel and its contents.
§ The mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he turned </span>the barrel on its side <span class="gemarra-regular">and drained </span>out the last bits of liquid within it, this liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the seller. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Elazar ascended </span>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he found Ze’eiri</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Who here </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to whom Rav taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">measures? </span>Ze’eiri <span class="gemarra-regular">showed him Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi. </span>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is it about this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for you? </span>Rabbi Elazar said to him that the problem is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we learned </span>in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he turned </span>the barrel on its side <span class="gemarra-regular">and drained </span>out the last bits of liquid within it, that liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the seller. </span>

Daf 87b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 11:8): If one poured oil or wine of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from one vessel to another and <span class="gemarra-regular">turned </span>the vessel on its side <span class="gemarra-regular">and drained </span>out the last bits of liquid inside, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> and must be given to the priest? This indicates that the last remnants of the liquid in the vessel belong to the one who receives the oil or wine, not the owner, i.e., the seller. Why, then, does the mishna here teach that the last remnants belong to the seller?
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated with regard to that </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says: Due to </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who relinquishes his right to such a small amount of wine or oil, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">touched upon it </span>and ruled that any remnants extracted from the vessel belong to the seller? By contrast, with regard to <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, which is forbidden to non-priests, the despair of the buyer is irrelevant, and therefore anything that remains in the vessels is <span class="it-text">teruma</span>.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a storekeeper is not obligated to drip </span>three drops. Rabbi Yehuda says: If the sale occurs on Shabbat eve as nightfall arrives, one is exempt from dripping these three drops. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first claus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if so his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is lenient, </span>as the mishna states that one must drip three drops and he states that on Shabbat eve one is exempt from doing so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he is referring to the latter clause and is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stringent, </span>as the mishna teaches that a storekeeper is always exempt, whereas Rabbi Yehuda rules that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only on Shabbat eve?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of this dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: On Shabbat eve at nightfall a storekeeper is exempt because </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">storekeeper is busy. </span>This proves that Rabbi Yehuda was referring to the latter clause of the mishna, i.e., he exempts the storekeeper from dripping the drops only on Shabbat eve.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to a storekeeper with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pundeyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a coin worth two <span class="it-text">issar</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">measured oil for him for </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">issa</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave him the </span>second <span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span> as change, and the son <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the jug and lost the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the storekeeper </span>must compensate the father, as he gave the jug and coin to one who is not halakhically competent. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda exempts </span>him from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he holds that the father <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>i.e., to bring back the jug and coin. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yehuda </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when the jug is in the hand of the child and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">storekeeper measured </span>the oil <span class="gemarra-regular">into it that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>if the child breaks the jug.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oil, </span>one can explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree over this </span>matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Rabbis hold </span>that the father <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">to inform </span>the storekeeper that he needed oil but did not intend for the storekeeper to send the oil with the boy. For this reason, if the storekeeper gave the child the oil he is liable for its loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sent </span>his son so that the storekeeper would <span class="gemarra-regular">send him </span>back with the oil, and therefore the storekeeper is exempt from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the child <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the jug, </span>why do the Rabbis hold that the storekeeper is responsible for it? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a deliberate loss </span>on the part of the father, as he entrusted the jug to his young son, who is not responsible enough to care for it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya said: Here we are dealing with a proprietor who sells jugs, </span>and the father sent his son with a jug in case the store owner might want to buy it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the storekeeper took </span>the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to examine it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel. As Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes a vessel from a craftsman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to examine it </span>and buy it if he chooses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an accident occurred </span>while it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession </span>and it broke, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay restitution for the vessel. He has the halakhic status of a borrower, and therefore he bears financial responsibility for the loss.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel is </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Since Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the Rabbis, his opinion evidently differs from that of Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba and Rav Yosef both say </span>that the disagreement in the mishna should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing with a storekeeper who sells jugs, </span>and the father sent his son to buy from him a jug filled with oil. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda follows his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as explained above, that the father sent his son to bring back the merchandise, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis </span>follow <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span> line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>that the father sent the son to inform the storekeeper what he needed, but not to carry it back.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the last clause: The Rabbis conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabbi Yehuda </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when the jug was in the hand of the child, and the storekeeper measured </span>the oil <span class="gemarra-regular">into it, that the storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Why would the Rabbis rule that the storekeeper is exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">But you said </span>that the father <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>his son only <span class="gemarra-regular">to inform </span>the storekeeper of his order, but he did not intend for the storekeeper to give anything to his son. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin both say </span>that the disagreement in the mishna should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>

Daf 88a

The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the jug from the child in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to measure with i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>because he took it in his hands, he is liable in the event of an accident, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba. As Rabba says: </span>With regard to the obligation to return lost animals, even in a case where the finder is exempt from caring for the animal and returning it to its owner, e.g., if he is an elderly person and it is beneath his dignity, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he struck </span>the animal in order to lead it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he becomes obligated </span>to return <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>Likewise, the Rabbis here maintain that the storekeeper’s action renders him liable for the jug.
The Gemara asks: You can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that Rabba says </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to animals,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">taught them </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">take steps away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he worsened the situation, as he causes them to stray even further from their owner. Nevertheless, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this, </span>where the storekeeper took the jug from the child, <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the storekeeper is liable? The storekeeper’s action does not make it any more likely that the jug will break.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: I and the lion of the group explained it. And who is </span>this great Sage, referred to as a lion? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the explanation is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the jug from the child in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to measure with it for others, </span>without the knowledge of the father.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to a borrower </span>who takes an item <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered like any other <span class="gemarra-regular">borrower </span>and once he returns the jug to the child, he is no longer responsible for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that someone who borrows without the owner’s knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">is a robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and is obligated to return the item to its owner. Therefore, the storekeeper must pay for the jug that the child broke before it reached the father.
The Gemara returns to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes a vessel from a craftsman </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examine it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and an accident occurred </span>while it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession </span>and it broke, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay restitution for the vessel. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement</span> applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the monetary </span>value of the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is fixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because he examines the vessel merely to ensure there is nothing wrong with it, and it is assumed that if he finds no defect he will buy it.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who entered a butcher shop and lifted a thigh of meat </span>to examine it. <span class="gemarra-regular">While he was lifting it, a horseman came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">seized </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yeimar, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed him liable to pay its monetary </span>value to the seller, because it was seized from him after he had lifted it. The Gemara again notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter, </span>i.e., <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, applies only in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where the monetary </span>value of the item is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed, </span>and therefore lifting it is equivalent to finalizing the sale.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who brought pumpkins to </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pum Nahara. Everyone came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">took a pumpkin </span>with the intention of buying it, but had yet to pay for it. The seller was angry, and since he did not know from whom to demand payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>The pumpkins <span class="gemarra-regular">are hereby consecrate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Heaven.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They came before Rav Kahana </span>to inquire about the halakhic status of the pumpkins. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>This statement has no effect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a person cannot consecrate an item that is not his, </span>and since the buyers had lifted the pumpkins, they no longer belonged to the seller. Once again the Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter, </span>i.e., <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, applies only in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the item’s <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore lifting it is akin to finalizing the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the item’s <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value is <span class="gemarra-regular">not fixed, it remains in the jurisdiction of its owner, and </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did well, </span>i.e., was successful, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he consecrated </span>it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>wishes to <span class="gemarra-regular">buy vegetable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the market </span>and the seller is an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, i.e., one who is unreliable with regard to tithes, in which case the buyer is required to separate tithes after his purchase, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he selected </span>superior-quality vegetables from inferior-quality vegetables <span class="gemarra-regular">and place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> them to the side, as he was considering purchasing them, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he did this <span class="gemarra-regular">all day, </span>if he does not decide to buy the vegetables <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not acquire </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not become obligated in </span>separating <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he had determined to buy </span>the vegetables he selected, <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquires </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and becomes obligated in </span>separating <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes. </span>In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not possible </span>for him to decide to not buy the vegetables and <span class="gemarra-regular">to return </span>them to the seller in their present state, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they have already became obligated in tithes, and, </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not possible to tithe them </span>and return them to the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he would then lower their monetary </span>value. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>should he proceed? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>the produce, give the tithes to an appropriate recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>in exchange for the <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes </span>that he separated from it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">because one determined to buy </span>the produce, even though he says nothing and performs no act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquires </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and becomes obligated in tithes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Hoshaya said: Here, we are dealing with </span>a buyer who is <span class="gemarra-regular">God-fearing, such as Rav Safra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">himself fulfilled </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And speaks truth in his heart” </span>(Psalms 15:2). With regard to business matters Rav Safra considered himself bound by his thoughts at the time of negotiations, even if he did not express them verbally or perform any action (see <span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 24a). A person on the ethical level of Rav Safra acquires the produce and becomes obligated to separate tithes from the moment that he decides to buy it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A wholesaler [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hassiton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">must clean his measuring </span>vessels, which are used for measuring liquids such as oil and wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">once every thirty days, </span>because the residue of the liquids sticks to the measure and reduces its capacity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">homeowne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> who sells his goods must clean his measuring vessels only <span class="gemarra-regular">once every twelve months. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The matters are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reversed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In the case of one who is constantly using his vessels for selling merchandise the residue does not adhere to the measuring vessel, and therefore a wholesaler must clean his measures only once a year.

With regard to moist </span>items, which are likely to adhere to the measuring vessels. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to dry </span>goods, which do not adhere to the measuring vessels, one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not nee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to clean his measuring vessels. 

Daf 88b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>before adding the weights and merchandise the seller is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to let </span>the pans of the scale that will hold the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>an extra <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the buyer by adding a weight to that side. If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">weighed for him exactly, </span>i.e., with the scales equally balanced initially, instead of allowing the scales to tilt an extra handbreadth, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must give </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">additional amounts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">geirumin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-tenth in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquids </span>sold by weight, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-twentieth in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>goods.
The mishna continues to discuss the correct method of weighing: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place where they were accustome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to measure </span>merchandise in several stages <span class="gemarra-regular">with a small </span>measuring vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not measure </span>all the items at once <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>measuring vessel. In a place where they measure <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>measuring vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not measure with </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>measuring vessels. In a place where the custom is <span class="gemarra-regular">to leve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> the top of the measuring vessel to remove substances heaped above its edges, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not heap </span>it, and where the custom is <span class="gemarra-regular">to heap </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not level </span>it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>that the seller must initially let the scales tilt an extra handbreadth, <span class="gemarra-regular">derived? Reish Lakish said: </span>The source is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse states </span>that one should have: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A perfect and just [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzedek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] weight” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:15), which is interpreted as an instruction to the seller: <span class="gemarra-regular">Be righteous [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzaddek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with that which is yours and give it to </span>the buyer. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the latter clause: </span>If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">weighed for him exactly, he gives </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">additional amounts. But if letting </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>is obligatory <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, how can he </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>by weighing <span class="gemarra-regular">exactly?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is not obligatory to let the scales tilt, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where they are accustomed </span>to let the scales tilt an extra handbreadth. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish was stated, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to the latter clause: </span>If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">weighed for him exactly, he gives </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">additional amounts. From where is this matter </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “And just [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzedek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Be righteous [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzaddek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with that which is yours and give it to </span>the buyer. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>are the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional amounts </span>that are given? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquids, one-tenth of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litr</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., one-hundredth.
The mishna teaches that the seller adds <span class="gemarra-regular">one-tenth in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquids, and one-twentieth for dry </span>goods. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking? </span>Does he mean <span class="gemarra-regular">one-tenth in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquids for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>units <span class="gemarra-regular">of liquid, and </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">one-twentieth in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>goods <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>units <span class="gemarra-regular">of dry </span>goods, i.e., one four-hundredth? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>he means <span class="gemarra-regular">one-tenth for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>units <span class="gemarra-regular">of liquid, and </span>similarly one-tenth <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>units <span class="gemarra-regular">of dry </span>goods, i.e., one two- hundredth? The Gemara states that the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi says: The punishment for </span>using false <span class="gemarra-regular">measures is more severe than the punishment for </span>transgressing the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations. As </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, forbidden relations, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated with regard to them </span>a shortened term for the word “these”: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">El</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,”</span> in the verse: “For all these [<span class="it-text">el </span>] abominations” (Leviticus 18:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, false measures, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>an expanded term for the word “these”: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Elleh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>in the verse: “For all that do these [<span class="it-text">elleh</span>] things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 25:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where may it be inferred that this </span>expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">el</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> indicates that the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is severe, </span>based on which it is understood that the form this word takes indicates a level of severity? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And the mighty [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eilei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the land he took away” </span>(Ezekiel 17:13).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to forbidden relations isn’t it also written: </span>“For whosoever shall do any of <span class="gemarra-regular">these [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">elleh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>abominations” (Leviticus 18:29)? If so, why is the punishment for using false measures considered harsher? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>expression of “<span class="it-text">elleh</span>” (Leviticus 18:29) in the context of forbidden relations does not serve to emphasize its severity. Rather, it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>one who uses deception in <span class="gemarra-regular">measures from </span>the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">excision from the World-to-Come [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the punishment is in fact less severe, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the advantage, </span>i.e., the greater severity, in the case of false measures? The Gemara answers <span class="gemarra-regular">that there,</span> in the case of one who engages in forbidden relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has the possibility of repentance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But here, </span>in the case of one who uses false measures, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no possibility of repentanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> because he has no way of knowing whom he cheated, and is therefore unable to return the stolen money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Levi says: Robbing an ordinary </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is more severe than robbing the Most High, </span>i.e., taking consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>regular robber, the verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“sin” before “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> “If any one sin, and commit a trespass [<span class="it-text">me’ila</span>] against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one who misuses consecrated items, the verse states <span class="gemarra-italic">me’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before sin: </span>“If any one engages in misuse [<span class="it-text">timol</span> <span class="it-text">ma’al</span>] and sins unwittingly” (Leviticus 5:15).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Levi says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed the Jewish people with twenty-two, and cursed them with </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">eight. </span>Rabbi Levi explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He blessed them with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-two </span>letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the first letter, <span class="it-text">alef</span>, that begins the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] you </span>walk <span class="gemarra-regular">in My statutes” </span>(Leviticus 26:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">until “upright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">komemiyyut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 26:13), which ends with the letter <span class="it-text">tav</span>, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And He cursed them with eight </span>letters, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> that begins the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] you shall reject My statutes” </span>(Leviticus 26:15), <span class="gemarra-regular">until: “And My statutes were abhorred by their soul [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nafsham</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 26:43), which ends with the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>. There are eight letters in the Hebrew alphabet from the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> to the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>, inclusive.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And yet Moses, our teacher, </span>who is flesh and blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">blessed them with eight </span>letters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and cursed them with twenty-two. He blessed them with eight </span>letters, 

Daf 89a

<span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> that begins the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it shall come to pass [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], if you shall hearken diligently” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">until: “To serve them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’ovdam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:14), which ends with the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he cursed them with twenty-two </span>letters, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> that begins the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But it shall come to pass [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], if you will not hearken </span>to the voice of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 28:15), <span class="gemarra-regular">until: “And no man shall buy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">koneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:68). This verse ends with a letter <span class="it-text">heh</span>, which comes just before <span class="it-text">vav</span> in the alphabet. Starting with a <span class="it-text">vav</span> and ending with a <span class="it-text">heh</span> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where they were accustomed to measure with </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>measuring vessel, one may not measure with several small measuring vessels. In a place where the custom is to level the top of the measuring vessel to remove substances heaped above its edges, one may not heap it; and where they are accustomed to heap it, one may not level it. The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the ensuing <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not balance with precision; and one may not heap </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">with market inspectors [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ba’agardamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; three; and ten; fulcrum; weights; a thick leveler; you may not do; one may not do.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not leve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> a measuring vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where they </span>are accustomed to <span class="gemarra-regular">heap </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not heap </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where they </span>are accustomed to <span class="gemarra-regular">level </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “A perfect weight” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:15), which indicates that one must use whatever is considered a perfect measuring vessel in that locale, as this ensures that there is no deception or trickery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said in a place where they heap</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby levelin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>am willing in exchange <span class="gemarra-regular">to reduce the price for </span>you, or said, <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where they level: I am hereby heaping and </span>am willing <span class="gemarra-regular">to increase the price for </span>you, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall have” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:15). The addition of the term “just,” beyond the requirement that the weight be “perfect,” teaches that one must keep his weights in a just manner, i.e., that employed by the people of that locale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not </span>balance a scale so that it will <span class="gemarra-regular">balance with precision [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’ayyenin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place where they </span>are accustomed to <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>a handbreadth for the benefit of the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not let </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where they </span>are accustomed to <span class="gemarra-regular">balance with precision? The verse states: “A perfect weight” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the weight must be considered perfect in that locale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>a seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said, in a place where </span>it is the custom to <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>a handbreadth: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby balancing with precision</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>am willing <span class="gemarra-regular">to reduce the price for </span>the buyer; <span class="gemarra-regular">or, in a place where </span>it is the custom to <span class="gemarra-regular">balance with precision: I am hereby letting </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>a handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>am willing <span class="gemarra-regular">to increase the price for </span>the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight”</span> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the just way of acting is to weigh in accordance with the practice in that locale.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda of Sura says </span>a homiletic interpretation of the phrase: “You shall not have in your house diverse measures” (Deuteronomy 25:14): <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not have in your house” </span>means that you will become a pauper, who has nothing in his house. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that you used <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse measures, </span>buying with a large vessel and selling with a small one.
The phrase: “You shall not have in your purse diverse weights” (Deuteronomy 25:13), is interpreted in a similar fashion: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not have in your purse,” </span>i.e., you will become a pauper, who has nothing in his purse. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that you used <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse weights. But </span>if you possess only <span class="gemarra-regular">“a perfect and just weight,” </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall have” </span>wealth. Likewise, if you possess only <span class="gemarra-regular">“a perfect and just measure,” </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall have” </span>wealth.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not have,” teaches that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints market inspectors to </span>supervise the accuracy of <span class="gemarra-regular">measures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appoint market inspectors for </span>supervising market <span class="gemarra-regular">prices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The house of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nasi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appointed market inspectors for </span>supervising <span class="gemarra-regular">both measures and prices. Shmuel said to </span>his student, the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Karna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one appoints market inspectors for </span>supervising <span class="gemarra-regular">measures but one does not appoint market inspectors for prices.</span>
Karna <span class="gemarra-regular">went out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">taught them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one appoints market inspectors for </span>supervising <span class="gemarra-regular">both measures and prices. </span>Shmuel, hearing what he had done, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is your name? </span>He replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Karna. </span>Shmuel said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let a horn [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] emerge in his eye. A horn, </span>i.e., a growth of flesh, <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged in his eye. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Karna, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">did he hold, </span>which led him to disregard his teacher’s statement? He held <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with that which Rami bar Ḥama says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One appoints market inspectors for </span>supervising <span class="gemarra-regular">both measures and prices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to swindlers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to prevent people from using smaller measures or from selling at a steep price while falsely claiming that they are selling superior-quality merchandise.
The Gemara discusses several <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> related to the cases of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">requested from </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> of a specific item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he weighs for him </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> weight. If he asks for <span class="gemarra-regular">half a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he weighs for him using a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> weight. If he wants <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he weighs for him </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter</span>-<span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> weight. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this obvious? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>The Gemara explains: It teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that one sets weight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until this </span>amount, one-quarter of a <span class="it-text">litra</span>, but not less. If a buyer asks the seller to weigh a smaller amount for him, his request is not granted.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">requested from him three-quarters </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and there is no weight equal to this amount, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">may not say to him: Weigh for me three </span>units using <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">litr</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> weight, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>so that the seller lets the scales tilt by a handbreadth as he measures each quarter-<span class="it-text">litra</span> weight. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he weighs </span>the merchandise all at once, as he places <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> weight on one pan of the scale, and <span class="gemarra-regular">places </span>on the other pan of the scale <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> weight </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the meat </span>that is being sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>In a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">requested from </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> of merchandise, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">may not say to him: Weigh for me </span>each <span class="it-text">litra</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one, and let </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt </span>each time, as on every occasion that the seller does this the buyer receives more than that for which he paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he weighs all </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">at the same tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and lets </span>the scales <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt once for all </span>the merchandise.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: The fulcrum of a scal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> must be <span class="gemarra-regular">suspen-ded in the ai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> so that the point the lever goes through it is at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>from the ceiling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the pans of the scale must be <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths above the ground. And </span>the scale’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lever and cord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which each pan is suspended, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve handbreadths </span>long. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fulcrum of a scale <span class="gemarra-regular">of wool-weavers and glassmaker</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> must be <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended in the air </span>at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths </span>from the ceiling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the pans of the scale must be <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths above the ground. And its lever and cord </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">nine handbreadths </span>long.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fulcrum of a scale <span class="gemarra-regular">of a storekeeper and of a homeowne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> must be <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended in the air </span>at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth </span>from the ceiling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the pans of the scale must be <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth above the ground. And its lever and cord </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">six handbreadths long. And </span>the fulcrums of small <span class="gemarra-regular">scales [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">turtanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> used for weighing gold and silver must be <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended in the air </span>at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three fingerbreadths </span>from the ceiling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the pans of the scales must be <span class="gemarra-regular">three fingerbreadths above the ground. </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its lever and cord, I do not know </span>their required length.
Since the function of each type of balance scale is mentioned with the exception of the first type, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>large balance scale, which is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">first, for what </span>is it used? 

Daf 89b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>It is a balance scale <span class="gemarra-regular">for blacksmiths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who weigh heavy pieces of metal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish says: Just as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said with regard to the prohibition of </span>the scales that one may not use a scale that does not meet the criteria listed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to their ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, if the cords and pole are not attached in the proper manner, they are not susceptible to ritual impurity as part of the scale.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? We learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 29:5): With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">rope </span>from which the <span class="gemarra-regular">scales </span>are suspended, if the balance scale belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to a storekeeper or to homeowners </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth </span>in length for it to be susceptible to ritual impurity. Why, then, is the statement of Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish necessary? The Gemara answers: Although the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Kelim</span> discusses the rope from which the scales are suspended, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary for </span>Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish to mention the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the scale’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lever and cord, which we did not learn about </span>in that mishna.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not prepare weights of tin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ba’atz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor of lead, nor of a metal alloy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gisteron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor of any other types of metal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because all of these deteriorate over time and the buyer will ultimately pay for more merchandise than he receives. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>weights <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>hard <span class="gemarra-regular">rock and of glass.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: One may not prepare the leveler, </span>used to remove the excess from the mouth of a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a gourd, because it is a light </span>material and does not level effectively, thereby causing a loss for the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be made <span class="gemarra-regular">of metal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because it weighs dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and removes too much of the merchandise, leading to a loss for the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare it from </span>the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">of an olive</span> tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">or of a nut </span>tree, or <span class="gemarra-regular">of a sycamore </span>tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a boxwood </span>tree,which are of medium weight.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not prepare the leveler </span>in such a manner that <span class="gemarra-regular">one of its sides is thick and one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">side is thin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because in such a case the two sides will not level equally. Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not level all at once</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> by a single quick movement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as one who levels all at once </span>acts in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">bad for the seller and good for the buyer, </span>because he removes less of the excess than one who levels in the regular fashion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not level little by little, </span>i.e., with several slow movements, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">bad for the buyer and good for the seller.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said with regard to all </span>these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe to me if I say </span>them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">woe unto me if I do not say </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">If I say </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps swindlers will learn </span>new methods of cheating of which they were previously unaware. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if I do not say </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps swindlers will say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah scholars are not well versed in our handiwork. A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai decide to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> in public <span class="gemarra-regular">or did he not say </span>them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: He said them, and he said them on </span>the basis of <span class="gemarra-regular">this verse: “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just walk in them; but transgressors stumble over them” </span>(Hosea 14:10).
§ The Gemara further discusses weights and measures. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bammidda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], in weight, or in measure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvamesura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 19:35). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> defines these terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In measure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bammidda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">measuring land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in order to measure land in a just manner <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not measure for one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in the summe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> when the measuring rope has become dry and short, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for one </span>other individual <span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season, </span>when the measuring rope is wet and limp, and therefore stretches more. <span class="gemarra-regular">“In weight” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not cover his weight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as salt erodes the weights, causing a loss for the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or in measure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bamesura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not cause </span>liquid he is measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">to foa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> by pouring it speedily, as this results in a loss for the buyer, who receives less of the liquid than the amount for which he paid.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it can be inferred by means of an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">that if</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which is </span>a measure equivalent to merely <span class="gemarra-regular">one thirty-sixth of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the Torah was particular that </span>one must measure honestly, so too, <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one must be careful in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a third-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is twelve <span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one-sixteenth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a smaller unit, as defined below.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: It is prohibited for a person to keep in his house a measure </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">too small or too larg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> than its supposed volume or weight, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he does not measure with it but simply uses <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a chamber pot for urine. Rav Pappa said: We said </span>this prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to a place where </span>measures <span class="gemarra-regular">are not stamped </span>with the government’s seal, which confirms that the measure is accurate. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in a place where </span>the measures <span class="gemarra-regular">are stamped, if </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not see the seal he would not take </span>the merchandise. Since they could not be used dishonestly, one is permitted to utilize these measures for other purposes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in a place where </span>measures <span class="gemarra-regular">are not stamped as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we said </span>that it is prohibited to keep these measures in one’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where they do not inspec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> measures to see if they are fit for use. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they do inspect </span>measures, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so; </span>one is never permitted to keep incorrect measures in his house, as <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it happens </span>that one measures <span class="gemarra-regular">at twilight, </span>when people are hurried, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">it happens </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the merchandise despite the fact that it was measured with an incorrect measure. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not keep in his house a measure </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">too small or too large, even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is used as <span class="gemarra-regular">a chamber pot for urine. But he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>measures in accordance with the established format: Measurements of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is three <span class="it-text">kav</span> or one-half of a <span class="it-text">se’a</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is one and one-half <span class="it-text">kav</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is one-eighth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>

Daf 90a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And how much is an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth of a quarter </span>of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of liquid measures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is twelve <span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or six <span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a third</span>-<span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or four <span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>three <span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and a half</span>-<span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and an eighth-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and an eighth of an eighth-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this, </span>the last mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kortov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let one also prepare </span>a measure equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers that this measure is not used, lest people <span class="gemarra-regular">come to mistake it for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is three <span class="it-text">kav</span>. The Gemara observes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, people er</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> by <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third </span>of a measure. <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, one should also not prepare </span>a measure equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>people may <span class="gemarra-regular">come to mistake it for a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is equal to one and one-half <span class="it-text">kav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is the reason that one may not prepare a two-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> measure: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>people might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to mistake it for a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is equal to one and one-half <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
The Gemara again suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, people err </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter </span>of a measure. <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, one should also not prepare </span>measures of <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is one-sixteenth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is one-twentieth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. Since they differ by only one-fifth, there is a concern that people might mistake one measure for the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: People are well-versed in small measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and can distinguish between them.
The Gemara continues: If people err by one-quarter of a measure, then since one may prepare a measure equal to four <span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let one not prepare </span>a measure equal to three <span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>these measures <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages did not decree </span>that they not be used. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the Temple as well, let </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">decre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that they should not be used, in case the two measures are mistaken for each other. The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">priests </span>who serve in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">are vigilan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and would not commit this error.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>If the residents of a certain place want to change the standard of their measures and augment them by a certain fraction, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may not increase the measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, and </span>they may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>increase the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a coin </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth </span>of its previous value. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who profit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from his sales <span class="gemarra-regular">may not profit </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth. </span>The Gemara analyzes these statements. When Shmuel said: <span class="gemarra-regular">They may not increase the measures </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, what is the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>doing so causes market <span class="gemarra-regular">prices to rise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the same concern should apply to raising the prices by <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, </span>and therefore this should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>be allowed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you will say that the prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>concern for <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitation; </span>and they may increase the measures only by up to one-sixth, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that there will not be nullification of the transaction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the transaction is nullified only when the disparity is more than one-sixth of the value of the item. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rava say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that </span>is otherwise subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of exploitation, and it is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">by measure, or by weight, or by number</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if the disparity was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the measure of exploitation </span>in the transaction, the transaction is <span class="gemarra-regular">reversed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A disparity of one-sixth between the value of an item and its price constitutes exploitation only in cases where there is room for error in assessing the value of an item. In a case where the details of the item are easily quantifiable, any deviation from the designated quantity results in a nullification of the transaction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that there will not be a loss </span>suffered <span class="gemarra-regular">by the merchant, </span>who might not realize that a new standard was issued, and sell in accordance with the old standard. Since a merchant usually enjoys a profit of one-sixth of the value of an item, if the standard is not increased by more than this amount he will not suffer a loss, as at worst he will forfeit his profit margin.
This Gemara notes: This explanation is also difficult, since even if the aim is to ensure <span class="gemarra-regular">that there will not be a loss </span>for the merchant, <span class="gemarra-regular">does he not need </span>to earn <span class="gemarra-regular">a profit? </span>There is a well-known adage in this regard: If you <span class="gemarra-regular">buy and sell </span>without making any profit, <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">be called a merchant? </span>A merchant must profit from his sales; therefore, if this decree was instituted for the protection of merchants, the Sages should have ensured that they earn a profit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The prohibition is not based on logical reasoning. Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel found a vers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and interpreted it homiletically: “And the shekel shall be twenty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Ezekiel 45:12). According to this verse, the combination of all of these numbers, sixty shekels, is equivalent to a <span class="it-text">maneh</span>. 

Daf 90b

This is problematic: How can <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span> consist of sixty shekels? Since each biblical shekel is equivalent to four dinars, if a <span class="it-text">maneh</span> is equal to sixty shekels, a <span class="it-text">maneh</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is two hundred and forty</span> dinars. But a <span class="it-text">maneh</span> is actually equal to twenty-five shekels, which is one hundred dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>matters: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was doubled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that it equaled fifty dinars, not twenty-five. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <span class="it-text">maneh</span> will be sixty dinars, not fifty, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that a community may <span class="gemarra-regular">increase measures, but they may not increase </span>them by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one-sixth </span>is calculated <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside, </span>i.e., it is one-sixth of the final sum, which is one-fifth of the previous sum.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa bar Shmuel instituted </span>a new <span class="gemarra-regular">measure of three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kefiza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is equal to three <span class="it-text">log</span>. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But doesn’t Shmuel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not increase the measures </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth? </span>You have added one-third, as there already exists a measure of a half-kav, which is the equivalent of two <span class="it-text">log</span>. Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I instituted a new measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the measure <span class="gemarra-regular">to Pumbedita, and they did not accept it; he sent it to </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Paphunya, and they accepted it and called it the measur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa.</span>
§ The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic </span>for the ensuing discussions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hoarders of produce; one may not hoard; and one may not export; and one may not earn </span>a profit; <span class="gemarra-regular">twice </span>from the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">of eggs; </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">sound the alarm; and one may not leave.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: Hoarders of produce, </span>who drive up prices by causing a shortage of available goods, <span class="gemarra-regular">and usurers, and those </span>sellers <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">measures, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and those who raise </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">price</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by selling for more than the accepted price, <span class="gemarra-regular">about them the verse states: </span>“You that would swallow the needy and destroy the poor of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell produce? And the Shabbat, that we may set forth grain? Making the measure small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances of deceit” </span>(Amos 8:4–5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their works” </span>(Amos 8:7).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hoarders of produce, such as whom? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Such as Shabbtai, the hoarder of produce, </span>who would buy and hoard large amounts of produce and later sell it at a high price.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s father would sell produce during </span>the period of the <span class="gemarra-regular">early </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">price</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when produce is cheap, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the early </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">price. His son Shmuel </span>acted differently, and <span class="gemarra-regular">would keep the produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sell it during </span>the period of the <span class="gemarra-regular">late </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">price, </span>when produce is expensive, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the early </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">price. They sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>Eretz Yisrael: The practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of the father is better than </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of the son. What is the reason </span>for this? A market <span class="gemarra-regular">price that </span>has been <span class="gemarra-regular">ease</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and starts out low will remain <span class="gemarra-regular">eased, </span>with little increase over the course of the year. Therefore, one who makes produce available at the beginning of the season, like Shmuel’s father, aids people during the entire year. By contrast, a market price that starts out high, because people are not making their produce available at the market, is not easily lowered.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: A person may turn his </span>own <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into a storeroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he may hoard the produce of his own field and sell it only at a later stage, without violating the prohibition of hoarding produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not hoar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">items that contain </span>an element of basic <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours, but </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">spices, </span>such as <span class="gemarra-regular">cumin and pepper, it is permitted. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who buys </span>that produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from the market </span>to resell later; <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to one who brings in </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span>own field, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>for any type of produce.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is permitted for a person to hoard produce in Eretz Yisrael </span>for these <span class="gemarra-regular">three years: The year preceding the Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the year that follows the Sabbatical </span>Year, because the land lies fallow during the seventh year, the Sabbatical Year, and the produce of the sixth year must last through these three years, until near the end of the eighth year.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And in years of drough</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not hoard even a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of carobs, because </span>he thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">brings a curse on </span>market <span class="gemarra-regular">prices, </span>as everyone is fearful of selling and even a small fluctuation in supply can cause a significant rise in prices. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>who was living in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to his servant Fuga: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hoard produce for me </span>for the coming <span class="gemarra-regular">three years</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The year preceding the Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the year that follows the Sabbatical </span>Year.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not export produce from Eretz Yisrae</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> if it consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">items that contain </span>an element of basic <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours, </span>because this causes them to become more expensive in Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira permits </span>export <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, because </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">lessens licentiousness </span>in Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as one may not export </span>these types of produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not export </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from Eretz Yisrael to Syria</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as Syria is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael in this context. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>the export of produce

Daf 91a

<span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the northernmost <span class="gemarra-regular">province [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mehiparkheya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the southernmost <span class="gemarra-regular">provinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of Syria.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not earn </span>a profit <span class="gemarra-regular">in Eretz Yisrae</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>buying and reselling <span class="gemarra-regular">items that contain </span>an element of basic <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours, </span>because this causes their price to rise. Rather, those who grow the produce should sell them in the markets, without recourse to a middleman.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said of Rabbi Elazar ben Azary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he would earn </span>a profit <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and oil. With regard to wine, he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>ben Beteira, who says that it is permitted to export wine from Eretz Yisrael despite the fact that this causes it to become more expensive, as drinking wine leads to licentiousness. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to oil, in Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s locale oil was common; </span>consequently, there was no concern that its price would rise if it were not sold directly to the consumer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not earn </span>a profit <span class="gemarra-regular">twice </span>from the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">of eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mari bar Mari said: Rav and Shmuel disagree </span>about the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said </span>it means that the seller may not charge <span class="gemarra-regular">doubl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the price he paid for the eggs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">merchant</span> may not sell <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">merchant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> rather, the merchant who buys from the owner of the eggs must sell directly to the consumer.
§ Apropos price fluctuations, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>A community <span class="gemarra-regular">sounds the alarm </span>and gathers in public prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">for merchandise </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">perakmatya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> whose price has dropped. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even on Shabbat </span>it is permitted to cry and plead, even though one may not pray for his personal needs on Shabbat, as this hardship affects the entire public.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring specifically to merchandise that serves as the basis of the local economy, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as linen garments in Babylonia, and wine and oil in Eretz Yisrael. Rav Yosef said: And that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that public prayer is recited even on Shabbat, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">was reduced in price and stood </span>at such prices that goods that had been worth <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>are currently selling <span class="gemarra-regular">for six</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not leave Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>live <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is double its usual price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: When </span>does this exception, permitting one to leave Eretz Yisrael under certain circumstances, apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when one is unable to find </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">to buy, </span>as he has no money. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when one </span>has money and <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to find </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">to buy, even </span>if the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he may not leave.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai would likewise say: Elimelech </span>and his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">Mahlon and Chilion were prominent </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">generation and were leaders of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">generation. And for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">were they punished? </span>They were punished <span class="gemarra-regular">because they left Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>go <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>concerning Naomi and Ruth: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: Is this Naomi?” </span>(Ruth 1:19). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Is this Naomi”? </span>How does this indicate that her husband and sons were punished for leaving Eretz Yisrael? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says </span>that the women <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Have you seen what befell Naomi, who left Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">for outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael? Not only did she not escape tribulations there, but she lost her status entirely.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>with regard to this passage: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">day when Ruth the Moabite came to Eretz Yisrael, the wife of Boaz died, </span>i.e., from the moment of their arrival the possibility was created for Ruth’s eventual marriage to Boaz. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explains the adage <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: Before the deceased dies, the person </span>who will next be <span class="gemarra-regular">in charge of his house arises</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as in this case Boaz’s new wife, Ruth, arrived as his previous wife died.
Apropos the story of Ruth the Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The judge <span class="gemarra-regular">Ibzan </span>of Bethlehem (see Judges 12:8–10) <span class="gemarra-regular">is Boaz. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he teaching us? </span>The Gemara explains that this comment is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the other </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna, as Rabba bar Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Boaz prepared one hundred and twenty feast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for his children </span>at their weddings. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated, </span>concerning Ibzan: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years” </span>(Judges 12:9). The verse indicates that he had sixty children.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And at each and every </span>wedding he prepared for his children, <span class="gemarra-regular">he made two feasts, one in the house of the father </span>of the groom <span class="gemarra-regular">and one in the house of the father-in-law </span>of the groom. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he did not invite Manoah, </span>the future father of Samson, whose wife was barren (see Judges 13:2) <span class="gemarra-regular">to any of them, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>It is not worth inviting him; he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a sterile mule, how will he pay me back? </span>Manoah will never invite me in return, as he has no children.
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: And all </span>of the children of Ibzan <span class="gemarra-regular">died during his lifetime. And this </span>explains the adage <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: Why do you </span>need the <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">that you beget during your lifetime? Go to the trouble and beget one who will be more diligent than sixty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This adage refers to Boaz, who had sixty children who died, and yet his last child, born from Ruth, is his glory, as King David was born from this line.
The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the ensuing statements that Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said that Rav said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Melech; Abraham; ten years; when he died; and He alone was exalted. Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Elimelech, and </span>Boaz’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Salmon, and So-and-so, </span>the unnamed relative who was a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz (Ruth 4:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Naomi’s father, all of these are descendants of Nahshon, son of Amminadab, </span>the head of the tribe of Judah (see Ruth 4:20–21 and Numbers 2:3). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he teaching us </span>by this statement? He is teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has the merit of his ancestor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to protect him, this merit <span class="gemarra-regular">does not stand for him when he leaves Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>go <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, as Elimelech died on account of this sin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: The mother of Abraham </span>was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Amatlai bat Karnevo. The mother of Haman </span>was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Amatlai bat Orevati. And your mnemonic,</span> to ensure that the two are not confused for one another, is that a raven [<span class="it-text">orev</span>] is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>and in this manner one remembers that Orevati is the grandmother of the <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>Haman, while a sheep [<span class="it-text">kar</span>] is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which indicates that Karnevo is the grandmother of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>Abraham.
Rav Ḥanan bar Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mother of David was named Natzvat bat Ada’el. The mother of Samson </span>was named <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzelelponit, and his sister </span>was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Nashyan. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>as to what their names were? The Gemara answers: It is important with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to an answer for heretics </span>who inquire into the names of these women, which are not stated in the Bible. One can reply that there is a tradition handed down concerning their names.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Our forefather Abraham was imprisoned </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">ten years, </span>because he rejected the idol worship that was accepted in his land. He was imprisoned for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Khuta, and seven </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">in Karddu. And Rav Dimi of Neharde’a teaches the opposite, </span>that he was imprisoned seven years in Khuta and three in Karddu. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: The small passag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Khuta, this is Ur of the Chaldeans </span>(see Genesis 11:31).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>On <span class="gemarra-regular">that day when our forefather Abraham left the world, the leaders of the nations of the world stood in a line, </span>in the manner of mourners, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: Woe to the world that has lost</span>

Daf 91b

<span class="gemarra-regular">its leader, and woe to the ship that has lost its captain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
With regard to leaders, the Gemara adds that it is stated in praise of God: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And You are exalted as head above all” </span>(I Chronicles 29:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Even </span>one with the most insignificant position of authority, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">an appointee over irrigation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is appointed by Heaven.</span>
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the punishment of Elimelech and his sons, which Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says they received because they left Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Heaven forfend </span>that they sinned in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>if Elimelech and his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">had found even bran they would not have left </span>Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, for what </span>reason were <span class="gemarra-regular">they punished? </span>They were punished <span class="gemarra-regular">because they should have requested mercy </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">for their generation, and they did not request </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “When you cry, let those you have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gathered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deliver you” </span>(Isaiah 57:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>that it is prohibited to leave Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">money is cheap, </span>i.e., not excessively difficult to obtain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and produce is expensive, </span>similar to the case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> where two <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of wheat are sold for a <span class="it-text">sela</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">money is expensive, </span>i.e., it is difficult to earn money for sustenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>Eretz Yisrael in order to survive.
The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the following list of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s recollections: <span class="gemarra-italic">Sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; laborer; carob; boy; they would say. </span>The first statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of produce <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">there were many swollen from hunger in Tiberias, as they did not have </span>even one <span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span> coin with which to purchase food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I remember when laborers would not </span>agree to <span class="gemarra-regular">work on the east </span>side of the <span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">they would die from the smell of the brea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that would waft over them from the city’s west side.
The Gemara continues to relate other, more salutary, memories: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when a child would break a carob, and a line of honey would extend over his two arms. And Rabbi Elazar said: I remember when a raven would take </span>a piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">meat, and a line of fat would extend from the top of the wall </span>upon which it was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the ground. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when a boy and girl, of sixteen and seventeen years of age, would walk </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">in the market, and they would not sin. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when they would say in the study hall that one who agrees with </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">falls into their hands, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that one who relies on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> sees that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">theirs.</span>
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the story of Ruth. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “Mahlon and Chilion” </span>(Ruth 1:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Joash and Saraph, </span>who had dominion in Moab” (I Chronicles 4:22). Apparently, both names refer to the same individuals who married Moabite wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagreed with regard to their true names. <span class="gemarra-regular">One says: Their </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">names were Mahlon and Chilion, and why were they called </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">names Saraph and Joash? </span>One was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Joash </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yoash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] because they despaired [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nitya’ashu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the redemption </span>of Eretz Yisrael, as they established themselves in Moab and lived there for many years. The other was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Saraph, because they were liable </span>to receive the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">burning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for </span>their sins against <span class="gemarra-regular">God, </span>because they left their community.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Their </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">names were Joash and Saraph, and why were they called </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">names Mahlon and Chilion? </span>One was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Mahlon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maḥlon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] because they made their bodies profane [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Chilion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">khilyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] because they were liable to </span>receive the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">destruction [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for </span>their sins against <span class="gemarra-regular">God.</span>
The Gemara notes: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">names were Mahlon and Chilion. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And Jokim, and the men of Cozeba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Joash, and Saraph, who had dominion in Moab, and Jashubi Lehem. And the matters are ancient” </span>(I Chronicles 4:22)? <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Jokim,” this </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua, who established [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ekim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and kept the <span class="gemarra-regular">oath with people of Gibeon </span>(see Joshua, chapter 9). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the men of Cozeba,” these are the men of Gibeon, who lied [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shekizevu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to Joshua </span>by saying that they came from a distant land. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Joash, and Saraph,” these are Mahlon and Chilion. And why were they called </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">names Joash and Saraph? </span>One was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Joash because they despaired [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shenitya’ashu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the redemption; </span>the other was called <span class="gemarra-regular">Saraph because they were liable </span>to receive the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">burning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for </span>their sins against <span class="gemarra-regular">God.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">“Who had dominion in Moab,” </span>this means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they married Moabite women. “And Jashubi Lehem,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ruth the Moabite, who returned [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheshava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and attached </span>herself <span class="gemarra-regular">to Bethlehem </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea. “And the matters are ancient,” </span>this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">these matters were said by the Ancient of Days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they occurred through God’s will, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “I have found David My servant”</span> (Psalms 89:21); <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the same term “found” also appears with regard to the daughters of Lot, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Your two daughters that are found </span>here” (Genesis 19:15). This teaches that David’s ancestry can be traced this far back, as he was destined to be born from Moab, who was the son of Lot’s daughter and Lot himself.
The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that analyzes the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“These were the potters, and those who dwelt among plantations and hedges; there they dwelt occupied in the king’s work” </span>(I Chronicles 4:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">“These were the potters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">otzerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” these are the sons of Jonadab, son of Rechab, who kept [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">natzeru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] their father’s oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">“Those who dwelt among plantations,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon, who in his kingship </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a plant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And hedges [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ugdera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” this </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanhedrin, which fenced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aderu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the breaches of the Jewish people </span>by means of ordinances. <span class="gemarra-regular">“There they dwelt occupied in the king’s work,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ruth the Moabite, who saw the kingship of Solomon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">grandson of her grandson. As it is stated </span>about Solomon: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother” </span>(I Kings 2:19), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar says: </span>This means <span class="gemarra-regular">for the mother of the </span>dynasty of <span class="gemarra-regular">kingship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Ruth.
§ Since the Gemara has discussed times of famine in Eretz Yisrael, it concludes the chapter with a blessing of times of prosperity: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall eat of the produce of the old store” </span>(Leviticus 25:22), referring to the produce grown in the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, this means <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-italic">salmanton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Without </span><span class="gemarra-italic">salmanton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Naḥman said: Without worms [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">retzinta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that consume the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Sheshet said: Without blight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which destroys the taste of the produce.
The Gemara notes: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheshet, </span>and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman. </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman: </span>From the verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you shall eat </span>of the produce of <span class="gemarra-regular">the old store, </span>until the ninth year” (Leviticus 25:22), one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jewish people will wait for the new </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">because the old store has </span>been <span class="gemarra-regular">destroyed. </span>Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “Until its produce comes in,” </span>to indicate that they will not stop eating the old produce <span class="gemarra-regular">until the </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">produce comes of itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., until it is fully ripe and they do not need the old produce. The old produce will last until then and will not become worm infested, as stated by Rav Naḥman.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheshet: </span>From the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall eat of the produce of the old store,” </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jewish people will wait for the new </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the old store because </span>the old store will have gone <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, </span>since blight will ruin the taste of the produce. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Until its produce comes in,” </span>which indicates that they will not stop eating the old produce <span class="gemarra-regular">until the </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">produce comes of itself, </span>as the stored produce will not suffer from blight.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>with regard to a verse in the chapter of the blessings stated to the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall eat old store long kept” </span>(Leviticus 26:10). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that any </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that is older than other </span>produce of that same type will be <span class="gemarra-regular">better than </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I have </span>derived that this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>it is the normal <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to age them. From where </span>do I derive in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the normal <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to age them, </span>e.g., fruit, that they too will improve with age? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Old store long kept,” </span>a general expression that indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case </span>the land will keep its produce from spoiling, as all types of produce will improve with age.
The continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall bring forth the old from before the new,” teaches that there will be storehouses full of old </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and threshing floors full of new </span>produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Jewish people will say: How will we </span>manage to <span class="gemarra-regular">take out this </span>produce from the storehouse <span class="gemarra-regular">before that </span>produce is brought in? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Everything </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">old is superior </span>in quality to the new, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for dates, liquor, and small fish, </span>which are better when they are fresh.


Daf 92a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">planted it and it did not sprout</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and even </span>if he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them, </span>i.e., he is not required to compensate the buyer. Since the buyer did not specify that he purchased the produce in order to plant it, the seller can claim that he assumed the buyer intended to eat it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>If he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> at all, then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they were certainly purchased for planting.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells an ox to another and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">one that habitually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gores</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: This is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mistaken transaction, </span>since the buyer can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for this function. Therefore, the seller must take back the ox and reimburse the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>The sale is not voided, as the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I sold it to you for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the fact that it gores is immaterial.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us see if </span>the buyer is <span class="gemarra-regular">a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">purchases </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for slaughter, </span>in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for slaughter, or if </span>he is a man who generally purchases oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing. </span>The Gemara answers: The dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">concerns a man who </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">purchases </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">for that </span>purpose, and so it is uncertain for which purpose he purchased this ox.
The Gemara persists: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us see the paymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> he made; <span class="gemarra-regular">how much was it? </span>Since an ox fit for plowing costs more than one fit only for slaughter, the purpose for which the ox was purchased will be apparent from the price paid.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to discuss the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the price of an ox to be slaughtered for its <span class="gemarra-regular">meat appreciated and reached </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of </span>an ox for <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing.</span> But if the price disparity is significant, there is no dispute. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>did they discuss the case? Even if the ox was not suitable for the buyer’s purposes, he could sell it for the same price of the ox he needs. The Gemara answers: The practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the effor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of selling the ox in order to recover its value; who must go to the effort of doing so?
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case under discussion? 

Daf 92b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>have sufficient funds for the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to be reimburse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by him, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">retain the ox </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">in lieu of his money, as people say: </span>If you wish to ensure that you will get paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">bran, </span>an inferior commodity, <span class="gemarra-regular">from one who is in your debt. </span>Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rav, the buyer will be likely to retain the ox. What, then, is the practical difference between the opinions of Rav and Shmuel?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to discuss the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does have </span>sufficient funds for the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to be reimbursed by him.</span>
The Gemara explains the logic of each opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: This is a mistaken transaction, </span>as in cases of uncertainty <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the majority, and </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of people <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase</span> oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing, </span>it is presumed that this buyer also purchased the ox for plowing. Accordingly, since the ox he received was not suitable for plowing, the sale is void. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: When we follow the majority, </span>that is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to ritual matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as this, we do <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> follow the majority. Accordingly, there is no basis for voiding the sale.
The Gemara cites <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>that indicates the topics of the cases it will reference to challenge either Rav’s or Shmuel’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woman, and slave, ox, oxen, and produce.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 15b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who was widowe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and is in dispute with her husband or his heirs over the value of the payment she should receive for her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she says: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">you married me </span>I was <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, </span>and so I am entitled to two hundred dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he says: That is not </span>the case; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">I married you, </span>you were <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow, </span>and so you are entitled to only one hundred dinars, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are witnesses that she went out </span>of her father’s house to her wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">with a veil [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hinnuma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>with the hair of <span class="gemarra-regular">her head loose, </span>in the typical manner of virgin brides, that is considered sufficient evidence in support of her claim, and so the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract is two hundred </span>dinars.
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that she receives two hundred dinars is <span class="gemarra-regular">that there are witnesses </span>to her claim. Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were no witnesses, </span>her claim would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be successful. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why? Let us say </span>that since there is an uncertainty, one should <span class="gemarra-regular">follow </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority of women, and </span>since the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority of women marry as virgins, </span>it should be presumed that this woman also married as a virgin. Accordingly she should be entitled to two hundred dinars. Since this is not the case, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>In this case, one cannot decide the case based on the majority of women <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that it is so that the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority of women marry as virgins and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a minority </span>marry <span class="gemarra-regular">as widows </span>or non-virgins. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it is also so that there is an additional presumption: The marriage of <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who marries </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin generates publicit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of that fact. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>woman, who is in a dispute over the value of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">because her </span>marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">did not generate publicity</span> of her marrying as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of women to her case <span class="gemarra-regular">is undermined. </span>Accordingly, there is no proof that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is really true that the marriage of <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who marries </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin generates publicity </span>of that fact, then even <span class="gemarra-regular">when there are witnesses </span>that she was a virgin bride, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">did not generate publicity </span>of her marrying as a virgin, perforce <span class="gemarra-regular">they are false witnesses.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must modify the above argument to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of marriages <span class="gemarra-regular">of women who marry </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">virgins generate publicity</span> of that fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">since her </span>marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">did not generate publicity </span>of her having been married as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of women to her case <span class="gemarra-regular">is undermined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rav’s opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a slave to another, and </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is found to be a thie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a gambler [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuvyustus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the buyer does not wish to have such a slave, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it has come to him, </span>i.e., the slave is acquired by the one who purchased him and the transaction is nonrefundable. By contrast, if the slave is found to be <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">listim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>has been judged and <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>to be executed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the govenment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the buyer can return the slave to the seller and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: That which is yours is before you; </span>return the money I paid for him, as the sale is void.
The Gemara explains the proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, 

Daf 93a

<span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that the sale is not considered to be a mistaken transaction? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because a majority </span>of slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are like this, </span>i.e., either thieves or gamblers? Apparently, the majority is followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is because <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are like this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Accordingly, no proof can be drawn as to whether we follow the majority in monetary matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 46a): In the case of an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that gored </span>and killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the cow’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fetus</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was found </span>dead <span class="gemarra-regular">at its side, and it is not known whether </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">calved before </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it </span>and the fetus’ death was unrelated to the goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether it calved after </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it </span>and the fetus died on account of the goring, the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the cow, </span>as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for an innocuous ox (see Exodus 21:35), <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-quarter </span>of the cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">for the offspring. </span>Since it is uncertain whether the ox caused the death of the fetus, its owner pays for half of the standard liability of half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara explains the proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why, </span>according to Rav, should he only pay for one-quarter of the damage to the fetus? Since there is an uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Follow </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority of cows, and </span>since the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority of cows become pregnant and calve </span>live offspring, one should conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>cow, which did not, <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly miscarried due to </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>it, and the ox’s owner should be liable for half the cost of the fetus. Since that line of reasoning is not applied here, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the reason that the ox’s owner pays for only one-quarter of the damage for the fetus is <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we are uncertain </span>about how it died, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span>possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">approached </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">from its front and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the cow’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fright, </span>not due to the goring, that <span class="gemarra-regular">it miscarried</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that the ox’s owner would not be liable; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>also possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">approached </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">from behind it and gored it, and </span>that is why the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">miscarried. </span>Accordingly, the payment for such damage constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">property of uncertain ownership, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">all property of uncertain ownership is divided </span>equally between the two parties.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this dispute between Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that was grazing and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">was found killed at its side, even though this </span>dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has been gored and that </span>grazing ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to goring, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has been bitten and that </span>grazing ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarned with regard to biting, </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is evident that this </span>grazing ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">or that </span>grazing ox <span class="gemarra-regular">bit it, </span>despite the fact such behavior is typical for the ox; rather, one cannot draw any definite conclusions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa says </span>that in the case of a rutting male <span class="gemarra-regular">camel that is rampagin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">camel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">camel </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">was found killed at its side, it is evident that this </span>rampaging camel <span class="gemarra-regular">killed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as such behavior is typical for a rutting camel. Therefore, the owner of that camel is liable.
Those who suggested the parallel between the tannaitic dispute and the dispute between Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed that a majority and </span>a logical <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>about whether an event will happen <span class="gemarra-regular">are equivalen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in their capacity to determine the facts of a case. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says </span>that one follows the majority in monetary matters, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa, </span>who follows a presumption to determine the facts of a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who says </span>that one does not follow the majority in monetary matters, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who does not follow a presumption.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I am stating </span>my ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that one cannot draw a definite conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in the case of the grazing ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we do not follow a presumption </span>in monetary matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he concedes that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the majorit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in monetary matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I am stating </span>my ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa says </span>that one can draw a definite conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in the case of the camels, <span class="gemarra-regular">since we follow a presumption </span>in monetary matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>this camel <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is presumed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> based on its behavior, to be the killer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he concedes that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not follow the majority </span>in deciding monetary matters.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rav’s opinion from the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to another </span>that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">planted it and it did not sprout, and even </span>if he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds, </span>which are rarely sold as food, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them.</span>
The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>novelty is indicated by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if he had sold flaxseeds? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>where he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds, of which the majority is purchased for planting, and </span>they were not suitable for that purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">nevertheless </span>the sale stands because <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not follow the majority </span>in monetary matters?
The Gemara concedes that the mishna cannot be reconciled with Rav’s opinion, but suggests that there are other <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> who hold in accordance with his opinion. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to another,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">planted it and it did not sprout, </span>if the produce was <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>If the produce was <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds, </span>which are only occasionally eaten, then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. Rabbi Yosei says: </span>

Daf 93b

The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">gives</span> back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the seeds. </span>Since the majority of flaxseeds are sold are for planting, it is a mistaken transaction. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him, </span>i.e., to Rabbi Yosei: <span class="gemarra-regular">Many, </span>i.e., a majority of people, <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>flaxseeds <span class="gemarra-regular">for purposes other </span>than planting. Consequently, the sale stands.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>are the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> who have a dispute that parallels the dispute between Rav and Shmuel? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and </span>the opinion cited as: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him, </span>that is incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them </span>hold that one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority </span>in monetary matters. Their dispute concerns only which majority to follow: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the opinion cited as: They said to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority of people </span>making purchases, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority </span>of the volume <span class="gemarra-regular">of seeds </span>that are sold overall. The disparity arises because the majority of sales are each made with a relatively small quantity of seeds that are purchased for purposes other than planting. The minority of sales involve large quantities of seeds that are purchased for planting. This means that the majority of the seeds sold overall are purchased for planting, but the majority of people purchasing seeds do so for purposes other than planting.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the dispute that parallels the dispute between Rav and Shmuel is <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yosei, or the </span>dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the opinion cited as: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the seller bears financial responsibility for selling seeds that did not sprout, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>he liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">give to </span>the buyer? He is liable to give him only the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the seeds </span>themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the expenses </span>that the buyer incurred in planting them, e.g., the hire of laborers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: </span>He is liable to give him <span class="gemarra-regular">even the expense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that the buyer incurred.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> whose opinion is cited as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥisda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: From <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>is it apparent that he holds the seller is liable for the buyer’s expenses? One possibility is <span class="gemarra-regular">if we say</span> that the statement in question is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel in the mishna, as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another produce </span>that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">planted it and it did not sprout, and even </span>if he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds, </span>which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>The Gemara extrapolates: By inference, if this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for them.</span>
The Gemara continues: But accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>If he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, then the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>The Gemara asks: But according to the inference made from the first clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also saying this, </span>as he holds that it is only for the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for them, </span>but with regard to the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>What, then, is the dispute between the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?
The Gemara therefore suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>that the differ-ence <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is whether the seller is liable for the buyer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the seller is liable only for the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the seller is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>for the buyer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it apparent that it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who holds that the seller is liable for the expenses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite, </span>i.e., it is the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who holds that the seller is liable for the expenses, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that he is liable only for the value of the seeds. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> cited <span class="gemarra-regular">always comes to add somethin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to the ruling of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, not to detract from it.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps all of </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>stating the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete, and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce to another </span>that is sometimes purchased for eating and sometimes for planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">planted it and it did not sprout, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he had sold <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds, </span>which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>But if he sold <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for them. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only for the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">flaxseeds that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">for them, </span>but by inference, for the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>plants, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not eaten </span>at all, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. </span>Interpreted in this way, there is no evidence from the mishna that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that the seller is liable for the expenses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the statement in question is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 10:9) In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who brought whea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to a miller <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind, and </span>the miller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not wet </span>the grains sufficiently for the grinding to be performed effectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he converted </span>the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">into bran or coarse bran [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mursan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or in a case of one who gave <span class="gemarra-regular">flour to the baker and </span>the baker <span class="gemarra-regular">made it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">underbaked </span>and tends to crumble, or if one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal to a butcher and </span>the butcher killed it in a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered it </span>an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass, </span>in all these cases the worker is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, because he is like a paid bailee.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>If the owner had invited guests to eat the food and due to the worker’s actions he was unable to serve them, then the worker must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him compensation for his humiliation and compensation for the humiliation of his guests.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And similarly, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say: There was a great custom in Jerusalem </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives </span>raw materials for <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal to another </span>to prepare the meal for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">spoils it, </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the former <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his humiliation and compensation for the humiliation of his guests.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Another great custom </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>followed <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem </span>was that when one made a feast, there would be <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over the entrance </span>to the hall. <span class="gemarra-regular">As long as the cloth was spread, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">guests would enter, </span>as the presence of the cloth indicated that there was food for more guests. When <span class="gemarra-regular">the cloth was removed, the guests would not enter </span>any more.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When selling a significant quantity of produce or a number of items, there is a possibility that there will be a certain proportion of impurities in it or that some of the product will be of substandard quality. The mishna delineates what proportion is considered acceptable, for which a buyer may not demand compensation. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells </span><span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, this </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>that up to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">ka</span><span class="it-text">v</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">impuritie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of produce purchased. When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he accepts upon himself </span>that up to <span class="gemarra-regular">ten infested </span>figs may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>figs purchased. When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">a cellar </span>containing barrels <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, he accepts upon himself </span>that up to <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>barrels of <span class="gemarra-regular">souring </span>wine may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>barrels purchased. When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs </span>of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sharon </span>region, <span class="gemarra-regular">he accepts upon himself </span>that up to <span class="gemarra-regular">ten inferior-quality jugs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pitasot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of wine may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>jugs purchased.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ketina taught: </span>When the mishna states that a buyer accepts upon himself that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> may be present, that means only that he accepts upon himself the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> legumes, </span>but he does not accept upon himself the presence of a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of dirt. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that the buyer does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>also accept upon himself that some quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt </span>might be present in the produce? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabba bar Ḥiyya Ketosfa’a say in the name of Rabba: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">picks out a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pebbl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wheat on <span class="gemarra-regular">another’s threshing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">floo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> 

Daf 94a

must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him the value of whea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of equal volume to the pebble that he removed. Had he not removed the pebble, the owner would have sold his wheat together with the pebble, all for the price of wheat. Accordingly, the removal of the pebble effectively caused the owner a small loss. It is apparent from this ruling that when selling produce, a buyer accepts upon himself that a quantity of dirt may be mixed in.
The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">legumes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one accepts <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt, </span>he accepts <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is so that he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accept <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells produce to another, </span>if he sells him <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of legumes </span>may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of wheat purchased. When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">barley, he accepts upon himself </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">chaf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> purchased. When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">lentils</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he accepts upon himself </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of dirt </span>may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> purchased.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that just as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rules with regard to lentils, <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true for wheat and for barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: No, <span class="gemarra-regular">lentils are different, because they are dug up </span>from the ground and dirt can easily get mixed in. Lentils often contain a higher percentage of dirt than do wheat and barley, which are harvested rather than dug up.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that a buyer accepts that dirt may be present in lentils but not in wheat and barley is <span class="gemarra-regular">that lentils are dug up </span>from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas wheat and barley </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and conclude that when purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley, </span>a buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept </span>that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt </span>may be present in each <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>perhaps when purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley </span>as well, a buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt </span>may be present in each <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary for </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> specifically with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">lentils. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>lentils <span class="gemarra-regular">are dug up </span>from the ground, the buyer would <span class="gemarra-regular">also accept </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of dirt. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: If </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to sif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the produce to check if there is more than the acceptable proportion of impurities and he finds that there is too much, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sifts all of it </span>and returns all the impurities to the seller, not just the amount in excess of a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. The seller must instead provide produce that is free of any impurities. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that this is the strict <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a penalty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that this is the strict <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives money </span>for produce <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for good-quality produce </span>containing no impurities at all. Even so, where there is just <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person will not take the troubl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to sift the grain to remove the impurities; instead, he accepts the small quantity of impurities that are present. By contrast, where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person will take the trouble </span>to sift the grain to remove the impurities, <span class="gemarra-regular">and once he takes the trouble </span>to sift the grain, he does not stop once he reduces the proportion of impurities to a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes the trouble </span>to sift <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it. </span>Accordingly, once he has sifted out the impurities, he never agrees to accept any quantity of impurities, and so the seller must take back all the impurities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a penalty. </span>They understand that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">usual </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities to be present in each <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span> of produce, and so it is presumed that a buyer accepts that quantity. <span class="gemarra-regular">More </span>than a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is unusual, and </span>consequently the seller is suspected of having deceitfully <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed </span>additional impurities into the produce that he sold. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>the seller deceitfully <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed </span>in impurities, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages penalized him </span>by requiring him to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the impurities present, even those which he did not add.
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the cases it will cite: <span class="gemarra-regular">All two documents of Ravin bar Rav Naḥman </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitation and a contract.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 2:1): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that contains a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> or more of seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">of a different kind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> before sowing such seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">one must reduc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the quantity of the other kind of seeds in the mixture so as not to violate the prohibition against growing a mixture of diverse kinds (see Leviticus 19:19). The Gemara explains: It can be <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed that </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of seeds of a different kind per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is as </span>problematic as <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a sale, as discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">here, and </span>therefore, since the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>with regard to diverse kinds only that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must reduce </span>the additional amount, but not that one is required to remove all the seeds of a different kind, it follows that the same is true in the case of a sale, and the seller should not have to take back all of the impurities. This contradicts Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara deflects the challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this assumption is not necessarily correct; perhaps the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of seeds of a different kind per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to diverse kinds is comparable to a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a sale, as discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and both are considered acceptable levels of admixture.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seeds of a different kind per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is acceptable, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the mishna teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must reduce </span>the quantity of seeds of a different kind? The Gemara answers: The requirement is a rabbinic decree <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the severity of </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds.</span>
The Gemara challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>

Daf 94b

<span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>It is insufficient to merely reduce the quantity of seeds of a different kind; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must pick out </span>all the seeds of a different kind.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seeds of a different kind per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> with regard to diverse kinds <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable to more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of impuritie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> with regard to a sale, then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">about this that they disagree: The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds that we do not penalize </span>one by requiring him to remove <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is permitted due to that which is prohibited, </span>and consequently it is sufficient to merely reduce the quantity of seeds of a different kind to an acceptable level, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">penalize </span>one by requiring him to remove that which is permitted due to that which is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seeds of a different kind per <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span> with regard to diverse kinds <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable to a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">ka</span><span class="it-text">v</span> of impurities per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> with regard to a sale, then <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does Rabbi Yosei rule that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must pick out </span>all the seeds of a different kind?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei: </span>One must pick out all the seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>once he is purifying the admixture of seeds, if he deliberately leaves a quantity of seeds of a different kind mixed in, <span class="gemarra-regular">it appears as though he is </span>intentionally planting and <span class="gemarra-regular">maintaining diverse kinds </span>in his field.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 37a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who deposite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> money <span class="gemarra-regular">with one </span>person, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and that </span>one deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, and when they return to collect their deposits, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: My </span>deposit was <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: My </span>deposit was <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">gives one hundred dinars to this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and one hundred dinars to that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the rest </span>of the money, i.e., the contested one hundred dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">will be placed </span>in a safe place <span class="gemarra-regular">until Elijah comes </span>and prophetically determines the truth. In this case, one of the parties is certainly lying, but nevertheless, the Sages did not penalize the parties by placing all of the money in a safe place. Similarly, in the case of a sale, where a seller deceitfully mixed additional impurities into the produce he sold, he should not be penalized and required to take back all of the impurities.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of the deposits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is certain </span>that at least <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master and one hundred dinars </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master. Here, </span>in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not mix in the entire </span>amount intentionally? Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a support for Rav Huna’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If so, what did the swindler lose? </span>He lost nothing by claiming the one hundred dinars that belongs to another, and he has no incentive to admit the truth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the entire </span>deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">will be placed </span>in a safe place <span class="gemarra-regular">until Elijah comes. </span>Since through his lie the swindler risks losing even the one hundred dinars that he deposited, perhaps that will induce him to admit his deceit. According to Rabbi Yosei, the Sages did penalize one who acts deceitfully, which accords with Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of the deposits, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is certainly a swindler, </span>and it is reasonable to penalize both parties in order to induce the swindler to admit his deceit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable level of impurities mixed in with the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that </span>the seller intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed in </span>anything? Perhaps the impurities were inadvertently mixed in during the processing. Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note in which </span>the details of a loan with <span class="gemarra-regular">interest </span>were written, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">penalizes </span>the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may collect neither the principal nor the interest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>According to Rabbi Meir, the Sages did penalize one who acts improperly, which accords with Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of a loan with interest, it is already <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the writing </span>of the bill that the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">performed the </span>transgression of <span class="gemarra-regular">placin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> interest upon the borrower. Since he certainly committed a transgression, it is reasonable that the Sages penalized him. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in with the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that </span>the seller intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed in </span>anything? Perhaps the impurities were inadvertently mixed in during the processing. Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a challenge to Rav Huna’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: He may collect the principal but may not collect the interest. </span>According to Rabbi Meir, the Sages did not penalize one who acts improperly, contrary to Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of a loan with interest, according to strict <span class="it-text">halakha</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly permitted </span>to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal, </span>so the Sages did not penalize him with regard to it. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not mix in the entire </span>amount intentionally? Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>further support for Rav Huna’s ruling from <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin bar Rav Naḥman teaches </span>(104b). Ravin bar Rav Naḥman’s statement is with regard to a situation when land that was sold is later found to be larger than stated at the time of the sale. If the deviation is not more than an area required to sow a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of land, then the buyer need not return any land to the seller. If the proportion of extra land is larger than this, <span class="gemarra-regular">not only must </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">return the extra </span>land that is beyond the limit of a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> area per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he must </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">return to him every one of the </span>extra <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> areas of land that he received beyond the stated area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, when one is required to return </span>part of a sale because of a discrepancy that is beyond the acceptable limit of deviation, then <span class="gemarra-regular">one is required to return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>discrepancy and not just the amount that is beyond the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span>

Daf 95a

<span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the sale of land, the reason the buyer may keep the extra land when it is less than the acceptable limit is that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I am selling you this piece of land <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it is </span>slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">less or </span>slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">mor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> than a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>, i.e., he agrees to accept a small deviation from the stated area. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>while an extra <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> area per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not significant, </span>and therefore the seller is willing to forgo it, <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> area per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is significant, </span>and the seller is not willing to forgo any of it. Consequently, all of the extra land must be returned. By contrast, in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the buyer is aware that it is normal to have a certain proportion of impurities mixed in and accepts this possibility from the outset. Accordingly, even if the proportion of impurities is greater than the acceptable limit, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities above the acceptable limit.
The Gemara explains why more than an area required to sow a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of land is significant: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that since </span>all those extra areas of land <span class="gemarra-regular">are fit to combine together to </span>form an area in which one could sow <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed, the extra land <span class="gemarra-regular">is a significant plot of land in its own right, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it must </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">be returned. </span>The land that was sold was stated to be a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>, which is thirty <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. If the area of the extra land was of a proportion somewhat more than an area required to sow a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of land, then thirty such areas would collectively be about equal to an area required to sow nine <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> of price <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is that if the disparity is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth </span>of the value of the merchandise, the <span class="gemarra-regular">merchandise is acquired </span>immediately and the sum of the exploitation need not be returned. If the disparity is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than one-sixth, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the transaction is nullified. </span>If the disparity is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, </span>the buyer has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the merchandise, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the one who benefited from the exploitation <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>the entire sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">exploitation.</span>
The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>in the case where the disparity is precisely one-sixth, is the entire sum of the exploitation returned? Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him return </span>only a small amount of the exploitation <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth. </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the fact that he must return the entire sum that <span class="gemarra-regular">when one is required to return </span>part of a sale because of a discrepancy that is beyond the acceptable limit of deviation, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is required to return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>discrepancy and not just the amount that is beyond the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of exploitation, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">initially said to </span>the buyer that he would sell the merchandise for a sum <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its value</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Any price difference should be unacceptable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>a disparity of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth is not recognizable in </span>a sale worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a person </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">forgo </span>it. By contrast, a disparity of <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered </span>significant, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a person will not forgo </span>it. Consequently, the entire sum of the exploitation must be returned. If the disparity is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than one-sixth, it is a mistaken transaction and the transaction is nullified. </span>By contrast, in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the buyer is aware that it is normal to have a certain proportion of impurities mixed in and accepted that possibility from the outset. Accordingly, even if the proportion of impurities was greater than the acceptable limit, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities above the acceptable limit.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When <span class="gemarra-regular">one receives a field from another </span>under a contract <span class="gemarra-regular">to plan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> trees in it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>field owner <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>that there may be <span class="gemarra-regular">ten deficient trees per </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> trees planted, as he is aware that not every tree planted will necessarily flourish. If the number of deficient trees is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than this, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon him </span>the responsibility to replace <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of those trees, and not only the number of trees above the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>There is no proof from this case, because <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>time there are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than this </span>number of deficient trees, the overall area that contains the deficient trees is of a size equivalent to a whole field. Therefore, the contractor is <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to one who comes to plant </span>a whole field <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who has not fulfilled his remit if he plants only a few trees; rather, he must plant the entire area. But in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the impurities never constitute an independent unit; consequently, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities that is above the acceptable limit.
§ The mishna teaches: When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">a cellar </span>containing barrels <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, </span>one accepts upon himself that up to ten barrels of souring wine may be present in each hundred barrels purchased. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling to you <span class="gemarra-regular">a wine cellar, with-out specification </span>of which cellar he meant, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as the Gemara will soon explain. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said to him: </span>I am selling to you <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he said to him: </span>I am selling to you <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>particular wine <span class="gemarra-regular">cellar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one said to a buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you a wine cellar, </span>then he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality, i.e., the buyer does not have to accept any quantity of souring wine. If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you this </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, </span>then he may <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>that is in his possession, even if it is of the quality <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sold in the shops</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is beginning to sour. If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you this</span> particular <span class="gemarra-regular">cellar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without mentioning the word: Wine, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">everything </span>he gives him is wine that had turned into <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, it has come to </span>the buyer and the sale is valid. The mishna’s ruling that the buyer must accept that up to ten percent of the wine might be souring does not accord with any of the rulings of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he said to </span>the buyer: I am selling to you <span class="gemarra-regular">a wine cellar, without specification</span> of which cellar he was selling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the following qualification <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first clause of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> that up to <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>barrels of <span class="gemarra-regular">souring </span>wine may be present <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>barrels purchased.
The Gemara challenges this addition: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he sold the buyer a wine cellar <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification </span>of which one he was selling, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>upon himself any souring wine at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One who sells a barrel of win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A barrel is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different, because </span>the wine inside <span class="gemarra-regular">is all one </span>body of <span class="gemarra-regular">win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the same quality.
The Gemara once again challenges the addition: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Zevid teach </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rabbi Oshaya: </span>If one says to a buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you a wine cellar, </span>then he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality? Similarly, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you this </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, </span>then he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality, but the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself ten souring </span>barrels <span class="gemarra-regular">per hundred </span>barrels. 

Daf 95b

Rav Zevid concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">storeroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the cellar, <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages taught in the mishna. </span>It is clear from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> both that it contradicts the suggested addition to the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and that the mishna concerns a case where one specified which wine cellar he was selling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>as indicated by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna also </span>concerns a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>particular cellar, and because he specified a particular cellar the buyer accepts upon himself the possibility that up to ten barrels per hundred might be sour.
Having retracted the addition to the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara asks: If so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>to reconcile the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which rules that if the seller specified that he was selling <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>cellar, he must provide wine that is all of good quality, with the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that of Rav Zevid, which rules with regard to the same case, in which the seller specified he was selling <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> cellar, that the buyer accepts that up to ten barrels per hundred may contain souring wine.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that he needs the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore he requires good-quality wine, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the buyer did <span class="gemarra-regular">not say to him </span>that he needs the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking. </span>The Gemara elaborates: The second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid, </span>is referring to a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that he needs the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>whereas the first <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the buyer did <span class="gemarra-regular">not say to him </span>that he requires it <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if one said that he is selling: <span class="gemarra-regular">A wine cellar, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the seller is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality. If one said that he is selling: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>then the seller is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality, but the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself ten </span>barrels of <span class="gemarra-regular">souring </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>barrels purchased. If one said that he is selling: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, </span>and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the seller may <span class="gemarra-regular">give to him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sold in the shops, </span>i.e., it is beginning to sour.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one said that he is selling: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine cellar, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about this. One says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine per hundred, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one says: </span>The buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accept </span>any barrels of souring wine.
The Gemara explains their reasoning. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine per hundred <span class="gemarra-regular">infers </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">though </span>a precise reading of the <span class="it-text">barait</span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Zevid, as it teaches: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you a wine cellar, </span>then he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we interpreted </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking. </span>The Gemara explains the inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that he must provide him with wine that is all of good quality is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that he needed it <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking. </span>By inference, where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say to him: </span>I need it <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not accept </span>any barrels of souring wine <span class="gemarra-regular">infers </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>a precise reading <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the first <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it teaches: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you a wine cellar, </span>then he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him wine that is all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we interpreted </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not say to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>and even so, the buyer need not accept any barrels of souring wine.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who infers </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>a precise reading of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Zevid, the </span>first <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty. </span>The Gemara answers that according to his opinion, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>If one says: I am selling to you a cellar of wine, then he is required to give him wine that is all of good quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said?</span> It is said in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking. </span>By inference, where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine per hundred. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if one said that he is selling: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">wine cellar, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him:</span> I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>then one may <span class="gemarra-regular">give to him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wine</span> that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sold in the shops, </span>i.e., it is beginning to sour.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who infers </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>a precise reading of the first <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Zevid </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty, as we interpreted it </span>as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking. </span>And this opinion inferred that if the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him:</span> I need it <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>then the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same is true </span>according to both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that even where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to him: </span>I need the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">need not accept </span>ten barrels of souring wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is no proof from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we interpreted </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: </span>I need it <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>since we did so only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the difficulty </span>of the contradiction between the ruling of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the case where the seller specified that he was selling <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>cellar and the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rav Zevid in the same case where the seller specified he was selling <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> cellar. Due to that difficulty, the entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was interpreted as referring to a case where the buyer said: I need the wine for cooking, despite the fact that in the case where he did not mention a specific cellar it makes no difference whether or not he said so.
§ Apropos wine that is sold in the shops, the Gemara considers additional <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> pertaining to such wine: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: Over wine </span>of the same quality as that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is sold in the shops</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one recites the </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">blessing </span>for wine: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who creates fruit of the vine. </span>Despite the fact that such wine is not of the highest quality, it is still regarded as wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda said: Over wine that has formed a film </span>as it begins to sour, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need to recite the blessing for wine? Since it has begun to sour, it is no longer regarded as wine. Instead, one should recite the generic blessing recited over foods of lower importance: By Whose word all things came to be.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Yehuda’s opinion. It is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Over bread that has become moldy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and over wine that has formed a film, and over a cooked dish that has spoiled, one recites </span>the blessing: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Whose word all things came to be. </span>Since these foods have partially spoiled, it is inappropriate to recite the specific blessings designated for such foods in their fresh state.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: Rav Yehuda concedes </span>that one does not recite the blessing of: Who creates fruit of the vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">on wine made from grape seeds that is sold on the </span>street <span class="gemarra-regular">corners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is to such significantly inferior wine that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers. Wine sold in the shops still has the taste and appearance of wine, so one should recite the standard blessing for wine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda. In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does the Master hold? </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I know a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">barait</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> from which it is possible to derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. 

Daf 96a

<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 2:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who inspects a barre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> to see if it still contains enough wine <span class="gemarra-regular">to continually </span>mentally <span class="gemarra-regular">separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it </span>to exempt other untithed wine he has, until all the wine in that barrel would be <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and would be given to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward </span>the contents of the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to have turned to <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, </span>which cannot be set aside as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> for untithed wine, then <span class="gemarra-regular">all three days </span>after he had last inspected it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been wine, and any wine for which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was separated during those days is tithed. <span class="gemarra-regular">From that </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>more than three days after the previous inspection, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as to whether it had already turned to vinegar, and any wine for which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was separated during those days is not tithed.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first three days </span>following the inspection, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>that had not yet turned to vinegar. <span class="gemarra-regular">From that </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>as to whether it had already turned to vinegar. Accordingly, any wine for which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was separated after those three days by means of designating the contents of that barrel as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> has an uncertain status.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>The process in which <span class="gemarra-regular">wine turns sour </span>and becomes vinegar starts <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the wine at the <span class="gemarra-regular">top </span>of the barrel; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>wine which <span class="gemarra-regular">he tasted </span>when he inspected it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at that time <span class="gemarra-regular">it had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">soured. </span>And even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">after he tasted it </span>the wine began to <span class="gemarra-regular">sour, </span>during the following three days <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">have the odor of vinegar and its taste </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, and anything </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">has an odor of vinegar but its taste is of win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says </span>that there is a different interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: For <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the last three days </span>preceding the discovery that the wine had turned into vinegar, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar. From that </span>point and <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier, </span>until the time it had been inspected, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>whether or not it was wine or vinegar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>The process in which <span class="gemarra-regular">wine turns sour </span>and becomes vinegar starts <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the wine at the <span class="gemarra-regular">bottom </span>of the barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore, since the inspection was limited to the wine at the top of the barrel, it is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that wine at the bottom <span class="gemarra-regular">had</span> already started to <span class="gemarra-regular">sour and one was unaware of it. </span>Consequently, it is possible that on the day he tasted it the wine turned entirely into vinegar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that the process in which <span class="gemarra-regular">wine turns sour </span>and becomes vinegar starts <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the wine at the <span class="gemarra-regular">top </span>of the barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>wine that <span class="gemarra-regular">he tasted </span>when he inspected it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at that time <span class="gemarra-regular">it had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">soured, perhaps </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">after he tasted it </span>the wine began to <span class="gemarra-regular">sour, </span>in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">its odor </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">of vinegar and its taste of wine, and </span>anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">has an odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine </span>is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the South taught </span>another interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: </span>For the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>three days it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">wine. </span>For the <span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>three days it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar. </span>The status of the wine during the <span class="gemarra-regular">intervening </span>period is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter itself </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as, since <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>that for the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>three days it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">wine; apparently, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it has the odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine </span>it is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine. But then you said </span>that for the <span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>three days it is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>viewed as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar; apparently, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it has the odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine </span>it is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, </span>as it can be established only that the odor had changed three days ago.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: The Sages of the South hold that as long as the wine still tastes like wine, it is regarded as wine. When they said that when a barrel is found to contain vinegar it is certain that the wine had already turned into vinegar three days previously, they were referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">was found </span>to contain <span class="gemarra-regular">strong vinegar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as, had it not </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">soured three days </span>previously, the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">would not have been found </span>to contain <span class="gemarra-regular">strong vinegar; </span>rather, it would contain only mild vinegar.
Rav Yosef claimed that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can serve as proof with regard to which blessing is recited over wine that has the odor of vinegar but tastes like wine. Having cited three different interpretations of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>whose interpretation did Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the question of which blessing to recite? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari and Rav Zevid disagree about it. One said </span>that Rav Yosef resolved it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the interpretation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>that this liquid is regarded as wine and the blessing for wine should be recited over it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said </span>that Rav Yosef resolved it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the interpretation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, </span>that the liquid is regarded as vinegar and the generic blessing: By Whose word all things came to be, should be recited over it. There is no definitive resolution of the dispute.
§ An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a barrel of wine to another, and </span>following the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">it turned to vinegar. Rav said: </span>If it soured during <span class="gemarra-regular">any of the first three days </span>following the sale, it is presumed that it had already began to sour <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he bears financial responsibility for it; <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>it is presumed that the wine soured <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer, </span>and it is his loss. 

Daf 96b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>Even if the wine sours shortly after the purchase, the seller does not bear responsibility, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is agitated </span>as it is carried <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the shoulders of its </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, </span>causing it to sour quickly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef ruled </span>in an actual <span class="gemarra-regular">case in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, in </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">bee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> spoiled shortly after it was sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel in </span>a similar case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">wine. And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whether </span>one drinks <span class="gemarra-regular">date beer, or barley beer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>a beverage made from soaking <span class="gemarra-regular">pomace </span>from the production of <span class="gemarra-regular">win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in water, known as <span class="it-text">tamad</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">one recites over them the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Over </span>wine made from <span class="gemarra-regular">pomace that has the taste of wine </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the vine. Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>According to the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">of everyone </span>mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one poured three </span>jugs of water over grape pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then, after removing the pomace, the volume of the resulting beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>jugs, then that beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine. </span>Evidently, a quarter of the resulting beverage is from juice that was contained in the pomace, which is pure wine, and that is a sufficient ratio for the beverage as a whole to be regarded as wine. The Gemara interjects Rava’s comments: With this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava said: Any wine that does not contain three </span>parts <span class="gemarra-regular">water to one </span>part pure wine <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>as it is excessively strong.
Rava continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one poured thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> jugs of water over pomace, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the volume of the resulting beverage still <span class="gemarra-regular">came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>jugs, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is nothing, </span>i.e., it is not regarded as wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one poured three </span>jugs of water over pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the volume of the resulting beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three and a half </span>jugs, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>jugs of water <span class="gemarra-regular">were absorbed into </span>the pomace and then the same <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>jugs of water <span class="gemarra-regular">seeped out </span>of the pomace; therefore, there <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>a jug of the resulting beverage that was originally pure wine contained in the pomace. <span class="gemarra-regular">But half </span>a jug of pure wine mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">into six half-</span>jugs of <span class="gemarra-regular">water is nothing, </span>i.e., the mixture is too weak to be regarded as wine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>jugs of water <span class="gemarra-regular">were absorbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>the pomace but only <span class="gemarra-regular">two and a half </span>jugs of water <span class="gemarra-regular">seeped out </span>of the pomace, as one jug of water replaced the one jug of pure wine contained in the pomace. Therefore, there <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">jug </span>of the resulting beverage that is pure wine that was previously contained in the pomace. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">jug </span>of pure wine mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">into two and a half </span>jugs of water <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged wine.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where </span>the volume of the resulting beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the amount </span>of water that was poured over the pomace, <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>the Sages ever <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 5:6): 

Daf 97a

In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who produces </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tamad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a beverage made by steeping grape pomace in water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he placed a measured </span>amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>into a container together with the pomace, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>after removing the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">he found </span>that the volume of the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced was <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the amount </span>of water used, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the requirement to tithe the <span class="it-text">tamad</span>, even though the pomace came from grapes that had not been tithed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to tithe the <span class="it-text">tamad</span>. The Gemara explains the difficulty posed by this mishna: It would appear that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree only with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the volume of the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced was <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the amount </span>of water used, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a case where the volume of the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced was <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the amount </span>of water used, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not disagree; </span>rather, they all agree that it must be tithed because it is regarded as wine. This would appear to contradict Rava’s explanation.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Actually, <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would disagree even where </span>the volume of the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced was <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the amount </span>of water used. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna records only that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>about a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the volume of the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced was <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the amount </span>of water used is in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that one is liable to tithe the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> even in this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak asked Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin: </span>If one steeps <span class="gemarra-regular">pomace </span>and produces <span class="it-text">tamad</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that has the taste of wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the blessing that one should recite before drinking it? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you hold </span>that such a beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">is wine? It is merely a sharp-flavored </span>beverage, not wine.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning the production of successive batches of <span class="it-text">tamad</span> of decreasing strengths by reusing the pomace after each time a <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is produced: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">pomace of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> wine, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first and second </span>products are considered to be <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for a non-priest to drink it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span>product, a non-priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to drink it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Even </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">imparts </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">flavo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of wine to the water, it is forbidden to a non-priest.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to water added to pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>second<span class="gemarra-regular">-tithe </span>wine, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>product is also considered to be second tithe, and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to drink it outside Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>product, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to drink it anywhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Even </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">imparts </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">flavor </span>of wine to the water, it may be consumed only in Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to water added to pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>wine that was <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the Temple, up to the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>product it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to derive any benefit from it, as it is considered to be consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth </span>product, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted. Rabbi Meir says: Even </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">imparts </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">flavor </span>of wine to the water, it is prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="it-text">Tamad</span> produced from the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>wine that was <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>to the Temple is <span class="gemarra-regular">always forbidden, </span>even after having steeped them many times, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the beverage produced from pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe is always permitted, </span>even from the first such product. The Gemara explains: The ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>pomace is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it is contradicted by the ruling of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>pomace. And the ruling concerning second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>pomace is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it is contradicted by the ruling of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>pomace.
The Gemara answers: The contradiction between the ruling of one <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>pomace and the ruling of the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>pomace is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as one can explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">with inherent sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">with sanctity </span>that inheres in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value. </span>Also, the contradiction between the ruling of one <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning pomace of second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>and the ruling of the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning pomace of second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as one can explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to pomace whose status as second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">doubtfully tithed produce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">same way in which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>concerning differing strengths of <span class="it-text">tamad</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to their prohibition, </span>after a certain number of times the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> produced is not considered to be wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>the same rulings <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to their capacity to render </span>foods <span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible </span>to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: When the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">their capacity to render</span> other foods <span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible </span>to ritual impurity, why does it matter <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>kind of beverage the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is considered to be? <span class="gemarra-regular">Whether </span>the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> it can <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible </span>to impurity, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">wine it </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible </span>to impurity. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which one produced </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tamad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rainwate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that he had not previously intended to use. Rainwater does not render food susceptible to ritual impurity, so the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> will do so only if it is regarded as wine.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since he took </span>the rainwater <span class="gemarra-regular">and poured it into a container</span> holding the grape pomace, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">intended it </span>for a use. Even if the resulting <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is regarded as water, such rainwater renders food susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">produced </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tamad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> having been steeped in water that happened to fall upon it.
The Gemara persists: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above states that from the third product, the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is regarded as water, which the Gemara has explained is referring to rainwater that one did not intend to use and that consequently cannot render food susceptible to impurity. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since he draws off </span>each subsequent lot of <span class="it-text">tamad</span> that is produced, <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one, </span>in order to allow more rainwater to fall onto the pomace and produce more <span class="it-text">tamad</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>thereby demonstrates his <span class="gemarra-regular">intent to </span>use the rainwater. Therefore, even if the <span class="it-text">tamad</span> is regarded as water, it should render food susceptible to impurity. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says </span>that this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a cow that dran</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the lots of <span class="it-text">tamad</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one, </span>and some inadvertently dripped from the cow’s mouth onto food. Since no person intended to use the <span class="it-text">tamad</span>, if it is regarded as water it will not render food susceptible to impurity.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zutra bar Toviyya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One may recite the sanctification of the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day only over wine </span>of a quality that is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to be poured </span>as a libation <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: This statement is said <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>fresh <span class="gemarra-regular">from one’s press</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., grape juice, which has not yet fermented, that is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One may not bring wine </span>fresh <span class="gemarra-regular">from his pres</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> as a libation <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if one brought </span>it as a libation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid </span>after the fact. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since if one brought </span>it as a libation <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid </span>after the fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be able to use it for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 97b

<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava says: A person may squeeze </span>the juice from <span class="gemarra-regular">a cluster of grapes and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">recite the sanctification of the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day over it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>wine that is taken <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth of </span>the barrel, which has scum floating in it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>wine taken <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bottom of </span>the barrel, which contains the pomace. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One may not bring </span>wine that is taken <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth of </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">or from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bottom of </span>the barrel as a libation <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if one brought</span> it as a libation <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid </span>after the fact? Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude black wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">borek</span> wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">sweet wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">heiliston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cellar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and wine made <span class="gemarra-regular">from raisins</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to all of </span>these types of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bring </span>them as a libation <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if one brought </span>one of them as a libation <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid </span>after the fact. Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude souring wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diluted </span>wine, wine that has been left <span class="gemarra-regular">uncovered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as there is a concern that a snake may have injected its venom into it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>wine made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>grape <span class="gemarra-regular">pomace, and </span>wine that has a <span class="gemarra-regular">foul odor. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to all of </span>these types of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bring </span>them as a libation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if one brought </span>one of them as a libation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is disqualified.</span>
The Gemara asks again: Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude which </span>of these types of wine? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests Rav intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude souring </span>wine, that cannot be, as the status of wine that tastes like wine but has the odor of vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">is the</span> subject of a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi </span>(96a).
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude diluted </span>wine, why would such wine be disqualified for the sanctification of the Shabbat day? Diluting wine <span class="gemarra-regular">is an improvement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of it, as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: </span>Even though the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and hold that over undiluted wine one recites the blessing: Who created the fruit of the vine, nevertheless the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a cup </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">for a blessing, </span>such as the cup of wine over which Grace after Meals is recited, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one does not recite </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blessing over it until he adds water to it </span>to make it palatable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>wine that has been left <span class="gemarra-regular">uncovered, </span>it would be unnecessary for Rav to teach this, because such wine, which <span class="gemarra-regular">is dangerous </span>to drink, as a snake may have injected its venom into it, is already forbidden.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>wine made <span class="gemarra-regular">from pomace, what are the circumstances? If </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one poured three </span>jugs of water over the pomace <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the volume of the resulting beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">came to fou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> jugs, that <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged wine, </span>which may certainly be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where one poured three </span>jugs of water over the pomace, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the resulting beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">came to three and a half </span>jugs, this <span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>subject of a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who rule that it is not regarded as wine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">a foul odor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>his statement serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>wine that has been left <span class="gemarra-regular">uncovered, and </span>it teaches the novelty that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though one passes it through a sieve, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya </span>(see <span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 8:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">nevertheless, </span>it still may not be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. This is because it is disrespectful to use inferior wine for a mitzva, as derived from the verse in which God rebukes the Jewish people for offering lame animals as offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Present it now unto your governor; will he be pleased with you or will he accept your person? </span>says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana, father-in-law of Rav Mesharshiyya, asked Rava: </span>With regard to using <span class="gemarra-regular">white win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for libations and for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him </span>in response that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Do not look upon the wine when it is red,</span> when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly” (Proverbs 23:31), which indicates that red wine is considered to be of a superior quality.
§ The mishna teaches: When purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs </span>of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sharon </span>region, he accepts upon himself that up to ten inferior-quality jugs may be present in each hundred jugs purchased. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The buyer must accept ten inferior-quality jugs in one hundred only when even those ten <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality jugs </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">beautifu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sealed with pitch </span>to strengthen them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sells wine to another and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility for its </span>loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if it is known </span>of this seller <span class="gemarra-regular">that his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">sours, then this </span>sale <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mistaken transaction, </span>i.e., one based upon false assumptions, as the buyer intended to purchase wine that would maintain its quality; therefore, the seller must reimburse the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">wine</span>

Daf 98a

that is <span class="gemarra-regular">spiced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is preserved and of lasting quality, that <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling to you, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility to provide him </span>with wine that will keep <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the festival of <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>if the seller said: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>wine, he is responsible to provide wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from the previous year. And </span>if he said: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">aged </span>wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is <span class="gemarra-regular">from three year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> earlier.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>that the seller does not bear responsibility if the wine sours, that was <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if it soured while <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buyer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it soured <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">could say to him: This is your wine and this is your jug; </span>take it and reimburse me. Since it soured while still in the original jugs, it was clearly flawed from the outset.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the wine soured while in the <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of the seller, what of it? Let </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should not have left i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for so long after purchasing it; I should not be responsible just because you chose to do so. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">had said to him </span>that he was purchasing the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking, </span>in which case it is understood that he needs it to maintain its quality over a longer period of time, as only a small amount is used each time.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what impelled Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, to interpret the mishna as referring to </span>a case where the wine soured while in the <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of the buyer, and where he had said to him </span>that he wanted the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking? </span>Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him interpret it as referring to </span>a case where the wine soured while in the <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of the seller, and </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he had not said to him </span>that he wanted the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking.</span>
In explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him, as it teaches </span>in the following clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if it is known </span>of this seller <span class="gemarra-regular">that his wine </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">sours, then this </span>sale <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mistaken transaction. </span>With regard to this clause one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is that so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You should not have left it </span>for so long after purchasing it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>that clause <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">had said to him </span>that he wants the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for cooking? </span>The Gemara concludes: Yes, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that this is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef, as Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner’s </span>poor <span class="gemarra-regular">fortune </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">causes </span>the wine to go sour, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer; </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">haughty man </span>abides not” (Habakkuk 2:5), which is interpreted to mean that the wine of a haughty man will betray him, as it will sour as a punishment for his arrogance. Accordingly, since the wine soured after the buyer purchased it, he cannot place the blame upon the seller.
The Gemara offers additional homiletic interpretations of the verse just cited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said: One who is haughty is not accepted even by the members of his household</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “The haughty man abides not” </span>(Habakkuk 2:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“abides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">inveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] not” </span>mean? It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">even in his abode [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>he is not accepted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who glorifies himself </span>by wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment of </span>the style worn by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar, but </span>in reality <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not a Torah scholar, he will not be brought within the boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, </span>in the World-to-Come. This is alluded to by the fact that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">here: “Abides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">inveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] not,” and </span>the meaning of the word <span class="it-text">yinveh</span> may be derived from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">there: “To Your holy habitation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 15:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a barrel of wine to a shopkeepe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the understanding </span>that the wine will be <span class="gemarra-regular">for servin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to the shopkeeper’s customers and that he will be liable to pay the seller only once the barrel is finished, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">spoiled </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half or one-third </span>of the wine still remained, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is that </span>the seller must <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>back the remaining wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the shopkeeper, as the shopkeeper is liable to pay only for the wine that he sells. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we stated this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the shopkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">had not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">switched the ta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> of the barrel; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he had switched the tap, </span>the seller does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to take the wine back and the shopkeeper must pay for it all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we stated this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>the wine soured <span class="gemarra-regular">before the market da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrived </span>and the shopkeeper did not have the opportunity to sell the entire barrel; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the wine was still of good quality when <span class="gemarra-regular">the market day arrived, </span>then the seller does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to take the wine back.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>In the case of a vintner who enters a business venture with another person who will sell the wine for him and afterward they will split the profits, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>middleman <span class="gemarra-regular">who receives the wine </span>to sell does so <span class="gemarra-regular">with the understanding that he will bring i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the por</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Vol Shefa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and sell it only there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and before he arrives there </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">price </span>of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">drops, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the vintner must <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>the loss.
With regard to the previous case, <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes vinegar </span>before he reaches Vol Shefat, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, he said to us: </span>If the wine becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, </span>the vintner does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to accept the loss; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>who holds that as long as the wine is in the jug of the seller he is able to return it to the seller. The reason for this is that it is possible that the poor fortune of the middleman caused it to sour.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the wine turns into <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar, </span>the vintner must <span class="gemarra-regular">also accept </span>the loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</span>
The mishna teaches: If the seller said: I am selling you <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>wine, he is responsible to provide wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from the previous year. </span>And if he said: I am selling you aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is from three years earlier. 

Daf 98b

<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>where he sold him aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that will <span class="gemarra-regular">continue to age, </span>i.e., maintain its quality, <span class="gemarra-regular">until the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a plot </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with the buyer intending to build a bridal house for his son or a widowhood home for his daughter on that plot, <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly, </span>with regard to a contractor <span class="gemarra-regular">who receives a plot </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>under a commission <span class="gemarra-regular">to build for </span>the owner on that land <span class="gemarra-regular">a bridal house for his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a widowhood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for his daughter, </span>the terms of the transaction are a matter of dispute. The mishna presents the dispute: In the latter case, the contractor must <span class="gemarra-regular">build </span>a building that is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits by six </span>cubits in size, and similarly, in the case of the sale, the seller must provide a plot of land that can accommodate a building of that size; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says: </span>A structure of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>size <span class="gemarra-regular">is a cowshed, </span>and a bridal house or a widowhood home is larger than that.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who wants to construct a cowshe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> builds </span>a structure at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits by six </span>cubits in size.
The mishna delineates the standard dimensions for various other structures. <span class="gemarra-regular">A small house</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">six by eight </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">A large </span>house is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight by ten </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">A banquet hall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teraklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten by ten </span>cubits. The standard <span class="gemarra-regular">height </span>for each of these structures is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to</span> the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">half its length and half its width. </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>The proportions are <span class="gemarra-regular">like the building of the Sanctuary; </span>it was forty cubits wide and twenty cubits long and its height was thirty cubits, which is the sum of half the width and half the length.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach </span>specifically: <span class="gemarra-regular">A bridal house for his son, and: A widowhood home for his daughter? </span>Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach: A bridal house for his son or his daughter, and a widowhood home for his son or his daughter. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches us a matter in passing, that it is not the </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">for a son-in-law to live in his father-in-law’s home. </span>Therefore, it is the father of the groom who generally provides a bridal home for the couple and the bride will return to live near her parents’ house only if she is widowed or divorced.
Support for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written in the book of ben Sira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I have weighed everything in the pan of a balance scale and I have not found anything inferior to bran</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but inferior to bran is a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and inferior to a son-in-law is a guest who brings in a guest;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and inferior to a guest is one who answers a matter before he listens. As it is stated: “He that gives an answe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before he listens</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is folly for him and a disgrace” </span>(Proverbs 18:13).
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: </span>A structure of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>size <span class="gemarra-regular">is a cowshed. </span>And then the mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who wants to construct </span>a cowshed builds a structure at least four cubits by six cubits in size. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who teaches </span>this subsequent clause about <span class="gemarra-regular">a cowshed? There is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael teaches it </span>and it is an elaboration of his statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva teaches it </span>in response to Rabbi Yishmael’s statement.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva teaches it, and this </span>is what Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even though </span>this structure <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>of the same dimensions as <span class="gemarra-regular">a cowshed, </span>nevertheless, since there are <span class="gemarra-regular">times when a person constructs his home </span>as small <span class="gemarra-regular">as a cowshed, </span>a contractor has fulfilled his commission if he builds a house to such dimensions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael teaches it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this </span>is what Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>to Rabbi Akiva: The dimensions that you stated are clearly not the correct dimensions for a bridal house or widowhood home, <span class="gemarra-regular">as one who wants to construct a cowshed constructs</span> a structure of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits by six </span>cubits. A house for human dwelling is certainly larger than that.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A banquet hall </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten by ten </span>cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a banquet hall? A pavilion of roses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The standard size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kanteir</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve by twelve </span>cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kanteir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is a decorative <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard of a mansion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The mishna teaches: The standard <span class="gemarra-regular">height </span>for each of these structures is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">half its length and half its width. </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>The proportions are <span class="gemarra-regular">like the building of the Sanctuary. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who teaches </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Proof of the matter? There is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches it, and this </span>is what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: From where </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof of the matter </span>be derived? The mishna then cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everything is like the building of the Sanctuary.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there is </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches it, and, </span>understanding that the proof the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> wished to cite was from the example of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>interjected and <span class="gemarra-regular">expressed astonishmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> at the idea. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: From where </span>do you derive <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof? </span>Do you derive it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the building of the Sanctuary? Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone constructs </span>their buildings <span class="gemarra-regular">like the building of the Sanctuary? </span>Why should they do so?
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: </span>The standard <span class="gemarra-regular">height of </span>each of these structures is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to </span>the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">its crossbeams. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>more simply that <span class="gemarra-regular">its height </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to its width. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that formulating the ruling in this way is necessary, because the space inside <span class="gemarra-regular">a house widens at the top, </span>as the walls get thinner toward the top and the crossbeams are actually longer than the width of the floor of the building. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that formulating it in this way is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because there are indentations </span>in the wall into which the crossbeams are inserted. The crossbeams are consequently longer than the space inside the house.
§ Apropos the building of the Sanctuary, the Gemara relates the following incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">went out to the villages </span>to teach Torah there, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he raised a contradiction between </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">verses </span>that detail the dimensions of the Sanctuary: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “And the house that King Solomon built for the Lord, was sixty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was thirty cubits” </span>(I Kings 6:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And before the partition was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was twenty cubits” </span>(I Kings 6:20). The first verse states that its height was thirty cubits, whereas the second verse states that its height was only twenty cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>the villagers that the reason for the difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the latter verse <span class="gemarra-regular">calculated </span>the height, it did so <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>upper <span class="gemarra-regular">edge of the cherubs and upward, </span>as the cherubs themselves stood ten cubits high.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>by considering only the area above the cherubs? 

Daf 99a

The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: </span>The area <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>the cherubs <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>them; <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the cherubs’ wings, which were spread out in the air, <span class="gemarra-regular">was not used for anything, </span>i.e., it was empty space, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">was not used for anything </span>and was empty.
This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi, as Rabbi Levi said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter is a tradition handed </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">to us by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our ancestors: The space </span>occupied by the <span class="gemarra-regular">Ark </span>of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs is not </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in the measurement </span>of the Holy of Holies in which it rested, as miraculously it did not occupy any space at all. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When they brought <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark that Moses crafted </span>into the Holy of Holies in the Temple of King Solomon, even though the total width of the Holy of Holies was only twenty cubits, nevertheless the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">had ten cubits </span>of empty <span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>between it and the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">in each and every direction.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbenai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs stood miraculousl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and did not occupy any physical space, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And five cubits was one wing of the cherub, and five cubits was the second wing of the cherub; ten cubits from the tip of its wings until the tip of its wings” </span>(I Kings 6:24). Accordingly, the wings of two cherubs, standing side by side, would occupy the entire twenty cubits width of the Sanctuary. But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>in what space, <span class="gemarra-regular">were their bodies standing? </span>Since their wings alone, which protruded from the sides of cherubs’ bodies, occupied twenty cubits, there was no room left in which their bodies could stand. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the verse that the cherubs <span class="gemarra-regular">stood miraculously </span>and did not occupy any physical space.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye objects to this </span>proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they stood </span>with their bodies <span class="gemarra-regular">emerging </span>beneath their wings, <span class="gemarra-regular">like chickens, </span>with their wings protruding above them from the same point in the center of their backs. If so, their bodies would stand beneath their wings and would not occupy any additional space. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this </span>proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they stood </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was not next to that </span>one and the wings of the two cherubs overlapped, thereby allowing for the additional space occupied by their bodies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this </span>proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they were standing in a diagonal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ba’alakhsona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> alignment from one corner of the Holy of Holies to the diagonally opposite corner. In this way there would be enough space for their bodies and their wings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna son of Rav Yehoshua </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this </span>proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the width of twenty cubits stated in the verse refers only to the width at ground level, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the room widened at the top </span>and was therefore able to accommodate both their wings and the width of the bodies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this </span>proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they were folding their wings </span>somewhat; since their wings were not fully extended they did not actually fill the full twenty cubits of the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this</span> proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>their wings <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> one another, so that they did not occupy so much space.
§ Continuing its focus on the cherubs, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How were </span>the cherubs <span class="gemarra-regular">standing? Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar </span>disagree about this. <span class="gemarra-regular">One says: Their faces </span>were turned <span class="gemarra-regular">one toward the other. And one says: Their faces </span>were turned <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the House</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the Sanctuary. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">their faces </span>were turned <span class="gemarra-regular">one toward the other, isn’t it written: “And their faces were toward the House” </span>(II Chronicles 3:13)? How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as their faces miraculously changed directions in reflection of the Jewish people’s relationship to God. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>when it states that the cherubs faced each other, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Jewish people do the will of God. There, </span>the verse that describes that the cherubs faced the Sanctuary and not toward each other, was <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Jewish people do not do the will of God.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>they stood as described in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And their faces were toward the House,” isn’t it written: “With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their faces one toward the other” </span>(Exodus 25:20). How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were angled sideways </span>so that they turned both to each other and toward the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Onkelos the Convert said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs were </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the verse states: “And in the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of the form of children; and they overlaid them with gold” (II Chronicles 3:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and their faces were angled sideways </span>toward the Ark of the Covenant, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a student taking leave of his teacher.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the house of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the cistern can be accessed only by entering the property of the other, and also has access rights to that cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">may enter </span>the house to access his cistern only <span class="gemarra-regular">at a time when it is usual for people to enter, and may leave </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at a time when it is usual for people to leave. And </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not bring his animal </span>into the house <span class="gemarra-regular">and water </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from his cistern; rather, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">fill </span>a pail with water from the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and water </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">outside. And this </span>one, the owner of the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">constructs for himself a lock </span>on the entrance to the cistern to prevent the homeowner from drawing water from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the homeowner, <span class="gemarra-regular">constructs for himself a lock.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the owner of the cistern and the homeowner each construct a lock. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">A lock to where? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them </span>construct a lock on the opening <span class="gemarra-regular">to the cistern </span>to prevent the other from accessing it unilaterally. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, the owner of the cistern </span>constructs a lock, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he wants to protect the water of his well. But why </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the homeowner </span>construct a lock? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>

Daf 99b

He does so <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a suspicion </span>that the owner of the cistern might enter the house at a time when the owner of the house is not present, and thereby be secluded together in the house with the homeowner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">a garden </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the garden of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and also has access rights to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">may enter </span>his garden only <span class="gemarra-regular">at a time when it is usual for people to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and may leave </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at a time when it is usual for people to leave. </span>Furthermore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not bring merchants into </span>his garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may not </span>enter the garden solely in order to use it as a passageway, to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter from it into another field. And the </span>owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>garden <span class="gemarra-regular">may sow the path </span>leading to the inner garden.
If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">gave him </span>an access <span class="gemarra-regular">path from the side </span>of the outer garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">with the agreement of both of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">may enter at </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">time he wants, and leave at </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">time he wants, and may bring merchants into </span>the inner garden. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>enter the garden solely in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter from it into another field. </span>In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither this </span>one, the owner of the inner garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one, the owner of the outer garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to plant </span>that side path.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>If a field owner says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>from my land a water <span class="gemarra-regular">channel </span>fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>bringing water to <span class="gemarra-regular">an irrigated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">for the inside </span>of the channel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit on that </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">banks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a shadoof [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kilon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">channel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">for the inside </span>of the channel <span class="gemarra-regular">and half a cubit on this </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and half a cubit on that </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">for its banks.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those banks, who </span>has permission to <span class="gemarra-regular">sow them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: The field owner may sow them </span>with vegetables or crops. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span> says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: The field owner may plant them </span>with trees. The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that the field owner <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sow them </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so he may plant them </span>with trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may plant them </span>with trees holds that he may only plant trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">but sowing them </span>with other plants is <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> permitted. This is because the roots <span class="gemarra-regular">perforate </span>the ground, which weakens it and can cause damage to the water channel.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel whose banks collapsed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the channel may <span class="gemarra-regular">repair it </span>with earth <span class="gemarra-regular">from that field </span>through which the channel runs, even though the field does not belong to him. It is permitted because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known that </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">its banks collapsed </span>the earth that the banks were made from spread <span class="gemarra-regular">only into that </span>surrounding <span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to this: But let </span>the field owner <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the channel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your water </span>in your channel <span class="gemarra-regular">carried awa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your earth </span>from your banks, so you have no right to take earth from my field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Pappa said </span>he may repair the banks with earth from the field <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the field owner </span>sold the rights to the channel <span class="gemarra-regular">he accepted that condition upon himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who had a public thoroughfare passing through his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriated it and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the public an alternative thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">on the side </span>of his property, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">that he gave </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>them, and they may use it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the original thoroughfare that he took <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself has not reached him, </span>i.e., he cannot appropriate it for his personal use.
The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private path </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>If a field owner sells the right to pass through his field to an individual, without specifying the width of the path, he must provide him with a path four cubits wide. The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public thoroughfar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits. </span>The width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a king’s thoroughfare has no </span>maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the king may appropriate whatever width thoroughfare he wishes. The width of the <span class="gemarra-regular">path for </span>the burial procession to <span class="gemarra-regular">a grav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no </span>maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">standin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and comforting the mourners following a funeral, <span class="gemarra-regular">the judges of Tzippori said </span>that the standard requisite size is the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does the mishna rule that the public thoroughfare that the landowner took <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself has not reached </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If by making the exchange the original thoroughfare now belongs to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him take a stick [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pazra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and sit </span>on the thoroughfare and physically prevent anyone from passing through. Apparently, the Sages did not permit him to do so. The Gemara suggests: Does it follow that one can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna’s ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not execute judgment for himself even in circumstances </span>where refraining from acting will cause him <span class="gemarra-regular">a loss? </span>This would contradict the accepted <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one may do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: </span>Although generally one may do so, in this case the Sages issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>prohibiting it, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he give them a circuitous route </span>that will lengthen the distance the public will have to travel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya said in the name of Rava </span>that the ruling of the mishna applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">gives them a circuitous route </span>instead of the original straight thoroughfare. But one may exchange a public thoroughfare for an equally straight thoroughfare, appropriating the original for his personal use. 

Daf 100a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Any </span>alternative path <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the original path <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a circuitous route, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">close for this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is far for that </span>person. While some will benefit from the change, it will be detrimental to others. Therefore, one may never exchange a public path for an alternative path.
§ The mishna teaches that if a field owner provides an alternative thoroughfare through his field for the public to use, the public may use both thoroughfares. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let him say to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Take your </span>original thoroughfare back <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> give me my </span>thoroughfare that I provided you. The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span> mishna? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">public selected a thoroughfare </span>through a privately owned field <span class="gemarra-regular">for themselves </span>even without gaining the permission of the field owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which they selected, they selected, </span>and they have the right to use it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, are </span>the members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">public </span>entitled to be <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why should they be permitted to appropriate land from a private owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>Rabbi Eliezer refers only to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the public <span class="gemarra-regular">lost a thoroughfare in that field, </span>e.g., the field was plowed over and the original course of the thoroughfare is not known. In such a case, the public has the right to determine the course anew.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why does Rabba bar Rav Huna say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer? </span>His reasoning seems valid. The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches this, </span>i.e., that Rabbi Eliezer is referring to a case where a thoroughfare was lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach that, </span>i.e., that Rav rules against Rabbi Eliezer. There is a dispute as to what Rav said.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to Rabba bar Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>the field owner cannot reclaim the alternative thoroughfare that he gave to the public? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to a strip of land that serves as <span class="gemarra-regular">a border </span>between two strips of land <span class="gemarra-regular">that the public took possession o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> as a public thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to destroy it </span>for them, i.e., prevent people from using it. Accordingly, in the case of the mishna, where the field owner actually provided the public with a thoroughfare, he may certainly not take it back.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, through what </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">does the public acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the thoroughfare they choose? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">By </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>on the thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one walked along </span>a field’s <span class="gemarra-regular">length and its breadth, he has acquired the area </span>inside <span class="gemarra-regular">where he walked, </span>as walking is an effective act of acquisition; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say </span>that by itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">walkin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">at all </span>to acquire a field, and it is not acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">until he takes possession </span>of it using a legal act of acquisition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written </span>that after God promised Abraham Eretz Yisrael, He instructed him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Arise, walk through the land, its length and its breadth; for I will give it to you” </span>(Genesis 13:17), in order that Abraham should thereby acquire the land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>how do they interpret this verse? They hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in Genesis, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">love of Abraham that he said to him </span>to do <span class="gemarra-regular">this, in order that it would be easy for his descendants to conquer </span>the land. His walking was to demonstrate the divine promise and thereby emphasize his descendants’ claim to the land, but it did not effect acquisition of it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a path </span>that passes <span class="gemarra-regular">through vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the path <span class="gemarra-regular">is made </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for walking </span>on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be acquired by</span> means of <span class="gemarra-regular">walkin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> on it.
The Gemara relates an incident involving the allocation of a path through a vineyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami </span>for judgment with regard to the width of a path through a vineyard that someone had purchased, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: Give him </span>a path wide enough <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one can carry a load [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tuna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of vine branches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dishvishta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> along it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is able to <span class="gemarra-regular">turn around </span>while holding them. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sides of the path <span class="gemarra-regular">are bounded by a fence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which would physically prevent a person from carrying a load of vine branches that are wider than the path, and therefore, if necessary, the path must be widened by breaking down the fence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>where the sides <span class="gemarra-regular">are not bound by a fence, </span>a person carrying a load of vine branches will not be prevented from passing along it. Consequently, he needs only to be given a path wide enough <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he can lift up </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">foot and place </span>it in front of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">foot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private pat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: </span>A private path is wide enough <span class="gemarra-regular">so that a donkey can pass on </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with his load. Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The judges of the exil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the standard width is <span class="gemarra-regular">two and a half cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">judges of the exile. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Huna say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>definition <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>definition <span class="gemarra-regular">are one </span>and the same <span class="gemarra-regular">measure.</span>
The mishna teaches: The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public thoroughfare </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private path </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits. </span>The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a road </span>that goes <span class="gemarra-regular">from city to cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight cubits. </span>

Daf 100b

The standard width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public thoroughfare </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits. A road </span>leading to one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">cities of refug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty-two cubits </span>wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: What is the verse </span>from which this is derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>with regard to the cities of refuge: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall prepare for yourself the way, </span>and divide the borders of your land that the Lord, your God, caused you to inherit, into three parts, so that every manslayer may flee there” (Deuteronomy 19:3). Instead of simply stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">A way, </span>the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The way,” </span>to indicate that the road must be twice as wide as a standard public thoroughfare.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A king’s thoroughfare has no </span>maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure. </span>The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that a king may breach </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fence </span>of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to create a thoroughfare for himself, and none </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">protest his </span>actions.
The mishna teaches: The <span class="gemarra-regular">path for </span>those accompanying a deceased person to <span class="gemarra-regular">a grave has no </span>maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure. </span>The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the honor of the deceased</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>and comforting the mourners following a funeral, <span class="gemarra-regular">the judges of Tzippori said </span>that the standard requisite size is the <span class="gemarra-regular">area required for sowing four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of seed. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a family burial plot, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the family <span class="gemarra-regular">sells </span>the land designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">grav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to another, or sells <span class="gemarra-regular">the path </span>that will be used by the burial procession <span class="gemarra-regular">to his grave, </span>or sells <span class="gemarra-regular">the place </span>that will be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for standing </span>and comforting <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>mourners, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>sells the <span class="gemarra-regular">site </span>that will be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for his eulogy, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family members may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come and bury him </span>in his grave <span class="gemarra-regular">even against the will of </span>the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the need to avoid <span class="gemarra-regular">a family flaw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., harm to the family name that would arise if one of the family members was not buried with the rest of his family.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: On their return from the burial, the mourners would stop after traveling a short distance and would sit to bewail the loss of the deceased. They would then stand and continue journeying for a short while and then repeat the procedure. The mourners perform <span class="gemarra-regular">no fewer than seven standings and sitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in honor <span class="gemarra-regular">of the deceased. </span>These seven <span class="gemarra-regular">correspond </span>to the seven references to “vanity” in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Vanity of vanities, says Kohelet; vanity of vanities, all is vanity” </span>(Ecclesiastes 1:2), counting the plural term “vanities” as two references.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: How do they perform </span>this ceremony? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that it is done <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in Judea, initially they would </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">no fewer than seven standings and sitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in honor <span class="gemarra-regular">of the deceased. </span>One of the procession would make a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">such as: Stand, dear </span>friends, <span class="gemarra-regular">stand, </span>after which the mourners would continue on their journey to their home, and then he would say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sit down, dear </span>friends, <span class="gemarra-regular">sit down, </span>at which point they would sit. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, </span>that this is all that the practice entails, then it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to do so even on Shabbat, </span>since there is no explicit eulogy or mourning, whereas the custom is not to do so.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sister of Rami bar Pappa was married to Rav Avya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When <span class="gemarra-regular">she died </span>Rav Avya <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>the practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">standing and sitting for her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef said: He erred in two </span>matters. <span class="gemarra-regular">He erred, </span>as the ceremony is to be <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only with </span>the participation of <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>family members, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he performed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">even with a distant </span>relative. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">erred</span> again, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>mourners should <span class="gemarra-regular">perform this </span>ceremony <span class="gemarra-regular">only on the first day </span>of mourning, the day of the burial, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he performed it on the second day.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: He also erred in this, as </span>mourners should <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the ceremony <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cemetery, but he performed it in the city.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava said: He also erred in this, as </span>mourners should <span class="gemarra-regular">perform it only in a locale where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are accustomed do so, but there, </span>where he performed it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was not the custom </span>to do so.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the claims of Rav Yosef and Abaye from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, </span>that this is all that the practice entails, then it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to do so even on Shabbat. </span>The Gemara explains the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say, </span>as Abaye did, that the ceremony should be performed only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cemetery, or, </span>as Rav Yosef did, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first day, </span>then how could it occur that the ceremony would be performed on Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">what would </span>anyone <span class="gemarra-regular">want </span>to be doing <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cemetery on Shabbat, </span>when it is prohibited to perform a burial? The Gemara explains: It could happen <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city that is close to the cemetery, </span>and this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they brought </span>the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">for burial at twiligh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> just before Shabbat began, so that the return journey took place on Shabbat itself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a plot </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>in order for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to construct for himself </span>an underground <span class="gemarra-regular">catacomb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly </span>the case of a contractor <span class="gemarra-regular">who receives a plot </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>under a commission <span class="gemarra-regular">to construct for him a catacomb. </span>If the size of the catacomb was not specified, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he should make the inside of </span>each burial <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber four cubits </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">by six </span>cubits long <span class="gemarra-regular">and open up into </span>the chamber, by digging into its walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">niches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kukhin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in which the coffins will rest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>niches should be opened up <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>along the length of the chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and three from there, </span>along the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>niches <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">facing </span>the entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">niches </span>should be formed so that <span class="gemarra-regular">their length </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and their height </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>handbreadths, 

Daf 101a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and their width </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: He should construct the inside of </span>each burial <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber six cubits </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">by eight </span>cubits long <span class="gemarra-regular">and open up into </span>the chamber, by digging into its walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">niches.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Four </span>niches should be opened up <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>along the length of the chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and four from there, </span>along the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and three </span>niches <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">facing </span>the entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one from the right of the entrance and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">one from the left.</span>
The mishna describes the general structure of the catacomb: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">fashion a courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the entrance of the </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber </span>that should be <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by six </span>cubits, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to the </span>combined <span class="gemarra-regular">length </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bier </span>of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">and those who bury him, </span>to ensure adequate room for the burial to take place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">open up two </span>burial <span class="gemarra-regular">chambers into </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one from here and one from there, </span>i.e., on opposite sides of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>He should open up <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>burial chambers, one <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>each of the courtyard’s <span class="gemarra-regular">four sides.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">dependent on </span>the nature of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bedrock</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the bedrock is hard and strong it will be able to accommodate more niches, which will be more closely packed together, with less bedrock between them. If the bedrock is softer, fewer and more sparsely spaced niches should be formed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In Rabbi Shimon’s depiction of a burial chamber, he states that two niches should be opened up, one from the right of the entrance and one from the left. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">These two </span>niches, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>direction <span class="gemarra-regular">does he set them? If </span>they are directed <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the chamber, i.e., under the floor of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">won’t </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">trample </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>when they enter the courtyard, which is improper? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, didn’t we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Oholot</span> 15:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">catacomb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stands inside it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>because it can be presumed that he did not stand over a dead body? Clearly, these niches are not to be dug underneath the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: He makes </span>these two niches at the side of the entrance, vertically, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a door bolt.</span>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>with regard to the burial of people in a vertical position: 

Daf 101b

<span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">a burial of donkeys </span>and is disrespectful.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>each of these two niches is <span class="gemarra-regular">formed in </span>a different <span class="gemarra-regular">corne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the chamber, aligned diagonally away from the chamber’s cavity.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">won’t </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">niches </span>located around the corners <span class="gemarra-regular">touc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one another? </span>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s suggestion, there are, in fact, three niches located at each of the two back corners. One is recessed into the wall of the length of the chamber, at right angles to it, another is recessed into the back wall of the chamber, also at right angles to it, and a third that extends diagonally away from the chamber. The ends of these three niches will overlap, causing there to be too little space in them to fulfill the minimum required measurement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>It is possible to do this <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>when constructing the niches that extend diagonally away from the chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">one deepens </span>them, i.e., forms them lower down in the wall than the other niches adjacent to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is a solution, then <span class="gemarra-regular">how could </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four chambers </span>depicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Shimon be constructed? Won’t the niches touch one another? </span>The niches of one chamber will overlap those of the chamber adjacent to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is possible arrange the niches only <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>when constructing the niches of two chambers at opposite ends of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one deepens </span>them, i.e., forms them lower down in the wall than the niches of the other two chambers that are adjacent to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>it is a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one deepens them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said </span>that there is an alternative explanation: It is possible to fashion the <span class="gemarra-regular">four chambers </span>depicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Shimon where one constructs them </span>so that all the niches extend diagonally away from the cavity of the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the leaves of <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm branch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which have spread out from its spine. If formed in this way, the niches of adjacent chambers will not overlap, even if they are at the same depth in the ground.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, is an error, </span>because it is not possible to form all the niches in this way, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the diagonal of every square </span>whose side is <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit is one and two-fifths cubits. </span>Each chamber is eight cubits long, which means that between two adjacent chambers, placed at right angles to each other, there is a square area of eight cubits by eight cubits into which the niches of those two chambers must be formed. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is </span>the diagonal of that area? <span class="gemarra-regular">Eleven and one-fifth cubits. How many niches </span>have to fit in that space? <span class="gemarra-regular">Eight. How can you find </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>niches can possibly fit <span class="gemarra-regular">into eleven and one-fifth cubits? </span>Each of the niches is a cubit wide, and there must be a cubit wall of bedrock between each niche. To accommodate this once would need an area of at least fifteen cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, is in error.</span>
The Gemara provides an alternative solution to the problem of the niches at the corners overlapping. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or if you wish, say as Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said </span>in answer to a similar question: It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborns, </span>which require only very small burial niches. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">here also, </span>the niches at the corners of the chambers were used <span class="gemarra-regular">for non-viable newborns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara considers another mishna that relates to the structure of a catacomb: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Nazir</span> 64b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who finds a corps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> while inspecting a place that was not previously established as a cemetery, to ensure that it is free of ritual impurity, and the corpse is <span class="gemarra-regular">lying in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">usual manner </span>of Jewish burial, <span class="gemarra-regular">he removes it </span>from there <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also removes <span class="gemarra-regular">its surrounding </span>earth. And similarly, if he finds <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>corpses buried in the usual manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he removes them and their surrounding </span>earth. Since only one or two corpses were found, it may be assumed that the area is not a cemetery; therefore, the corpses may be removed. 

Daf 102a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">he found thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> corpses lying parallel to each other, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is between them, </span>i.e., the outer two corpses, a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four to eigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> cubits, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>presumed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a graveyard </span>and the corpses may not be removed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">examin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from that </span>spot <span class="gemarra-regular">outward twenty cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to discover whether there are other corpses buried there. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">finds </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits, he </span>must continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">examine from </span>the place he finds that corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">outward </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits. </span>He continues to search for additional corpses, even if only one corpse was found within the twenty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is a basis for </span>anticipating <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter; </span>it is probable that he has stumbled upon an ancient cemetery. He is not permitted to relocate the corpses, despite that fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he had found </span>the single corpse by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">at first, </span>without being aware of the gravesite, he would have been permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it and its surrounding </span>earth.
The Gemara analyzes that mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>If there is between them a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of four to eight </span>cubits, then it is presumed to be a graveyard. The reason is that corpses buried in this manner are indicative of the standard layout of a burial chamber. The fact that this is said only when the distance between the corpses is between four and eight cubits assumes that the size of a burial chamber is four cubits by eight cubits. Based on this, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>in the mishna above (100b), <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t they say </span>that the size of a burial chamber is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by six </span>cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say </span>that a burial cave is <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by eight </span>cubits?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, and it is </span>in accordance with another version of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, which is cited by <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one found </span>three corpses lying <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>close <span class="gemarra-regular">succession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is not</span> a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of four cubits to eight </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>i.e., they are lying closer together, <span class="gemarra-regular">they have </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the requirement to move their <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding </span>earth in which they are buried. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are not </span>considered to be part of <span class="gemarra-regular">a graveyard, </span>since permanent graves are not placed so closely together. Perforce, their corpses were originally buried there on a temporary basis, but then they were never reinterred. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: The </span>corpses in <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle are viewed as if they are not </span>there, i.e., as if they were buried there incidentally, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other </span>corpses thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>to form a graveyard in which corpses are found with a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of four cubits to eight </span>cubits between them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which opinion did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you interpret </span>the mishna? If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of that mishna: If he finds an area of graves, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">examine from there outward twenty cubits </span>to discover whether there are other corpses buried there. Since the burial formation is indicative of burial within a burial chamber of a catacomb, he should continue to investigate the whole area that would be occupied by a catacomb. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>the distance one should be required to examine <span class="gemarra-regular">would be twenty-two </span>cubits, which is the total length of a catacomb, i.e., two chambers of eight cubits with a courtyard of six cubits between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>the distance one should be required to examine <span class="gemarra-regular">would be eighteen </span>cubits, as each catacomb consists of two chambers of six cubits long with a chamber of six cubits between them.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>it is necessary to examine twenty cubits in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he examined along the diagona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of the catacomb, which is longer than its length.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since </span>he examined <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>chamber along <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diagonal, this </span>second chamber on the other side of the courtyard should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be examined along <span class="gemarra-regular">the diagonal. </span>If so, that <span class="gemarra-regular">would be twenty-two </span>cubits. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We say </span>he should examine <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>chamber along <span class="gemarra-regular">the diagonal, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>he should examine <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>chambers along <span class="gemarra-regular">the diagonal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 102b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: Actually, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, and here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the corpses found were of <span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> buried in a smaller chamber only six cubits long. Adding a courtyard of six cubits and another regular-sized chamber of eight cubits yields a total length of the catacomb of twenty cubits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since this </span>is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a chamber that was created for burying <span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborns,</span> there too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>chamber, on the other side of the courtyard, we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a chamber created for <span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborns as well. </span>Therefore, the total length of the catacomb <span class="gemarra-regular">would be eighteen </span>cubits. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We say </span>that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the chambers is <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborns, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>chambers might have been constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">for non-viable newborns.</span>
§ Above, the Gemara cited a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that relates a dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis with regard to three corpses buried close together. The Rabbis hold that this is not considered a graveyard, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that it can be. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis against </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, and it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon against </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 5:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard that is planted on</span> an area where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits </span>of open space between the vines, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: It is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard</span> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, as it is overcrowded. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, and </span>the reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle </span>vines are <span class="gemarra-regular">viewed as if </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. Therefore, it is prohibited to plant other crops anywhere in that area.
The ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>in this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span> the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as there the Rabbis did not say: The middle ones are viewed as if they are not there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon </span>in this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as there he did say: The corpses in the middle are viewed as if they are not there.
The Gemara answers: The fact that one ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon </span>is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the other ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. There, </span>with regard to vineyards, Rabbi Shimon holds that middle vines cannot be disregarded, as <span class="gemarra-regular">people do not plant </span>vines <span class="gemarra-regular">with the intention of uprooting </span>them. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to burial, <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it happen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that one has to bury a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">at twilight </span>just before the onset of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and indiscriminately inters </span>the body between other corpses with the intention of reburying it at a later date.
Similarly, the fact that one ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the other ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>with regard to burial, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is a disgrac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to bury bodies so close together, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not called </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">graves. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to vineyards, the owner of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever of </span>the vines <span class="gemarra-regular">will flourish, will flourish </span>and I will leave them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>whichever ones <span class="gemarra-regular">do not flourish, </span>I will uproot them and <span class="gemarra-regular">they will be for firewood.</span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If one says to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">eart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of the size <span class="gemarra-regular">required for sowing one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>on that plot <span class="gemarra-regular">there were crevices </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">neka’im</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are not measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. Rather, the buyer must be provided with land measuring a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> exclusive of those crevices or rocks. If the crevices or rocks measured <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: I am selling you a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if there </span>on that plot <span class="gemarra-regular">there were crevices deeper than ten handbreadths or rocks higher than ten handbreadths, they are measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 25a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates his </span>ancestral <span class="gemarra-regular">fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">during the time </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Jubilee </span>Year are practiced, if he wishes to redeem the field <span class="gemarra-regular">he must give </span>the Temple treasurer <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty silver shekels for </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is fit for sowing a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥomer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of barley </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is the biblical equivalent of a <span class="it-text">kor</span>, for all the years of the Jubilee cycle, as this is the sum fixed by the Torah for this purpose (see Leviticus 27:16). But if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crevice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths deep there, </span>in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">or rocks ten handbreadths high, </span>

Daf 103a

<span class="gemarra-regular">they are not measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. If the crevices or rocks were <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>are the crevices that are deeper and the rocks that are higher than ten handbreadths not measured with the rest of the field? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let them </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">be consecrated separatel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and require their own redemption. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that since they are not </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they cannot be consecrated, </span>there is a difficulty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning the verse: “And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it” (Leviticus 27:19): <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse state </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“field”? </span>Since the previous verses are all discussing a field, it would have sufficed for this verse to refer to the field with the pronoun: It. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in an earlier verse: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it; <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥomer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver” </span>(Leviticus 27:16), <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated in this manner,</span> i.e., an area fit to sow a <span class="it-text">ḥomer</span> of barley seed.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do I learn that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is also meant <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the case of one who consecrated a smaller area, e.g., an area fit to sow <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">letekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a half-<span class="it-text">kor</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">letekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>From where is it derived that these smaller plots of land can also be consecrated and redeemed in accordance with the fixed values stated in the Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “A field,” </span>teaching that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case </span>of a field, even to smaller plots.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here, </span>in the mishna in <span class="it-text">Arakhin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with crevices filled with water. </span>Being <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are not fit for sowing, </span>they cannot be consecrated, as the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it” (Leviticus 27:16). The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> about crevices that are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to rocks, </span>which are certainly not fit for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that this explanation is correct.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>that the crevices and rocks of the mishna are excluded from being consecrated because they are unfit for sowing, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if they <span class="gemarra-regular">are less than </span>ten handbreadths in depth or height, they <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>should not be consecrated. The Gemara answers: If the crevices or rocks are less than ten handbreadths deep or high, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>crevices <span class="gemarra-regular">are called the cracks of the earth, </span>and these rocks <span class="gemarra-regular">are called the spines [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shidrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the earth. </span>In other words, since they are considered standard features of the field and do not constitute separate areas, they are consecrated together with the rest of the field.
The Gemara asks: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated above was taught with regard to consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of a sale of land, with regard to which the mishna teaches that crevices ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does that <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apply only when the crevices are filled with water? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Even if they are not filled with water </span>they are not considered part of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that in the case of a sale crevices are not considered part of the field even if they are not filled with water? Because <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>buying a field <span class="gemarra-regular">does not wan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to give his money for </span>the purchase of <span class="gemarra-regular">one plot when it appears to him like two or three </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">plots </span>due to differences in the height of the terrain. Therefore, those crevices that are ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the rest of the field, regardless of whether or not they are filled with water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina objects to this: But </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rocks </span>discussed in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as rocks are not fit for sowing, so too, these </span>crevices are such <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are not fit for sowing. </span>But if they are not filled with water, and are therefore fit for sowing, then even if they are lower than the rest of the field, they should be included in the sale. The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rock</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> discussed in the mishna, it teaches about crevices that <span class="gemarra-regular">are less than that, </span>i.e., less than ten handbreadths deep. In such a case, even if they are not fit for sowing, they are measured along with the rest of the field.
§ The mishna teaches that if the crevices or rocks in the field measured <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The rocks </span>or crevices that measure less than ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>are measured together with the rest of the field must not measure more than <span class="gemarra-regular">an area required for sowing four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed within an area required for sowing a <span class="it-text">kor</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says: This applies </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the rocks <span class="gemarra-regular">are scattered throughout an area required for sowing five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This applies </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the rocks <span class="gemarra-regular">are scattered throughout the greater part of the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba raises a dilemma </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of </span>the rocks are scattered <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the smaller par</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the minority</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the rocks are scattered <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the greater part </span>of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>

Daf 103b

If the rocks are scattered throughout the greater part of the field but are arranged <span class="gemarra-regular">like a ring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

The Gemara states: All these dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> unresolved.
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is a solitary rock </span>on the outskirts of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal </span>size, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>further, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>that rock <span class="gemarra-regular">is adjacent to the </span>field’s <span class="gemarra-regular">border</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if it is of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal </span>size, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not measured </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the rest of the field. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">earth intervene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between </span>the rock and the border of the field, so that the rock does not actually touch the border, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara states: This dilemma as well <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If there was a layer of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth below and rock above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or earth above and rock below, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara states: This dilemma as well <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>him even <span class="gemarra-regular">the slightest amount less </span>than what was stipulated, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduct </span>the difference from the purchase price of the field and return money to the buyer.

If the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than that </span>amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must make a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">calculation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the party that suffered a loss must be compensated.
If the buyer received too much land, so that he must now compensate the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he return to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> He returns <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>i.e., he pays the seller for the surplus land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the seller so <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>the surplus <span class="gemarra-regular">land to him. Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he returns money to him? </span>They said this <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to enhance the power of the seller, </span>and enable him to demand payment for the surplus land, rather than accept its return. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if the surplus </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the field was an area required for sowing nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in a garde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an area required for sowing a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or, according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva, an area required for sowing a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed (see 11a), the buyer must <span class="gemarra-regular">return the land </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> if the surplus is greater than a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not only the quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that he returns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rather, </span>he returns <span class="gemarra-regular">all of the surplus. </span>Since he is already required to make a refund, the refund must be made in the precise amount.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna considers two cases of selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> of land: First, where the seller said that he is selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> measured precisely with a rope, in which case a refund must be made no matter how small the deviation; and second, where the seller said that he selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> more or less, in which case the sale is valid as long as the deviation is no more than a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. In connection with these cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one says he is selling <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of land, and he said this <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>any further <span class="gemarra-regular">specification, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from what was taught in the mishna: If one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope, </span>

Daf 104a

and he gave him even <span class="gemarra-regular">the slightest amount less </span>that what was stipulated, the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduct </span>the difference from the purchase price of the field and return money to the buyer. If he gave him even <span class="gemarra-regular">the slightest amount more </span>than what was stipulated, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">must return </span>the difference to the seller. The reason that even the slightest difference in value must be returned is that the seller specified that he was selling land measured precisely with a rope. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>had he sold the land <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">specification, </span>it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>he sold it saying that it is a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument by proposing another, completely opposite proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer that he is selling him a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> of land <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he gave </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less </span>than what was stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he gave him one-quarter of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more </span>than what was stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his </span>and the sale is valid. One can infer: The reason that the sale is valid is that he specified that he was selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> of land more or less. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>had he sold the land <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">specification, </span>it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>he sold it saying that he was selling the land <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope. Rather, </span>since the mishna can be interpreted in two opposite ways, <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>inference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be learned from </span>the mishna.
The Gemara tries to present another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the seller said to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>or he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth about </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>or he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less; </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he gave </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less </span>than what was stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he gave him one-quarter of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than what was stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his </span>and the sale is valid. One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> of land <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">specification </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also like </span>selling it <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less. </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is explaining </span>his statement, which should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">When is </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> treated like the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the buyer: I am selling you a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi objects to this: If that is so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need to repeat the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you, </span>three times? The fact that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> repeats these words in each clause indicates that it is discussing three separate sale transactions, and not that the three clauses are all referring to one case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that selling a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> of land <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">specificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>selling it <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is so.
§ With regard to a buyer who received too much land and now must compensate the seller, the mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he return to him? </span>He pays him <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>and if the seller so wishes, the buyer returns the surplus land to him, because the Sages said that the buyer pays money in order to enhance the power of the seller. In other words, the Sages allowed the seller to choose whether to take back the surplus land or to demand payment for it from the buyer, even though this effectively forces the buyer to purchase the surplus land from him. The Gemara asks: Is it correct that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller’s power should be enhanced, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer’s power should be enhanced?</span>
But <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>otherwise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">seven and a half </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less </span>than what was stipulated, which is the equivalent of a quarter<span class="it-text">-kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, as a <span class="it-text">kor</span> is equal to thirty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he gave him seven and a half </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more </span>than what was stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his </span>and the sale is valid. If the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>amount, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">compels the seller to sel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the buyer to buy </span>the difference. This indicates that we also say that the buyer’s power should be enhanced, since if the buyer so wishes, the seller is compelled to sell him land and accept payment for it.
The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not discussing a case where the buyer wishes to acquire the surplus land, but rather with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was initially, </span>at the time of the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">expensive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but now it is cheap, </span>and the seller wants the buyer to pay him for the surplus land according to the initial higher rate. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say to </span>the seller, in the name of the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you </span>wish to <span class="gemarra-regular">give me lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and receive money, <span class="gemarra-regular">give me </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the current, cheaper rate. </span>This is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to when it states that the seller is compelled to sell.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When he gives him </span>money in payment for the surplus land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him according to the rate at which he had bought </span>the rest of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was initially chea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but now it is expensive. </span>If, in such a case, the seller wants the buyer to pay him for the surplus land, he is compelled to sell it to him according to the cheap rate from the time of the original sale.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if the surplus in the field was an area required for the sowing of nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, and in a garden an area required for the sowing of a half-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed, or, according to the Rabbi Akiva, an area required for the sowing of a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed, the buyer can return the surplus land to the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that was stated </span>in the mishna, that a surplus in the size of an area required for the sowing of <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed can be returned to the seller, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even in a large valley</span> which measures several <span class="it-text">kor</span>. If the surplus is a significant plot of land equal in size to an area required for the sowing of nine <span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed, the buyer can return it to the seller, even if it is less than one-quarter of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, i.e., less than one twenty-fourth the size of the field that was sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says: He calculates seven and a half </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is equivalent to one-quarter of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. As long as the surplus does not exceed that ratio, he is not required to return it, even if the surplus is greater than the area required for the sowing of nine <span class="it-text">kav</span>. 

Daf 104b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>after this calculation <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">a surplu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in excess of a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, equal in size to an area required <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sowing of <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the entire surplus must be <span class="gemarra-regular">returned.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman: </span>The mishna teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that if the surplus in the fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was an area required for the sowing of nine </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of seed, the buyer returns the land to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him </span>a field measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This would seem to indicate that even if the surplus does not exceed a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, as a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span> in a field of two <span class="it-text">kor</span> is fifteen <span class="it-text">kav</span>, the sole determining factor is whether or not the surplus is equal in size to an area required for the sowing of nine <span class="it-text">kav</span>. Rav Naḥman rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the case in the mishna is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him a </span>field measuring one <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rava raised a further objection to Rav Naḥman: We learned in the continuation of the mishna that if the surplus <span class="gemarra-regular">in a garden </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">an area required for the sowing of a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> of seed, the buyer returns the land to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him </span>a garden measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Once again, this would seem to indicate that the surplus is returned to the seller, provided that it is equal in size to the minimum measure of a garden, even if the surplus does not exceed one-half of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> per two <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, which is equivalent to one-quarter of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. Rav Naḥman rejects this argument as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the case in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him a </span>garden measuring a <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so that the surplus is proportionately twice as large.
Rava raised yet another objection to Rav Naḥman from the next clause in the mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva, </span>if the surplus in the garden was <span class="gemarra-regular">an area required for sowing a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed, </span>the buyer returns the land to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, isn’t this </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him a </span>garden measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>In that case, the surplus does not exceed one-quarter of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, and nevertheless the surplus is returned to the seller, provided that it is equal in size to the minimum measure of a garden. Rav Naḥman also rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the case in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he sold him </span>a garden measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the surplus is proportionately twice as large.
The mishna teaches that in the case of a field, the buyer can return the land itself if the surplus was an area required for the sowing of nine <span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed, and in the case of a garden, if the surplus was an area required for the sowing of a half-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of seed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises a dilemma: </span>If one sold <span class="gemarra-regular">a field and it </span>turned out that the plot was larger than had been stipulated, but before the buyer returned the surplus, the plot <span class="gemarra-regular">was turned into a garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>if it was initially <span class="gemarra-regular">a garden and it was turned into a fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> (see 11a), <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the surplus governed by the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> applying to a field or by those applying to a garden? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved, as no answer has been found.
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the field being sold <span class="gemarra-regular">was adjacent to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">field </span>belonging to the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">then even </span>if the surplus was of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal </span>amount, the buyer can <span class="gemarra-regular">return the land </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. This is because the seller loses nothing when he receives a small tract of land, as he can cultivate it along with his adjoining field.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises </span>a set of <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemmas: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit</span> between the surplus in the sold field and the adjoining field belonging to the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition </span>between the two fields? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel </span>between the two fields, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should </span>the water channel <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public thoroughfare, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should </span>the public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a row of palm trees, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should </span>a row of palm trees <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition? </span>The Gemara states: All these dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that if the surplus is greater than a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not only the quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">returns; rather, </span>he returns <span class="gemarra-regular">all of the surplus. </span>Since he is already required to make a refund, the refund must be made in the precise amount. The Gemara raises a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it the opposite </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">kelappei layya</span>]? The buyer is required to return the surplus even when the quarters of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> remain in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin bar Rav Naḥman taught </span>the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not only must </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">return the extra </span>land that is beyond the limit of a quarter<span class="it-text">-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> area per <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he must </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">return to him every one of the </span>extra <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">kav</span> areas of land that he received beyond the stated area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>. When he is required to return the surplus, he returns not only the surplus, but also all the quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> areas over and above what had originally been stipulated to be included in the sale.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the seller says to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you </span>a plot of land of a certain size <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope more or less, </span>thereby attaching to the sale two contradictory stipulations; in this case, the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">More or less, nullify </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope. </span>Accordingly, if the surplus did not exceed a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> per <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, the sale is valid as is. Similarly, if the seller says to the buyer: I am selling you a plot of land of a certain size <span class="gemarra-regular">more or less measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope, </span>

Daf 105a

the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Measured </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope, nullify </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">More or less, </span>since the principle is that in all cases, one should attend to the final expression; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of ben Nanas.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Ben Nanas’s colleagues disagree with him </span>with regard to his ruling that one should attend to the final expression. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>new <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>Don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>that they disagree from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 102a): There was once <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> involving one who rented a bathhouse from another, </span>and it was stated that the rental fee would be <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve gold dinars </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zehuvim</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one gold </span>dinar <span class="gemarra-regular">per month, </span>and the year was later intercalated, an extra month being added.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The incident came before Rabban Shimon ben Gamlie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and before Rabbi Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> for a decision as to whether the intercalated month is included in the words: Twelve gold dinars a year, or whether an additional payment must be made for that month, as the agreement stipulated: One gold dinar per month. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they said: </span>The landlord and the tenant <span class="gemarra-regular">should divide the intercalated month </span>between them, and so the tenant should pay only half a gold dinar for it. This indicates that these Sages ruled that the meaning of an agreement containing two contradictory expressions is in doubt, and therefore the parties divide the disputed amount between them. From here it follows that they disagree with the opinion of ben Nanas, who says that in such a case one should attend to the final expression.
The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the Sages’ opinion was derived only <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>I would not know that they disagree with the opinion of ben Nanas in all cases, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I would sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>that the Sages say that the parties divide the disputed sum between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is possible to say that </span>the landlord <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>his first statement and set the rental fee at one gold dinar per month, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">possible to say that he is explaining </span>his earlier statement. That is to say, he did not mean to relate to the intercalated month; rather, he was clarifying that payment was to be made not with a lump sum at the end of the year, but in monthly installments. Since there is uncertainty with regard to his intention, the parties divide the contested sum between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here </span>in the mishna, where the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly retracted </span>his first statement, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> that the Sages do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>disagree with ben Nanas. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that in all cases the Sages disagree with ben Nanas.
Similar to what was cited above in the name of Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: This is the statement of ben Nanas, </span>who says with regard to a case of contradictory expressions that one should attend to the final expression; <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Sages say: Follow the least inclusive expression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one that is the least advantageous to the buyer, in keeping with the principle that in a case of uncertainty, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel mean to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the statement of ben Nanas, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he, Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not agree with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But don’t Rav and Shmuel both say:</span> If the seller said to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of grain, an amount equivalent to thirty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can renege </span>on the entire sale <span class="gemarra-regular">even while </span>measuring out <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the seller stipulated that he was selling a full <span class="it-text">kor</span> of grain, as long as he has not yet measured out the full amount, he may still renege, as the sale is not yet complete.
But if the seller said to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">for thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, each <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one by on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as it is being measured out to him. Since the seller specified the price per <span class="it-text">sela</span>, he has indicated that he is ready to sell each <span class="it-text">sela</span> on its own. This seems to indicate that Shmuel maintains that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should attend to the final expression. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Shmuel’s formulation: This is the statement of ben Nanas, must be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is the statement of ben Nanas, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees with him </span>that one should attend to the final expression.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does </span>Shmuel actually <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with him? But doesn’t Shmuel say: </span>Concerning the ruling of the Sages that the landlord and the tenant should divide the intercalated month between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the landlord <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to collect the rent <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle of the month. </span>Only in that case is the disputed rent divided between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he came </span>to collect the rent <span class="gemarra-regular">at the beginning of the month, the entire </span>sum goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the landlord </span>who is demanding payment, since he is in possession of the property. And if he came <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of the month, the entire</span> sum goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the tenant </span>who is refusing payment, since he is in possession of the money. This indicates that Shmuel maintains that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should not attend to the latter expression. Rather, the case is viewed as one of uncertainty, and the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. 

Daf 105b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>meant to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the statement of ben Nanas, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not agree with him </span>that one should attend to the latter expression. In fact, he is in agreement with the Sages who maintain that two contradictory expressions create a case of uncertainty. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there, </span>in the case of the rent for the intercalated month, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason</span> for his ruling that if the landlord came to collect the rent at the beginning of the month, the entire sum goes to the landlord, whereas if he came at the end of the month, the money goes to the tenant? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>the party who is awarded the money <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>seen as already being <span class="gemarra-regular">in possession </span>of it, and in a case of uncertainty, money is left in the hands of the party enjoying possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case where the seller says that he is selling a <span class="it-text">kor</span> of grain for thirty <span class="it-text">sela</span>, each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> for a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, the buyer was seen as already being <span class="gemarra-regular">in possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> that was measured out to him, and therefore the seller cannot renege on the sale. It is for this reason that the buyer acquires the grain, and not because of the principle that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should attend to the latter expression.
On a similar topic, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rav: </span>If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you this item for <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">istera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an <span class="it-text">istera</span> being a silver coin equal to ninety-six copper <span class="it-text">ma’a</span>, it is assumed he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>And if the seller reversed the order and said that he was selling the item for <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">istera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is assumed he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">istera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>new <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>Is it that with regard to a statement comprised of contradictory expressions <span class="gemarra-regular">one should attend </span>only to <span class="gemarra-regular">the last statement? Didn’t Rav </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">say this </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">another occasion? As Rav says: Had I been there </span>as a judge when the ruling was issued with regard to the rental fee for the intercalated month, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have given the entire </span>month’s rent <span class="gemarra-regular">to the landlord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> based on the final expression in the rental agreement: One gold dinar per month.
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it was necessary to state both rulings, as the one cannot necessarily be inferred from the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">If this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">istera</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated and that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the intercalated month <span class="gemarra-regular">was not stated, I would say </span>that when the seller uttered the second expression: One hundred <span class="it-text">ma’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> first expression: An <span class="it-text">istera</span>, as the two expressions contradict one another, and for that reason Rav said that one should attend to the final expression. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here,</span> in the case of the intercalated month, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps you </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that when the landlord utters the second expression: One gold dinar per month, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is explaining </span>the original intent of his first expression: Twelve gold dinars a year, and one should view it as a clarification. Therefore Rav comes and <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in all cases one should attend to the final expression. 

Daf 106a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one sells a field to another, telling him that he is selling him a field measuring a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">with its </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">demarcations and border</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that the seller specifies for the buyer, the field’s measurement is not treated in as exacting a manner as in a standard sale. Therefore, if it later turns out that the field was not precisely a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>, but the difference is still <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the buyer’s, and the sale is valid as is. But if the difference is greater, e.g., one-quarter or one-fifth, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>it is calculated at <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the difference from the purchase price and return money to the buyer.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the following issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says:</span> A difference that is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth is like </span>one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth, </span>and the sale is valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>A difference that is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth is like </span>one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, </span>and the difference must be deducted from the purchase price.
The Gemara explains the respective reasons of the two <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that a difference of <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth is like </span>a difference of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth, and including </span>a difference that is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, it is </span>the buyer’s, as the sale is valid, and if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduct </span>the difference from the purchase price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that a difference of <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth is like </span>a difference of <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying:</span> If the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth, it is </span>the buyer’s, as the sale is valid, and if the difference is greater, <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>it is calculated at <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, and including </span>a difference that is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduct </span>the difference from the purchase price.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Huna’s statement from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one sells a field to another, telling him that he is selling him a field measuring a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">within its </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">demarcations and borders, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>him a field that is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth less </span>than the measure stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or, </span>alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>him a field that is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth more </span>than the measure stipulated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like </span>a sale of orphans’ property that is executed in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the judges’ assessmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of the value of that property, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>the buyer’s, as the sale is valid. The Gemara states the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of a sale executed in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the judges’ assessment, </span>an error of precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth is like </span>an error of <span class="gemarra-regular">more than one-sixth, </span>and the sale is void. This contradicts Rav Huna’s opinion that an error of one-sixth is like an error of less than one-sixth.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in reply: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your reasoning, </span>there is still a difficulty, since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>the buyer’s, i.e., the sale is final. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the comparison drawn between this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and the judges’ assessment is not a general comparison. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the judges’ assessment, but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">like the judges’ assessment. </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the judges’ assessment </span>in that the limit is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but it is not like the judges’ assessment, as there, </span>in the case of the judges’ assessment, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sale is voided, while here, </span>in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>the buyer’s, and the sale is final.
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa bought land from a certain man, </span>

Daf 106b

who, after specifying its demarcations and boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">griv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning that it is fit for planting twenty <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of grain. Rav Pappa later <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>found that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>fit for planting <span class="gemarra-regular">only fiftee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Abaye </span>to sue the seller. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You knew </span>what you were buying <span class="gemarra-regular">and accepted </span>the field as is.
Rav Pappa raised an objection to Abaye’s ruling from the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that when the seller specifies the field’s demarcations and borders, if the difference between the stated size of the field and its actual size is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than one-sixth, </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the buyer’s, and the sale is valid as is, but if the difference is greater, <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>it is calculated at <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixth, </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must deduct </span>the difference from the purchase price? And here, in this case, the difference between what the seller promised and the actual size of the field is greater than one-sixth. Abaye replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">That statement</span> applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">is unfamiliar with </span>the plot being sold to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is familiar with it, he knew </span>what he was buying <span class="gemarra-regular">and accepted </span>it as is.
Rav Pappa raised another objection to Abaye’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">me</span> that the field is fit for planting <span class="gemarra-regular">twent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, and it is not. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>What he meant was <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>and as fruitful <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one that is fit for planting <span class="gemarra-regular">twent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers divide </span>their father’s estate between them by lottery, i.e., after dividing the property into equal shares they draw lots to determine which brother is to receive which portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">once the lot for one of them is drawn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they all acquire </span>the remainder of the property, and they can no longer retract their decision to divide the estate in this manner. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for this? Drawing lots is not one of the recognized modes of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies here is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the initial </span>division of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael </span>among the tribes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the initial </span>division of Eretz Yisrael was carried out <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>drawing <span class="gemarra-regular">lots, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>the brothers can divide their father’s estate <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>drawing <span class="gemarra-regular">lots.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the brothers’ division of their father’s estate is comparable to the initial division of Eretz Yisrael, an additional comparison should apply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the initial division of Eretz Israel was carried out <span class="gemarra-regular">through a receptacle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekalpi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in which lots were placed <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too here, </span>the division of the father’s estate should be executed only <span class="gemarra-regular">through a receptacle and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi said: With the satisfaction </span>that each of the brothers receives from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they listen to each othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and agree to accept the results of the lottery, <span class="gemarra-regular">they fully transfer </span>ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">to each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the division becomes final as soon as the first lot is drawn.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about a related issue: If <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers divided </span>their father’s estate between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then later a third <span class="gemarra-regular">brother, </span>of whose existence they had previously been unaware, <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived from a country overseas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav says: The </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the brothers must now redivide the property among the three of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>The original division is still valid, but the two brothers must each <span class="gemarra-regular">take off a shar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from their portion and give it to the third brother.
The Gemara clarifies the opinions of Rav and Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to Rav, who says that the division is void, apparently </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if a division of property was found to have been performed in error, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict is reconsidered </span>and the entire division is void. Accordingly, in the case of the brother who arrived from overseas, the original division of the father’s estate is void. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, </span>then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">these thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">who stand </span>as partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two of them go and divide </span>the property into three parts without consulting with the third partner, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the division should be void, </span>and it should be necessary to divide the property a second time between the three partners. But elsewhere (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 31b), the Gemara indicates that in such a case, if the division of property took place in the presence of a court, it is valid.
Rav Naḥman rejects this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span>There is a clear difference between them: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the three partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">they entered </span>the process of dividing the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset with the knowledge that they were three</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it was necessary only to clarify the portion to be received by each partner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the brother who arrived from overseas, <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not enter </span>the process of dividing the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset with the knowledge that they were three, </span>as at the time of the original division, they thought that there were only two brothers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> According to Shmuel, who says </span>that the two brothers must each <span class="gemarra-regular">take off a share </span>from their portion and give it to the third brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">is this to say that </span>he is of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>even if a division of property was found to have been made in error, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and the division is valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t Rav and Shmuel both say </span>that if the seller said to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of grain, an amount equivalent to thirty <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can renege </span>on the entire sale <span class="gemarra-regular">even while </span>measuring out <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>but if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">for thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>each <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one </span>as it is being measured out to him? If the original verdict stands, why in the first case may the seller renege even on that portion of the sale that already reached the buyer? 

Daf 107a

The Gemara answers: The cases cannot be compared because <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the sale of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages instituted a matter that is suitable for the seller and</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for the buyer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the price of grain fluctuates, neither party wants the sale to be considered complete until the last <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is measured out, so that they each are able to renege on the sale should the price rise or fall. This reasoning does not apply in cases of division of property.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> disagreed about another related matter: If <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers divided </span>their father’s estate between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor came and took the portion of one of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> as repayment for the father’s debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: The </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the brothers must now redivide the remaining assets. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>Each brother, upon receiving his portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">has foregone </span>his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: </span>The brother whose portion was seized is entitled to half the remaining inheritance: <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes one-quarter in land and one-quarter in money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains the rationale for each opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is void. </span>This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds that brothers who divided </span>property received as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>still considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs</span> with regard to the inheritance as if they never divided the property, so that they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Therefore, if a creditor seizes the portion received by one of them, it is as if he repaid the debt on behalf of all the heirs. Accordingly, they must once again divide the remaining property between them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that each brother, upon receiving his portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">has foregone </span>his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divided </span>property received as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from each other. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>each one is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a purchaser </span>who bought his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee </span>that if the field is seized in payment of a debt, the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss. Accordingly, the brother whose portion of the estate was seized by the creditor has no claim against the brother whose portion remained untouched.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi is uncertain whether </span>brothers who divided property received as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>still considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs or are </span>considered to be like <span class="gemarra-regular">purchasers </span>who bought their property with a guarantee of compensation should the property be repossessed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>the brother whose portion was seized by the creditor is entitled to half the remaining inheritance, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes one-quarter in land </span>like an heir <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-quarter </span>he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">in money, </span>like a purchaser with a guarantee, who is compensated with money for his loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in all </span>the cases dealt with in <span class="gemarra-regular">these statements </span>recording disagreements between Rav and Shmuel is that the brothers must each <span class="gemarra-regular">take off a shar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from their portion in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. Rather, any brother currently in possession of his portion must give part of it to his brother who lacks a portion, so that in the end they have equal shares. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in all of these cases is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is void, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rav. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>in fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 11:2): In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>experts <span class="gemarra-regular">who went down to assess </span>a certain property in order to determine the amount to be collected from it for repayment of a debt, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">two say </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">two say </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred, </span>the assessment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the single </span>expert <span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified, since </span>his is <span class="gemarra-regular">the minority </span>opinion, and the assessment of the two others is accepted.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one says</span> the property is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars, and another says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which is equivalent to eighty dinars, since four dinars equal a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">another says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>, which is equivalent to one hundred and twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is assessed at one hundred dinars, </span>which is the average of the assessments, as it is equivalent to twenty-five <span class="it-text">sela</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: It is assessed at ninety </span>dinars, as will be explained below. <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: An appraisal </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>of the sum <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two most extreme assessments <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divided by three. </span>This sum is then added to the lowest assessment.
The Gemara clarifies the various opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is assessed at one hundred dinars </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">the middl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the two extreme assessments is followed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is assessed at ninety </span>dinars because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds that this land</span>

Daf 107b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">worth ninet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which is equivalent to eighty dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, </span>i.e., too low, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">ahead, </span>i.e., too high. Therefore, the average of these two assessments is followed.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary,</span> say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this land is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one hundred and ten </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, and the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which is equivalent to one hundred and twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">ahead. </span>If so, the average of these two assessments, one hundred and ten dinars, should be followed. The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, grasp the first two </span>assessments <span class="gemarra-regular">in your hand, as neither </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the assessment <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the sum of one hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an appraisal </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>of the sum <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span> the two most extreme assessments <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divided by three. </span>This sum is then added to the lowest assessment. The Gemara explains this opinion: <span class="it-text">Aḥerim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this land is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">worth ninety-three and one-third </span>dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, the equivalent of eighty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-third behind, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says it is </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-third ahead. By right, </span>that assessor <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said more, </span>i.e., quoted a higher sum, since according to this calculation, he should have said it is worth one hundred and six and two-thirds dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not </span>do so is that he <span class="gemarra-regular">thinks </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is enough that I add this muc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> above </span>and beyond the assessment of <span class="gemarra-regular">my colleague </span>who says it is worth eighty dinars. Therefore, he lowers the sum of his assessment to one hundred dinars.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this land is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one hundred and thirteen </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-third, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-third behind, and the one who says </span>it is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which is equal to one hundred and twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">errs </span>with an assessment that is <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and one-third ahead.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>When one sells half of his field to another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer takes the leaner </span><span class="gemarra-regular">par</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the field, the part that is of lower quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">an assessment is made </span>of the field, which is then divided <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>which indicates that the buyer and the seller are given similar parcels of land? How then can you say that the buyer takes the leaner part? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in a sarcastic manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">While you were eating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia </span>and neglecting your studies, <span class="gemarra-regular">we explained </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">based on the latter clause </span>of the mishna, which proves that my understanding is correct.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As the latter clause teaches: </span>If the seller says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am selling you the half that is on the southern side </span>of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">an assessment is made </span>of the northern and the southern sides of the field, which is then divided <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, and he takes the half on the southern side. </span>If taken literally, this passage gives rise to a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why is an assessment made </span>of the northern and the southern sides of the field, which is then divided <span class="gemarra-regular">between them? </span>In any case, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t he say to him </span>that he is selling him <span class="gemarra-regular">the southern half? </span>Let the seller give the buyer the southern half of the field. Why is an assessment necessary? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the matter is more complicated than it seems, and the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is to say, the buyer takes the southern half, but the seller must reimburse him with money for the difference in value between the two halves of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the first case, the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to money:</span> The buyer takes the leaner half, but the seller must reimburse him with money for the difference in value between the two halves of the field.
§ The mishna teaches that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>to provide out of his own property <span class="gemarra-regular">the space for the fence </span>between the two halves of the field and for the larger and smaller ditches. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The larger <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch </span>is dug <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, while the smaller ditch </span>is dug <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside,</span> closer to the field. Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>are dug <span class="gemarra-regular">behind the fence, </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">so that an animal will not jum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> over the fence, enter the field, and cause damage. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him make </span>only a larger <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch and not make a smaller ditch. </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the ditch <span class="gemarra-regular">is wide, </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">can stand inside it and jump </span>from there over the fence. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">then let him make </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a smaller ditc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and not make </span>a larger <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch? Since the ditch is small, </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">stands on its edge and jumps </span>over the fence. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains the matter further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>space is there <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the larger <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch and the smaller ditch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One handbreadth.</span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>family members who both <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath </span>to each other upon their respective deaths; <span class="gemarra-regular">and there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>those who <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>from certain relatives <span class="gemarra-regular">but do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath </span>to them; and there are those who <span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath </span>to certain relatives <span class="gemarra-regular">but do not inherit </span>from them; and there are those who, despite being relatives, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">nor bequeath </span>to one another.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by clarifying the order of the list in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different, </span>i.e., what is the reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>with regard to his <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>example? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Sons </span>with regard to their <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>example. The Gemara explains why this would be preferable: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not </span>want to <span class="gemarra-regular">begin with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">calamity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the death of a son during his father’s lifetime is a calamity; therefore, it would have been appropriate to begin with the example of sons inheriting from their father. 

Daf 108b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>the verse first states that a son inherits from his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the portion concerning inheritance: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a man dies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and has no son, </span>then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8).
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna who listed the father inheriting first, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a father inherits from his son <span class="gemarra-regular">is learned through a derivatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">dear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him; </span>therefore, he listed it first.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">derivation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning the verse: “And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall inherit it” (Numbers 27:11): <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the father precedes the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the deceased in inheriting from him. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the father of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precede the son </span>of the deceased in inheriting from him; <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Next [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakkarov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to him,” teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">closer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>one is to the deceased, the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> one is in the order of inheritance, and a son of the deceased is considered to be a closer relative to the deceased than the father of the deceased.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did you see </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to include the son </span>as the closer relative than the father <span class="gemarra-regular">and to exclude the brother? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> include the son, as he stands in place of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father to designat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself, which a brother cannot do. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, he stands in place of his father <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ancestral field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If a son redeems a field consecrated by his father, it is considered as though the father himself redeemed it and the field returns to the family in the Jubilee Year. By contrast, if the brother of the one who consecrated it redeems the field, it does not return to the family (see Leviticus 27:16–21).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, I </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">include the brother</span> as the closer relative, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he stands in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brother’s place with regard to levirate marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and a son does not. The Gemara answers: This is not a valid claim, as <span class="gemarra-regular">is there levirate marriage except in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a case where there is no son? In a case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where there is a son, there is no levirate marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that a son stands in place of the deceased before a brother even with regard to levirate marriage.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that a son is considered to be a closer relative than a brother <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this refutation, </span>that where there is a son there is no levirate marriage. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">without this </span>refutation <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a brother is superior </span>to a son in terms of how close a relative he is. The Gemara therefore asks: Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that a son is closer to the deceased than a brother

Daf 109a

from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that here, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>examples of the superiority of a son, designation and an ancestral field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>demonstration of the superiority of a brother, levirate marriage?
The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ancestral field itself, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establishes his </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">reason: Is there levirate marriage except in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case where there is no son? In a case where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is a son, there is no levirate marriage. </span>The determination that the redemption of the ancestral field by a son is in place of the redemption of the field by the father, whereas the redemption of the field by a brother is not, is based on the reasoning that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of levirate marriage is not an indication that a brother is a closer relative than a son. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an ancestral field cannot be regarded as a second example of the son’s superiority, as it stems from the first example, that of levirate marriage.
The Gemara suggests an alternative derivation: Why should the father of the deceased inherit before only the brothers? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that he should inherit before the daughter of the deceased as well by interpreting the verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman” </span>(Numbers 27:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the father, </span>and the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father precedes the daughter </span>of the deceased in inheriting from him. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the father of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">should precede the son </span>of the deceased in inheriting from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Next [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakkarov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to him,” teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">closer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>one is to the deceased, the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>one is in the order of inheritance.
This suggestion is rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the matter of levirate marriage a son and a daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are equivalent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as levirate marriage is not performed if the deceased had either a son or a daughter, it stands to reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the matter of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inheritance as well, a son and a daughter are equivalen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in that the father does not precede the daughter.
The Gemara suggests an alternative derivation: Why should the father of the deceased inherit before the brothers of the deceased? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that he should inherit only before his own brothers by interpreting the verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>( Numbers 27:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the father, </span>and the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the father precedes the father’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brothers </span>in inheriting from the deceased. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the father of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">should precede the brothers</span> of the deceased in inheriting from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Next [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakkarov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to him,” teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">closer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>one is to the deceased, the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>one is in the order of inheritance.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse is not necessary </span>to teach that the father of the deceased inherits before <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s brothers, </span>for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">By whose virtue do the father’s brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come </span>to inherit from the deceased? <span class="gemarra-regular">By virtue </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>as their right to inherit is a result of their being brothers of the father of the deceased. Could it be that while the <span class="gemarra-regular">father is still alive, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his brothers should inherit? </span>The Gemara therefore concludes that the father precedes the brothers of the deceased.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the verses are not written that way, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: </span>“And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10), and only later is it written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father has no brothers, </span>then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him” (Numbers 27:11), indicating that the father, whose right to inherit is derived from the term “kinsman,” inherits only after the brothers of the deceased and his own brothers. The Gemara explains: The <span class="gemarra-regular">verses are not written in order, </span>since as explained earlier, it is not reasonable that the father’s brothers inherit before the father. Therefore, it must be that the inheritance of the father is not written in its proper place, and he may inherit even before the brothers of the deceased.
§ The Gemara records an additional derivation for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the father precedes the brothers of the deceased. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cites it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, taught this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man dies, and has no son,</span> then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). In the rest of the passage the verse employs the phrase “and you shall give.” It is only in this verse that it employs the phrase “and you shall pass.” Based on this, Rabbi Yishmael teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> case </span>where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, you pass an inheritance</span> to her <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one who appears to have precedence, namely, <span class="gemarra-regular">the father, and </span>by inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not pass </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance from the father in a case </span>where there are <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>of the deceased.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case </span>where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, you pass </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance </span>to her <span class="gemarra-regular">from the brothers, </span>

Daf 109b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but you do not pas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an inheritance from the father even in a case </span>where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, </span>so that the father precedes the daughter in the order of inheritance? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, the Merciful One would not write: “Then you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall pass </span>the inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). This indicates that the logical order of inheritance is being overridden, as the fact that the daughter precedes the brothers of the deceased is due to her being a closer relative of his. It is obvious that the Torah intends that she precede even the father.
Having quoted two derivations for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the father precedes the brothers, the Gemara proceeds to discuss them and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who derives it from </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall pass,” what does he do with this </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman,” </span>which was said to refer to the father? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires it for that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman.” This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife, </span>and the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> husband inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who derives it from </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what does he do with this </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pass”? He requires it for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: In </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the relatives listed in the passage detailing the laws of inheritance, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated concerning them </span>with the terminology of <span class="gemarra-regular">giving, and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the context of daughters, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated concerning them </span>with the terminology of <span class="gemarra-regular">passing. </span>This teaches us <span class="gemarra-regular">that you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no one who passes an inheritance </span>of land in Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">from one tribe to another except for a daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since her son and husband inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her.</span>
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the interpretation of the term: “His kinsman” (Numbers 27:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>does one know to derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>with regard to the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinsman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ero</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the father, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in the context of forbidden sexual relations: <span class="gemarra-regular">“She</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is your father’s kinswoman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’er</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 18:12)? Perhaps one should <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His kinswoman,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the mother, as it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “For she is your mother’s kinswoman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’er</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”</span> (Leviticus 18:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him <span class="gemarra-regular">of his family, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall inherit it” </span>(Numbers 27:11), emphasizing that “kinsman” is referring specifically to someone who is of his family, and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s family </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is called </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family, </span>while one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s famil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family. </span>Proof for this is found in another verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “By their families, by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their fathers’ houses” </span>(Numbers 1:2).
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> family </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">not called </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family? But it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in the episode of Micah forming an idol to be worshipped: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And there was a young man of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bethlehem in Judah of the family of Judah who was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Levite, and he sojourned there” </span>(Judges 17:7). The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter itself </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. You said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Who was a Levite,” </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently he came from </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi, </span>but the verse says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the family of Judah,” </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently he came from </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah. Rather, is it not that his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi and his mother </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah, and </span>yet the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he was: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of the family of Judah”? </span>This appears to prove that one’s mother’s family is also called his family.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Ḥanan said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the verse speaks of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man whose name </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi, </span>but his father was of the tribe of Judah. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which Micah said</span> when that man agreed to serve as his priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Now I know that the Lord will do me good, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seeing that I have a Levite as my priest” </span>(Judges 17:13), understood? It is understood only if he was an actual Levite, not if he was from the tribe of Judah and named Levi. Rava bar Rav Ḥanan responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is understood. Micah understood the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man whose name </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi happened upon hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> as an auspicious sign.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his name </span>was indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi; but wasn’t Jonathan his name, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the Danites” </span>(Judges 18:30)? Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And according to your reasoning, </span>that his name was not Levi but he was from the tribe of Levi, there is also a difficulty from that same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Manasseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but wasn’t he the son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Moses, as it is written: “The sons of Moses: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gershom and Eliezer” </span>(I Chronicles 23:15)?
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan explains the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>although he was the son of Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he acted </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Manasseh </span>the king of Judah, who was notorious for idol worship, <span class="gemarra-regular">acted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse linked him to Manasse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> by calling him “the son of Manasseh.” <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the verse from which you seek to prove that one’s mother’s family is called one’s family, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he acted </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Manasseh, who came from </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah, acted, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse linked him to Judah </span>by stating that he was “of the family of Judah,” but he was, in fact, a Levite.
In connection with this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From here </span>it is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">that corruption is linked to one who is corrupt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this man was linked to Manasseh and Judah despite having no familial connection to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>That concept can be seen <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>in the matter of Adonijah, the son of David: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was also a very handsome man; and she gave birth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him after Absalom,” </span>(I Kings 1:6) <span class="gemarra-regular">but Adonijah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t the son of Haggith and Absalom was the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Maachah, </span>so why does the verse state: “And she gave birth to him after Absalom,” as if they were sons of the same mother? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, since Adonijah acted </span>in a manner fit for <span class="gemarra-regular">Absalom, who </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">rebelled against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the monarchy, the verse linked him to Absalom, </span>referring to him as his full brother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to Jonathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he acted </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Manasseh acted, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse linked him to Manasseh.</span>
§ In connection with the story of Jonathan, son of Manasseh, the Gemara cites a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: A person should always </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cleave to goo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> people, meaning one should marry a woman from a good family, as this is beneficial for the offspring of that marriage. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who married a daughter of Yitro, </span>who was a priest of idolatry, <span class="gemarra-regular">Jonathan, </span>who was also a priest of idolatry, <span class="gemarra-regular">descended from him, </span>while in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who married the daughter of Amminadab, </span>who was of distinguished lineage in the tribe of Judah, <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas descended from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Pinehas not </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">come from Yitro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one of the daughters of Putiel as a wife; </span>and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not</span> stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Pinehas <span class="gemarra-regular">came from </span>the family of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yitro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>was also called Putiel because he <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pittem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] calves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for idol worship? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that he came from Joseph, who battled [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shepitpet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his desire </span>by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> denigrated him </span>after he killed Zimri (see Numbers, chapter 25), <span class="gemarra-regular">and would say </span>of him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have you seen this son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Puti, the son </span>of he <span class="gemarra-regular">whose mother’s father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fattened calves for idol worship? Should </span>such a man <span class="gemarra-regular">kill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a prince of a tribe of Israel? </span>

Daf 110a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is how the matter should be resolved: <span class="gemarra-regular">If his mother’s fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> came <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the family of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph, his mother’s mother </span>came <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the family of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yitro, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if his mother’s father</span> came <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the family of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yitro, his mother’s mother</span> came <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the family of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph, </span>so while his mother was descended from Joseph on one side and from Yitro on the other, Pinehas was a more distant relative to Yitro than Jonathan was. Based on this conclusion, the language of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: </span>“And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters of Putiel” </span>(Exodus 6:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the wording of the verse that Pinehas was descended from <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> men who were referred to as Puti: Yitro and Joseph.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who marries a woman needs to </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">examine her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>so that he will know in advance what character his children will have, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Nahshon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 6:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference from that which is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The daughter of Amminadav,” do I not know that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she is the sister of Nahshon, </span>as Nahshon was the son of Amminadav? <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “The sister of Nahshon”? From here </span>one learns <span class="gemarra-regular">that one who marries a woman needs to examine her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brothers. </span>The reason is as the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: Most sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">resemble the mother’s brothers.</span>
In connection with the Gemara’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Gemara quotes additional statements of the Sages concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought you here [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">halom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and what [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are you doing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this place, and what do you have here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?” </span>(Judges 18:3). The Sages interpret their multiple questions. <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">halom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 3:5)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you not come from Moses, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about whom it is written: “What [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is that in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your hand” </span>(Exodus 4:2)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you not come from Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with me” </span>(Deuteronomy 5:27)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall you, </span>a descendant of our teacher Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">become a priest for idol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worship?</span>
Jonathan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: This </span>is the tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> received from the house of my father’s father: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person should always hire himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> out <span class="gemarra-regular">to idol worship </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and not require </span>the help <span class="gemarra-regular">of people </span>by receiving charity, and I took this position in order to avoid having to take charity.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he, </span>Jonathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that this referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to actual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, </span>that was not the intent of the tradition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>here the term <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, </span>literally: Strange service, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., labor, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">strange, </span>i.e., unsuitable, <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>In other words, one should be willing to perform labor that is difficult and humiliating in his eyes rather than become a recipient of charity. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Kahana, </span>his student: <span class="gemarra-regular">Skin a carcass in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the market and take payment, but do not say: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am a great ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this matter is beneath </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me.</span>
The Gemara continues its discussion of that episode. Later, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">David saw that money was excessively precious to </span>Jonathan, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appointed him </span>as director <span class="gemarra-regular">of the treasuries </span>of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And Shebuel, the son of Gershom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries” </span>(I Chronicles 26:24). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And was his name </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">Shebuel; but wasn’t his name Jonathan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan says: </span>He is called Shebuel in order to allude to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he repented and <span class="gemarra-regular">returned to God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shav</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">la’el </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with all his heart.</span>
§ The mishna teaches in the list of those who inherit from and bequeath to each other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sons </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">their father. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that sons inherit the entire estate and daughters do not receive a share along with them? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “If a man dies, </span>and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>the inheritance would be passed to a daughter is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he has no son, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has a son, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son takes precedence. Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Abaye: </span>Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a son, let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son inherit </span>the father’s estate; if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter inherit </span>the father’s estate; and if <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a son and a daughter, neither this one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should inherit nor that one should inherit.</span>
Abaye asked Rav Pappa: <span class="gemarra-regular">And rather, </span>

Daf 110b

<span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">should inherit? Is that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say that the rule</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the city should inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rav Pappa said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what I </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a son and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">should not inherit all of </span>the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">should not inherit all of </span>the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they should inherit it </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: But is the verse necessary </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that when he has only one child, </span>that child <span class="gemarra-regular">should inherit all of his property? </span>If you say that the right of the son and daughter to the inheritance is equal, then the verse: “If a man dies, and has no son” (Numbers 27:8), which teaches that when there is no son his daughter inherits, is superfluous. Rav Pappa responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a daughter is also subject to </span>receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance. </span>The Gemara replies: No, the verse does not need to teach us this, since <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance” </span>(Numbers 36:8), which clearly states that a daughter is subject to receiving inheritance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a son inherits his father’s estate and precedes a daughter is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>in the passage in the Torah where the daughters of Zelophehad request their father’s inheritance in Eretz Yisrael. They said to Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Why should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of our father be done away from among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his family, because he has no son?” </span>(Numbers 27:4). Rabbi Aḥa ben Ya’akov infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>they requested the inheritance is <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>as they said: He <span class="gemarra-regular">has no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son. </span>One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has a son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son takes precedence </span>and the daughters would not have requested an inheritance.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters of Zelophehad who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this, </span>i.e., that they were entitled to an inheritance only because their father had no son. They thought that this was the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> based on the custom at that time, but after God spoke to Moses, the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> given and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was initiated </span>that a daughter’s right to inherit is equal to that of the son. The Gemara accepts this difficulty and states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clear </span>that the source for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> answered initially, </span>i.e., as Abaya derived from the verse of: “If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The source for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a son precedes a daughter is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “Who is next to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakkarov</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">elav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 27:11), teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">closer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>one is to the deceased, the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>one is in the order of inheritance, and a son of the deceased is considered to be a closer relative to the deceased than the daughter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>demonstrates the <span class="gemarra-regular">closeness</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a son more than </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter? That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a son stands in place of his father to designate</span> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to an ancestral field. </span>The Gemara rejects this: This is not a valid proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">designation </span>cannot demonstrate that a son is a closer relative; <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not subject to designation, </span>because she obviously cannot marry the Hebrew maidservant. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ancestral field as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establishes his </span>ruling that a son is a closer relative than others <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">refutation: Is there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> levirate marriage except in a case where there is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son? </span>And this applies also where there is no daughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is clear </span>that the source for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we answered initially.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say</span> instead that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a son precedes a daughter is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>in the passage in the Torah addressing the inheritance of slaves, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may make them an inheritance for your sons [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">livneikhem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you” </span>(Leviticus 25:46). One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your sons,” but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not your daughters. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then when the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That your days may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be multiplied, and the days of your sons [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beneikhem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Deuteronomy 11:21), should one infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">this too </span>means: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sons,” but not your daughters? </span>Is it not obvious that daughters are also worthy of receiving the blessing of longevity?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A blessing is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In a verse that speaks of blessings, the term <span class="it-text">beneikhem</span> should be understood in its broader sense, as “your children.” In a verse that speaks of a <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it is to be understood in the narrower sense of “your sons.”
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And paternal brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>from one another <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeath </span>to each other. <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do we </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>a verbal analogy between the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">Brothers,</span> stated with regard to inheritance, and the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">Brothers, </span>found in the verses concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob’s sons. </span>When Jacob’s sons speak to Joseph, they state: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:13), and in the passage discussing inheritance the verse states: “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the verse concerning Jacob’s sons, the word brothers is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">paternal</span> brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">and not maternal </span>brothers, as the twelve of them shared only the same father, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>where this term is used with regard to inheritance, the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">paternal </span>brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">and not maternal </span>brothers.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why do I </span>need this proof from the verse concerning Jacob’s sons? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>in the passage concerning inheritance: “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">family, and he shall inherit it” </span>(Numbers 27:11). When the term “family” is used in the Bible, one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s family is called </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family, </span>while one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s family is not called </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family, </span>so that in all matters of inheritance, it is the patrilineal relatives who are taken into account.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it is indeed so </span>that the verbal analogy is not needed to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when Rabba’s </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the matter of levirate marriage, </span>teaching that levirate marriage is performed only by a paternal brother but not by a maternal brother.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a man </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother </span>inherits from her relatives but does not bequeath to her. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where are these matters </span>derived? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught: </span>

Daf 111a

The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children of Israel” </span>(Numbers 36:8). Noting the plural in the phrase “from the tribes of the children of Israel,” the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter inherit </span>land from <span class="gemarra-regular">two tribes? Rather, this </span>is referring to a daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">from one tribe but her mother </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another tribe, and they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and she inherited </span>from both of <span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>Therefore, it can be seen in this verse that a daughter inherits from her mother.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter </span>inherits from her mother; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>inherits from his mother as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a daughter, whose power is diminished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s property </span>in that she does not inherit it when there is a son, yet her power <span class="gemarra-regular">is enhanced with regard to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property </span>in that she inherits it; with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, whose power is enhanced with regard to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s property </span>in that he is first in the order of inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that his power </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is enhanced with regard to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s property? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from the place that you came, </span>i.e., from the inference that was just stated, one can say the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to a father’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">a son precedes a daughter, so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>with regard to a mother’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son precedes a daughter. </span>This is the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Zekharya ben Hakatzav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the son and the daughter are equal with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mother’s property. What is the reason </span>for his ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source. </span>According to this principle, a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived by means of an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference cannot go beyond the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the source from which it is derived. Since the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a son inherits from his mother was derived via an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a daughter inherits from her mother, it cannot be that this inference should lead to the conclusion that a son precedes a daughter in inheriting from their mother.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And doesn’t the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>verses employing the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, </span>which limits the extent of <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, </span>so how could he disagree with it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that explains the hermeneutical principles: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference </span>work? The verse states with regard to Miriam, after she spoke ill of her brother Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord said to Moses: If her father had but spit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in her face, should she not hide in shame seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days?” </span>(Numbers 12:14). The verse is saying that if a father spits in the face of his daughter and reprimands her, she would feel shame for seven days. By <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference it is derived that Miriam, who suffered the more severe reprimand <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Divine Presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> should be ostracized for <span class="gemarra-regular">fourteen </span>days. Why then, was Miriam ostracized for only seven days?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source, </span>so her punishment cannot be for longer than the punishment of one who is reprimanded by a father. In any event, the principle the begins with: It is sufficient, can be seen in this verse, so how does the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> rule that a son precedes a daughter with regard to a mother’s property?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Generally, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">interprets</span> verses employing the principle that begins with: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient, but it is different here </span>with regard to inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: </span>“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">from the tribes </span>of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the mother </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the father. </span>Therefore, the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the father, </span>i.e., inheriting from one’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son precedes a daughter, so too, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the mother, </span>i.e., inheriting from one’s mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">a son precedes a daughter.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Nittai thought to perform an action, </span>i.e., issue a ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, </span>who taught that a son and daughter are equal with regard to inheriting from their mother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to him: In accordance with whose </span>opinion do you wish to issue this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Zekharya? Zekharya is nil [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his statement was not accepted as <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tavla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed an action, </span>i.e., issued a ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said to him: What is this? </span>Rabbi Tavla <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: As Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya says in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rav: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Go retract your </span>ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>you do <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I will take Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya out of your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I will punish you severely for ruling against the accepted <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara relates further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya thought to perform an action, </span>i.e., issue a ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben HaKatzav. Rav Naḥman said to him: What is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Shall I send </span>a messenger <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Huna to ask him if that is indeed what he said? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">was embarrassed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he was not certain that Rav Huna actually said this ruling. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Now, if Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">died, you would have been brazen </span>enough to say <span class="gemarra-regular">before me </span>that this is what he said, but since he is still alive, you cannot be so brazen.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he, </span>Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does he hold? </span>As there were various sages who ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, why did Rav Naḥman not agree? The Gemara answers: He holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav and Shmuel, who both say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yannai, </span>who had already grown old and whose eyes were dim, <span class="gemarra-regular">would walk leaning on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, his attendant, and Rabbi Yehuda Nesi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came toward them. </span>Rabbi Simlai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yannai: The <span class="gemarra-regular">person who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">coming toward us is handsome and his cloak </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">handsome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When </span>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">reached him, </span>Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">felt</span> his cloak and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Simlai: Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>cloak, <span class="gemarra-regular">its measurement </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">is like the </span>measurement of <span class="gemarra-regular">sackcloth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning it was a cloak of inferior quality, as it was thick and rough.
When Rabbi Yehuda Nesia met Rabbi Yannai he <span class="gemarra-regular">asked him: From where</span> is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a son precedes a daughter with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to the mother’s property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: As it is written: </span>“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from <span class="gemarra-regular">the tribes </span>of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mother to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the father. </span>This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father a son precedes a daughter, so too, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the mother, a son precedes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter. </span>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>so, if these two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are in fact juxtaposed, the following should also be derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s tribe a firstborn takes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a double </span>portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to inheritance from <span class="gemarra-regular">the mother’s tribe, </span>when he inherits from his mother <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn takes a double </span>portion. 

Daf 111b

<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to his attendant: Take </span>me away from here, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>man, Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not desire to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> but is instead raising difficulties that are easily resolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>he does not receive a double portion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: The verse </span>concerning the double portion received by a firstborn son <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“By giving him a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all that he has” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that he receives a double portion in all that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>has, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>in all that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>has.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bachelor who married a widow, </span>i.e., a man who marries a woman who already has children from another man, so that the firstborn son is his firstborn but not hers, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bachelor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who married a virgin, so too </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> will be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>their firstborn son <span class="gemarra-regular">will take </span>a double portion of his mother’s inheritance?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>There is a different derivation teaching that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as the same <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“For he is <span class="gemarra-regular">the first fruits of his strength [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ono</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the double portion is stated with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his strength, but not her strength,</span> thereby excluding a son who is the firstborn of his mother alone.
The Gemara challenges: But <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a child who <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>into the world <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>his mother gave birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">non-viable newborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who did not reach the full term of nine months. This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>such a firstborn son <span class="gemarra-regular">should be a firstborn with regard to inheritance, </span>even though he is not a firstborn with regard to the mitzva to redeem one’s firstborn son. How is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from the verse? The term “his strength [<span class="it-text">ono</span>]” is understood as referring to acute mourning [<span class="it-text">aninut</span>], in the following manner: A firstborn son for the purpose of inheritance of land is only <span class="gemarra-regular">one whose </span>father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heart is pained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about him </span>when he dies, i.e., a son who lives beyond birth, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding this </span>non-viable newborn <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not pained about him </span>when he dies. Therefore, the next viable son to be born after a non-viable newborn is considered the firstborn.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that the sole purpose of the term: “His strength” is to teach that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: For he is the first fruit of strength [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],</span> omitting the possessive “his,” represented by the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is derived from the more expanded term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His strength [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ono</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which indicates specifically the father’s strength? <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude two</span> conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from it, </span>both with regard to mourning and with regard to the status of the firstborn as the father’s heir specifically.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">still say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a widower who married a virgin, </span>so that he already has a firstborn from his previous marriage who is the first fruit of his strength. And the son born to him and his second wife is not the first fruit of his strength, and it is this type of firstborn who does not inherit a double portion of his mother’s estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bachelor who married a virgin, so too </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> will be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>their shared firstborn son <span class="gemarra-regular">will take </span>a double portion of his mother’s inheritance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rava said: </span>There is a different derivation teaching that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as the same <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “The right of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn is his” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17). The emphasis on “his” indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the primogeniture </span>applies specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the primogeniture does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to a woman, </span>whether the woman is the one inheriting or is the legator.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a man </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> inherits but does not bequeath. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse concerning inheritance states: “And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to <span class="gemarra-regular">his kinsman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’ero</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who is next to him of his family, and he shall inherit it” (Numbers 27:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>kinsman is <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife, </span>and the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that a husband inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the Gemara will explain later. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">she would also inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he shall inherit it,”</span> with the word “it” written in the feminine “<span class="it-text">otah</span>,” which can also be translated as: Her. This teaches that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">he who inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her, but she does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the verses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not written like this. </span>The verse states that “his kinsman” inherits from the deceased, so that if that term is referring to one’s wife, a wife should inherit from her husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Answer like this, </span>i.e., as if the verse were split into two parts. The first part is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Then you shall give his inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to he who is next to him, </span>which is a general statement with regard to the inheritance of relatives. The second is: <span class="gemarra-regular">His kinsman, and he shall inherit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>meaning that a husband inherits from his kinsman, referring to his wife.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">a sharp knife cut verses? </span>How can you split the verse, rearrange it and omit letters from its words? Abaye’s derivation rearranges the words and omits the letter <span class="it-text">lamed</span> from the term “to his kinsman [<span class="it-text">leshe’ero</span>].” <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rava said: This </span>is what the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall give the inheritance of his kinsman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ero</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to him. </span>The letters should be arranged differently, removing the letter <span class="it-text">lamed</span> from the word <span class="it-text">leshe’ero</span> and the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> from the word <span class="it-text">naḥalato</span> and combining them to form the word <span class="it-text">lo</span>, meaning: To him. Accordingly, the verse teaches that a husband inherits from his wife. The Gemara explains that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">subtract and add</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and interpret homiletically</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that letters can be removed from words and appended to each other, and a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived from the new word formed by the combination of letters.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cites </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a husband inherits from his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherit it,” </span>with the word “it” written in the feminine “<span class="it-text">otah</span>,” which can also be translated as: Her. This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that a husband inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva, </span>similar to the derivation cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> quotes another <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This derivation <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the children of Israel </span>shall be wife <span class="gemarra-regular">to one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the family </span>of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8). The purpose of this mitzva was so that the land she inherited from her father’s tribe will not be transferred to another tribe upon her death. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> speaks of a transfer </span>of inheritance from one tribe to another <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the husband, </span>i.e., she must not marry a man from another tribe so that the land will not be transferred to that tribe when her husband inherits from her upon her death. This indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>another verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from tribe to tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:9), also indicating that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse in the Prophets <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And Elazar, the son of Aaron, died; and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> buried him in the Hill of Pinehas his son, </span>which was given him in Mount Ephraim” (Joshua 24:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">And from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas hav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> land <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, did not have? Rather, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Pinehas married a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woman </span>who inherited her father’s land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">died and he inherited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>so that he had his own land. This also indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse in the Writings <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And Seguv begot Yair, who had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead” </span>(I Chronicles 2:22). 

Daf 112a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from where </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair hav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> land <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Seguv, did not have? </span>Rather, this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Yair </span><span class="gemarra-regular">married a woman </span>who inherited her father’s land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she died and he inherited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>so that he had his own land. This also indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
The Gemara proceeds to explain this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it states? </span>Why is it necessary to provide additional proofs beyond the first verse? The Gemara explains: The first verse seems to prove the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a husband inherits from his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>that rules that a woman who inherited land from her father cannot marry a man from another tribe is not concerned that he will inherit from her, but rather the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerned about a transfer </span>of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the son </span>who will inherit from his mother, as he belongs to his father’s tribe, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a husband does not inherit </span>from his wife; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another verse that is seemingly superfluous: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribe to tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:7). This teaches that a transfer of land could occur by means of the husband inheriting from her.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you would say </span>that this verse is also concerned with the transfer of the inheritance by means of the son, and that the seemingly superfluous verse is stated for another purpose, i.e., in order to establish that a woman who inherited land from her father and marries a man from another tribe <span class="gemarra-regular">will violate for that </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition,</span> namely: “So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and a positive mitzva, </span>namely: “Shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father”; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another verse that is seemingly superfluous: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:9), which teaches that a transfer can occur by means of the husband inheriting from his wife.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that this verse is also concerned with the transfer of the inheritance by means of the son, and that the seemingly superfluous verse is stated for another purpose, i.e., in order to establish that a woman who inherited land from her father and marries a man from another tribe <span class="gemarra-regular">violates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">two prohibitions and a positive mitzva; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another proof that a husband inherits from his wife, from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Elazar, the son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron, died” </span>(Joshua 24:33).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you would say </span>that Pinehas did not inherit this land from his wife, but from his mother, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar, </span>his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">who married a woman </span>who inherited land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and </span>her son <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas inherited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>so that this verse proves the inheritance of a son and not that of a husband; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Seguv begot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yair” </span>(I Chronicles 2:22).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would say: That is </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">there as well,</span> that it was Yair who inherited it from his deceased mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two verses </span>to teach the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Abaye: From where </span>do you know that this is how the verse should be understood? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">actually say to you: A husband does not inherit </span>from his wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the verses are </span>concerned <span class="gemarra-regular">about a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the son, as we explained, </span>teaching that one who does so violates two prohibitions and a positive mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair, </span>one could say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he purchased </span>it from a third party and did not inherit it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas as well, </span>one could say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he purchased </span>it from a third party.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You cannot say that Pinehas purchased </span>the land where he buried his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if so, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">field would return</span> to its original owner <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Jubilee </span>Year (see Leviticus, chapter 25), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it would be found </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">righteous man, </span>i.e., Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">is burie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a grave</span> in land <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not his.</span>
Rav Pappa asked further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say that </span>in his capacity as a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">he came into </span>possession of this land <span class="gemarra-regular">as a dedicated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Pinehas, as a priest, may have owned the land by that means. Therefore, one can still say that a husband does not inherit from his wife, and the verses are concerned about a transfer of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of the son.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Even if you say that her son and not her husband inherits from her, <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is uproote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the tribe of the mother and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is moved to the tribe of the father, </span>and the prohibition against her marrying a man from another tribe is not effective in achieving its goal. The verse speaks of a woman who inherited the land from her mother who is of a different tribe from her father (see 111a). Even if she marries a man from her own tribe, the inheritance will be transferred from her mother’s tribe to that of her, the woman’s, husband, as even if the woman’s son inherits, he is of his father’s tribe.
Rav Pappa rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>do you raise your challenge? <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, as </span>the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">had already been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> transferred </span>by the mother of the woman when she married the father, so that the Torah is no longer concerned with the continued transfer. When the parents of this now-deceased woman married, the land that her mother would eventually inherit was already thought of as being transferred away from the ownership of her mother’s tribe. Therefore, the fact that even if this woman’s son inherits from her, the fact that the land will permanently belong to a member of her husband’s tribe is of no concern. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We do not say, </span>i.e., employ, the logic of: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it had already been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> transferred, </span>since as long as this woman owned it, it still belonged to a person of the first tribe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Even according to Abaye, who holds the verses teach that the husband inherits, there is still a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>the logic of: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it has already been transferred, this is </span>how it can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse is established </span>as referring to both scenarios: The verse can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">either with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a transfer </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the son </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a transfer </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband. </span>In both of these scenarios, the daughter’s marriage to a man from her father’s tribe is effective in ensuring that land she will inherit will not leave the tribe, because if she inherited it from her father it remains within the same tribe, and if she inherited it from her mother it had already been transferred when her mother married her father.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>the logic of: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has already been transferred, </span>then even <span class="gemarra-regular">when she gets married</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to one of the family of the tribe of her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father, what of it? But an inheritance is uprooted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the tribe of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>who had inherited land from her, the mother’s, father, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the tribe of</span> her <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>as her husband is from her father’s tribe.
Rav Ashi said to him: There is a way that the transfer to another tribe can be avoided: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where we marry her to a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose father </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">from her father’s tribe and his mother is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from her mother’s tribe, </span>the transfer is avoided as the land retains the exact status as it had when it was in the woman’s possession. 

Daf 112b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if a daughter who inherits land from both of her parents must marry a man whose father is from her father’s tribe and whose mother is from her mother’s tribe, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse: “Shall be a wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said: Shall be a wife <span class="gemarra-regular">to one of the family of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tribe of her father and her mother. </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">were written like this, I would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the opposite </span>is permitted, that she may marry a man whose mother is from her father’s tribe and whose father is from her mother’s tribe. As long as she marries someone who is connected to both tribes, it is permitted. The verse therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the opposite is not permitted.
The Gemara comments: Concerning the marriage of a woman who inherited land, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the son, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the husband. </span>The Gemara presents the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the son, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transfer from tribe to tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:7); that <span class="gemarra-regular">verse speaks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son. </span>The Torah prohibits the woman from marrying a man from a different tribe since her son will inherit from her and thereby the inheritance will transfer away from its original tribe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Do you say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the son, or is it only with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the husband? When it says: “So shall no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:9), the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the husband. How do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I realize </span>the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:7)? That <span class="gemarra-regular">verse speaks of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the son.</span>

Daf 113a

It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall no inheritance transfer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one tribe to another tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:9); <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse speaks of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the husband. </span>The Torah prohibits the woman from marrying a man from a different tribe since her husband will inherit from her, thereby transferring her inheritance away from its original tribe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Do you say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means of the husband, or is it only with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the son? When it says: “So shall no inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 36:7), the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the son.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How do I realize </span>the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tribe” </span>(Numbers 36:9)? That <span class="gemarra-regular">verse speaks of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the husband.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., according to both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, the phrase in <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “from one tribe to another tribe” speaks of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the husband. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred? </span>The Gemara supplies <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Rav Sheila said </span>that the latter part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave <span class="gemarra-regular">each one [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to its own inheritance,” alluding to the transfer by means of the husband, as the word “<span class="it-text">ish</span>” means husband, in the context of: “Elimelech the husband [<span class="it-text">ish</span>] of Naomi” (Ruth 1:3). The Gemara asks: But the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written in bot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>a different explanation. The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “Shall cleave,” </span>and this term alludes to marriage, as in the context of: “And he shall cleave to his wife” (Genesis 2:24). The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“shall cleave” is written in both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different explanation: The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">The tribes </span>of the children of Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">shall cleave,” </span>and tribes cleave to one another through marriage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said</span> another explanation: The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “From one tribe to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribe,” and a son is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">“another,” </span>as he is an extension of his mother.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says, and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">determined it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Korḥa: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a husband </span>who inherits from his wife does not <span class="gemarra-regular">take in </span>inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">du</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property she <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Instead of the husband inheriting the property that was due to her, that property is inherited by her other relatives, such as her son, or other relatives of her father. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Seguv begot Yair, who had twenty three cities in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">land of Gilead” </span>(I Chronicles 2:22). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair have </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Seguv, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not have? Rather, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Seguv married a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman and she died in the lifetime of her </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">legators, and her legators </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and Yair, </span>her son, not Seguv, her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">inherited </span>these inheritances from <span class="gemarra-regular">her.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And Elazar, the son of Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, died; and they buried </span>him in the Hill of Pinehas his son” (Joshua 24:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Pinehas have </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar, did not have? </span>Rather, this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Elazar married a woman and she died in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lifetime of her </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">legators, and her legators </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and Pinehas </span>her son, not Elazar her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">inherited </span>the property from <span class="gemarra-regular">her.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is stated? </span>Why is it necessary to provide an additional proof beyond the first verse? The Gemara explains. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say:</span> In the verse concerning Seguv and Yair, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>not Seguv, <span class="gemarra-regular">who married a woman and she died and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he inherited </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her, </span>and he did not inherit from his mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And Elazar, the son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Aaron, died; </span>and they buried him in the Hill of Pinehas his son” (Joshua 24:33), teaching that Pinehas inherited the land of those from whom his mother inherited, and Elazar did not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that </span>this land <span class="gemarra-regular">came into </span>the possession of Pinehas <span class="gemarra-regular">as a dedicated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field, </span>as he was a priest, and he did not inherit it from his mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “His </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> indicating that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fitting for him, </span>i.e., Elazar, had his wife not predeceased her legators, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his son inherited it.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And sons of sisters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., nephews born to the sisters of the deceased, inherit from their maternal uncles but do not bequeath to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">sons of sisters but not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of sisters. </span>

Daf 113b

<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> was this said? It is obvious that in principle daughters have the right to inherit from their maternal uncle, as the mother inherits from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that where there are sons as well, they <span class="gemarra-regular">preced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the daughters in inheriting from their maternal uncle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Yitzḥak taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Huna: </span>At the end of the passage discussing inheritance of land, the verse states: “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall inheri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> it” (Numbers 27:11). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes a secondary inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that of one inheriting from other relatives, <span class="gemarra-regular">to a primary inheritance, </span>that of a child inheriting from a parent. This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary inheritance a son precedes a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a secondary inheritance a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son precedes a daughter.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ḥanina taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman: </span>A verse in the passage concerning the double portion inherited by a firstborn states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then it shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be on the day that he causes his sons to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>that which he has” (Deuteronomy 21:16). The addition of the phrase “on the day” teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you may distribute inheritances, but you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not distribute inheritances at night. Abaye said to him: </span>That cannot be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as, <span class="gemarra-regular">if that is so,</span> it ought to be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one who dies during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day is </span>the one from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom his children inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who dies at night, his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children do not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>and this is not the case.
Abaye suggests a different interpretation of Rabba bar Ḥanina’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps you said</span> a distinction between day and night with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">adjudication of inheritances, </span>as judges are permitted to sit only during the day. A proof for this distinction is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A verse in the passage concerning inheritance states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it shall be for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the children of Israel a statute of judgment” </span>(Numbers 27:11), teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire portion was placed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ure’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">to be </span>considered a matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> subject to the procedural rules of a court matter.
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says: </span>In a case where there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">who entere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> a room <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> visit a sick person </span>and the sick person desired to write a will in order to distribute his property following his death, if the visitors <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may write </span>his will and sign it as witnesses. And if <span class="gemarra-regular">they wish, they may act </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment, </span>i.e., they may act as a court in the matter, since there are three of them. Therefore, they can determine that the will has the validity of an act of court and transfer the property to the heirs in their capacity as a court. But if only <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>came to visit the sick person, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may write </span>the will and sign it as witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they may not act </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment, </span>since three are required to form a court. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda says: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught only </span>in a case where the three came to visit him <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day, </span>

Daf 114a

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if they came <span class="gemarra-regular">at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>men came to visit the sick person, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may write </span>the will and sign it as witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">but they may not act </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that they may not act in judgment the next day? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>to the will of the deceased, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a witness cannot become a judge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one who acts as a witness in a particular matter cannot become a judge with regard to that same matter? Rabba bar Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is indeed so; </span>this is what <span class="gemarra-regular">I was saying.</span>
§ After mentioning Rav Yehuda’s ruling the Gemara cites a related dispute. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction, until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when </span>may one of the parties <span class="gemarra-regular">reneg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> on the transaction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: As long as they are seated </span>in the same location they may renege on the transaction. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef says: As long as they are dealing with that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>i.e., they are still discussing that transaction, they may renege on it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: It stands to reason in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with my opinion, as Rav Yehuda says: </span>In a case where there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">who entered </span>a room <span class="gemarra-regular">to visit a sick person </span>and the sick person desires to write a will in order to distribute his property following his death, if the visitors <span class="gemarra-regular">wish </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">they may write </span>his will and sign it as witnesses. And if <span class="gemarra-regular">they wish, they may act </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it enters your mind </span>that one may renege on a deal <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as they are seated </span>in the same location, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let us be concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will renege on </span>his decision. How can the visitors act in judgment in a case where the matter has not been resolved, as the sick person may still change his mind?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: I stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Kahana </span>and I asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, does it work out well? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even according to his opinion there <span class="gemarra-regular">should be a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will renege on </span>his decision, as Rav Yosef holds that one may renege on a transaction as long as the two parties are still dealing with that matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say? </span>That according to Rav Yosef, Rav Yehuda’s ruling applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">withdrew</span>

Daf 114b

<span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>discussing that <span class="gemarra-regular">matter to </span>discuss a different <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>so he can no longer renege on his decision. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>according to Rabba, one can explain that Rav Yehuda was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arose and then sat </span>down again. Although no support for Rav Yosef’s opinion was adduced from Rav Yehuda’s ruling, the Gemara nevertheless states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the disputes concerning the division of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, </span>discussed above (12b), reneging while they are discussing the same <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>discussed here, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span> of one’s property, discussed below (143a).
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>bequeaths to <span class="gemarra-regular">her son, </span>her husband, and her maternal uncles, but she does not inherit from them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well? But it is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the former</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause: A man </span>inherits from <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother and a man</span> inherits from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in this clause seems to be the same as that of the other clause.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>who bequeaths to <span class="gemarra-regular">her son </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to that </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>who bequeaths to <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>who bequeaths to <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband, the husband </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not inherit </span>property through <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>while he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if a husband predeceases his wife, then his relatives, such as children from another marriage, do not inherit the wife’s property through him but rather the wife’s own relatives inherit her property, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>who bequeaths to <span class="gemarra-regular">her son, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the son does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not inherit </span>property through <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother </span>while he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the grav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to bequeath to his paternal brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In both cases, the woman’s own relatives inherit her property.
§ With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a mother inherits from her son, the Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon: By Torah law a father inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a woman inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> if the father is no longer alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated</span> with regard to a woman receiving inheritance: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes </span>of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). Since the plural term “tribes” includes both her father’s tribe and her mother’s tribe, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of the mother to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tribe of the father, </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s tribe a father inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his son, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the mother’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribe, a woman inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her son </span>if the father is deceased. 

Daf 115a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon </span>from the mishna, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A woman </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">her son, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband, and maternal uncles </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath </span>to their respective relatives <span class="gemarra-regular">but do not inherit </span>from them. The mishna states explicitly that a mother does not inherit her son’s property. Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna, I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not know who taught it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I am not aware of any <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who concurs with its ruling and it is not the accepted <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>written in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, who, </span>as noted on page 111a, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that sons precede daughters with regard to the inheritance of their mother from the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“tribes.” </span>Since Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon’s ruling is based on a derivation from the word “tribes,” it stands to reason that Rabbi Zekharya disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon, and the ruling of the mishna is in accordance with Rabbi Zekharya’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna cannot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be interpreted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben HaKatzav, as it teaches: And the sons of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sister </span>inherit but do not bequeath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> that the mishna is referring only to <span class="gemarra-regular">sons of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> siste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters of a sister, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say: With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is there a distinction between the sons and daughters of a sister? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>The distinction is meant <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that where there are sons as well, they <span class="gemarra-regular">precede </span>the daughters in inheriting from their maternal uncle.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>written in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben HaKatzav, doesn’t he say: Both the son and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter are equal with regard to the mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>as they inherit equally? The mishna stands in contraposition to Rabbi Zekharya’s ruling, and therefore it cannot be written in accordance with his opinion.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>look at it, is inconsistent: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he interprets </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“tribes,” </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman also should inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as noted above (114b). And <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not interpret </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“tribes,” </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">from where is it </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son precedes a daughter with regard to</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the mother? </span>Both <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are derived from the same source, so how can the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> accept one and reject the other?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">inter-prets </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“tribes,” but it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different here, </span>with regard to a woman inheriting from her son, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “And every daughter </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">possesses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">oreshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] an inheritanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from the tribes” (Numbers 36:8), which teaches that a daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">oreshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>from two tribes, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> she <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bequeath </span>to two tribes. She bequeaths only to her father’s tribe.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <span class="gemarra-regular">order </span>of precedence with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritances is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man dies, and has no son, then you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” </span>(Numbers 27:8). This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son precedes a daughter. </span>Additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> descendants of a son precede a daughter. A daughter precedes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the brothers </span>of the deceased. Additionally, the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> daughter precede the brothers </span>of the deceased. <span class="gemarra-regular">Brothers </span>of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the uncles </span>of the deceased. Additionally, the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of the brothers precede the uncles.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precedes </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede </span>the other as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a father </span>who inherits <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of his descendants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The verse states: “If a man dies, and has no <span class="gemarra-regular">son, </span>then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>precedes others with regard to the inheritance of the deceased; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son of a son, or a daughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a son, or a son of a daughter of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>also precedes the deceased’s other relatives? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“If a man dies, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ein</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> son.” The word <span class="it-text">ein</span> is written <span class="it-text">aleph</span>, <span class="it-text">yod</span>, <span class="it-text">nun</span>.

Daf 115b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., how is the investigation performed when he has no offspring at all? The Gemara answers: The family lineage that determines the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance is successively</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up to Reuben, </span>son of Jacob, i.e., the heirs are determined by investigating the family genealogy, and that investigation can extend all the way to Reuben, son of our forefather Jacob. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Until Jacob </span>himself, rather than until Reuben, since if none of Reuven’s descendants survive, one would have to examine Jacob’s descendants. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in reply: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is learned </span>as a tradition <span class="gemarra-regular">that a tribe will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be eliminate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> entirely, and some descendants will always remain.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter </span>of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>the estate of her father along <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the deceased, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a prince of the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">should not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> listen to him, as this is nothing other than an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> act of the Sadducees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and runs counter to the ruling of the mishna that the descendants of a son inherit before a daughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in <span class="it-text">Megillat</span> <span class="it-text">Ta’anit</span>, which describes various minor holidays on which it is forbidden to fast or eulogize: <span class="gemarra-regular">On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the twenty-fourth of Tevet, we returned to our law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was reestablished in accordance with the opinion of the Sages after having been dictated by the Sadducees. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Sadducees would say: A daughter should inherit</span> the estate of her father along <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daughter of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the son </span>of the deceased.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan ben Zakka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> joined them </span>to discuss their ruling, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Imbeciles, from where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">And there was no person that answered him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything, except for one old </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who was chattering at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him and saying </span>that it is an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a daughter of </span>the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who comes </span>to claim her inheritance from her grandfather <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">virtue of his son, inherits </span>her grandfather’s property, so too, with regard to the deceased’s own <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who comes </span>to inherit <span class="gemarra-regular">by virtue of </span>the deceased, <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that she should inherit his property?
Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <span class="gemarra-regular">recited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this verse about him: “These are the sons of Seir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Zibeon and Anah” </span>(Genesis 36:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Anah” </span>(Genesis 36:24). The first verse portrays Zibeon and Anah as brothers, while the second states that they are father and son. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Zibeon engaged in sexual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intercours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his mother and begot Anah, </span>so that he was both Anah’s father and his brother. From the fact that the first verse equates Zibeon and Anah by referring to both of them as Seir’s sons despite Anah being a grandson of Seir, it is clear that grandchildren are equal to children, contrary to the Sadducees’ assertion.
The Gemara interrupts the recounting of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and questions Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps there were two </span>people named <span class="gemarra-regular">Anah, </span>so that one Anah was Zibeon’s son, and the other his brother? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: I will state a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">King Shapu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not state. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span>this King Shapur? This cannot be a reference to Shapur, king of Persia; rather, it must be a moniker for someone else. He is <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>whose legal rulings were accepted by the public like the edicts of a king by his subjects. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some state </span>a different version, that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will state a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">King Shapur did not state. And who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this King Shapur? He is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba. The verse </span>goes on to <span class="gemarra-regular">state: “This is Anah” </span>(Genesis 36:24), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">Anah </span>mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">initially, </span>earlier in the verse. Accordingly, there was only one Anah, who was both Zibeon’s brother and Zibeon’s son.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: The Sadducee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <span class="gemarra-regular">My teacher, you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dismiss me with thi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> retort? I agree that the son of a son precedes a daughter, as the verse you quoted suggests; I am asserting that a daughter inherits together with the daughter of a son, and the verse you quoted has no bearing on that claim. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Imbecile, </span>

Daf 116a

<span class="gemarra-regular">but will our perfect Torah not be </span>as worthy <span class="gemarra-regular">as your frivolous speech, </span>as your inference is fallacious: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter of </span>the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that her right </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is enhanced </span>in that she inherits from her paternal grandfather together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of her father. Would you <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the same applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, whose right </span>to inherit <span class="gemarra-regular">is diminished </span>in that she does not inherit from her father together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers? </span>The Sadducee’s <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is thereby disproved. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since the Sadducees had no counterargument, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were victorious over them, and they established that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>the twenty-fourth of Tevet, as a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">festival </span>to celebrate the establishment of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with the opinion of the Sages.
Having discussed the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a son’s daughter’s right to inheritance, the Gemara cites a verse that relates to the matter. After the incident known as: The concubine in Gibeah, the men of the tribe of Benjamin numbered only six hundred, and each of these men had inherited large plots of land from their deceased relatives. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they said: They that are escaped must be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blotted out from Israel” </span>(Judges 21:17).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak of the house of Rabbi Ami says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the elders of that generation <span class="gemarra-regular">stipulated with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the tribe of Benjamin that a daughter of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a son shall not inherit with the brothers </span>of her father. Since the daughter of a son who inherits her grandfather’s property may later bequeath it to her husband, who may be from another tribe, the elders instituted this temporary ordinance in order to ensure that other tribes would not inherit large quantities of land belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, lest the tribe of Benjamin be left with little land of its own.
§ The Gemara presents a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Yoḥai: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who does not leave </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, the Holy One, Blessed be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He, is filled with wrath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">evra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] toward him, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written here: </span>“If a man die, and he has no son, <span class="gemarra-regular">then you shall pass his inheritance [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veha’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avartem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there: “That day is a day of wrath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">evra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Zephaniah 1:15). The words “<span class="it-text">veha’avartem</span>” and “<span class="it-text">evra</span>” share common root letters, whereby Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai interprets that God’s wrath may be the result of the inheritance passing to a daughter rather than a son.
The Gemara presents a related statement. Concerning the verse: “God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah; <span class="gemarra-regular">those that have no exchange, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fear not God” </span>(Psalms 55:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Levi </span>each interpret the verse in a different manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">One says </span>that this is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not leave </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to inherit from him, as he does not leave anyone to serve in exchange, i.e., as a replacement, for him; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that this is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not leave </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a studen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to serve in exchange for him.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">It may be concluded </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a student, for Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>whose ten sons died in his lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to those he would console: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the bone of my tenth son,</span> to encourage them not to succumb to their sorrow. Since Rabbi Yoḥanan knew that he would not leave any sons to inherit his property, it is reasonable to assume that he interpreted the verse as meaning that God is full of wrath toward one who does not leave behind a student. The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">it may be concluded that</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan who says </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a student</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a student, </span>it follows that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</span> the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a son.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this cannot be, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would not go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a house of mourning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tamya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to console the bereaved so as not to interrupt his studies, <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the house of one who died without any sons, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but <span class="gemarra-regular">weep sore for him that goes away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Jeremiah 22:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">departs </span>from this world <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>leaving behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a male child. </span>From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would console specifically one who died without leaving a son, it is apparent that he does not hold that God is full of wrath toward such an individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua ben Levi is </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a student.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yehoshua ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levi is </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a student, </span>it follows that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>it is referring to one who does not leave behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a son.</span>
The Gemara asks: This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>from one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind a son, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>as he would say: This is the bone of my tenth son. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>statement, with regard to the bone of his son, <span class="gemarra-regular">is his</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement, with regard to the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his teacher’s.</span>
§ The Gemara continues with three homiletic interpretations by Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama, and provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> to facilitate the memorization of these expositions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hadad, poverty, and sage.</span>
The Gemara presents the first homiletic interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama interpreted </span>a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that Joab the captain of the host was dead” </span>(I Kings 11:21)? <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>reason is it that <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the case of King <span class="gemarra-regular">David, sleeping was stated with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his </span>demise, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joab, death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was stated with regard to his </span>demise? He answers: Concerning King <span class="gemarra-regular">David, who left a son </span>behind, <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated with regard to his </span>demise, as it was not a complete death, while concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">Joab, who did not leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a son </span>behind, <span class="gemarra-regular">death was stated with regard to his</span> demise, as he left no son to succeed him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joab did not leave a son </span>behind; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written: “Of the sons of Joab: Obadiah, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Jehiel” </span>(Ezra 8:9)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>concerning King <span class="gemarra-regular">David, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left a son as </span>great as <span class="gemarra-regular">himself, sleeping was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to his </span>demise, but concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">Joab, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not leave a son as </span>great as <span class="gemarra-regular">himself, death </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to his </span>demise.
The Gemara presents the second homiletic interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama interpreted </span>a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">poverty in a person’s household is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more difficul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than fifty plagues</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you my friends; for the hand of God has touched </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me” </span>(Job 19:21), <span class="gemarra-regular">and his friends were saying to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Take heed, regard not iniquity; for this have you chosen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rather than poverty” </span>(Job 36:21). Job, who suffered many plagues, was told by his friends that his suffering was preferable to poverty.
The Gemara presents the third homiletic interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pineḥas bar Ḥama interpreted </span>a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically: Anyone who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has a sick person in his home should go to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sage, and </span>the sage will <span class="gemarra-regular">ask </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy on </span>the sick person’s behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a wise man will pacify it” </span>(Proverbs 16:14).
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the principle: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who precedes </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede </span>the other as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a father precedes all of his descendants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to the claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a father of the </span>deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father and</span> the claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">the brother of the </span>deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, such as </span>the claims of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham and Ishmael to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property of Esau</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who was Abraham’s grandson and Ishmael’s nephew, <span class="gemarra-regular">which of them precedes </span>the other and inherits the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A father precedes all of his descendants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>therefore, Abraham would inherit, as Ishmael was his descendant. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama </span>have a dilemma; was he not aware of the statement of the mishna? 

Daf 116b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to his keen </span>mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">analyze </span>the mishna carefully.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>With regard to the claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a father of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father and </span>the claim of the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">brother, such as </span>the claims of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham and Jacob </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the property of Esau, </span>who was Abraham’s grandson and Jacob’s brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">which of them precedes </span>the other and inherits the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A father precede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> descendants, </span>therefore, Abraham would inherit, as Jacob was his descendant. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama </span>have a dilemma; presumably, he was aware of the statement of the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rami bar Ḥama understood that the mishna teaches that a father <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own </span>immediate <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants, but not the descendants of his son.</span>
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable </span>to understand the mishna in that manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it teaches: This is the principle: Anyone who precedes </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede </span>the other as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if Isaac were </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaac </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">precede </span>Abraham and inherit Esau’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, also, when Isaac is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">precede </span>Abraham, because of the principle that the descendants of one who precedes another with regard to inheritance also precede the other. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>this clause of the mishna that the brother of the deceased precedes the grandfather.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Zelophehad’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">took three portions </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance</span> of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">Their father’s portion </span>that he received <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was among those who left Egypt; and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion </span>that he received <span class="gemarra-regular">with his brothers in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Hepher, </span>their father; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional portion that he received from Hepher <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes two portions </span>of inheritance from his father. 

Daf 117a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: In the mishna that teaches that Zelophehad and Hepher were entitled to portions in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided among those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who left Egypt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that presents three opinions as to how Eretz Yisrael was divided. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya says: Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among those who left Egypt, as it is stated: “According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the names of the tribes of their fathers they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall inherit” </span>(Numbers 26:55), which teaches that the Jewish people would inherit Eretz Yisrael according to the names of their fathers, i.e., those who left Egypt. Rabbi Yoshiya continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But how do I realize </span>the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Unto these the land shall be divided for an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inheritance” </span>(Numbers 26:53), which indicates that the land was to be divided among those recently counted in the wilderness, i.e., those who would enter Eretz Yisrael? He answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Unto these” </span>teaches that the land will be divided among those who are <span class="gemarra-regular">like these </span>people who were counted, in that they were adults above the age of twenty, <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude the children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who were not entitled to a portion in Eretz Yisrael, as they were not of age at the time of the Exodus.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> presents a second opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided among those who entered Eretz</span> Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Unto these the land shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be divided for an inheritance” </span>(Numbers 26:53). <span class="gemarra-regular">But how </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“According to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherit” </span>(Numbers 26:55)? This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">this inheritance is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different from all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritances in the world, for </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritances in the world, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">living inherit </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">dead, but here, the dead inherit </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">living</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, the portions of land received by those who entered Eretz Yisrael were transferred to their fathers who left Egypt, and then inherited by the current generation, as the Gemara will now explain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will tell you a parable. To what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this matter comparable? To two brothers </span>who were <span class="gemarra-regular">priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">who were in one town. One </span>brother <span class="gemarra-regular">has one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son, and one </span>brother <span class="gemarra-regular">has two sons, and </span>the sons all <span class="gemarra-regular">went to the threshing floor </span>to collect <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">who has one son, takes one portion </span>of the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from his child, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">who has two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons, takes two portions </span>from his sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the brothers then <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>with the three portions <span class="gemarra-regular">to their father, and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">redivide </span>the portions among themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">equally, </span>so that each brother receives one and one-half portions. When the brothers give their shares to their children, the son of the first brother will receive all that his father had received, while the sons of the other brother will divide what their father had received.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> presents a third opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar says: </span>

Daf 117b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided to these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to those</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so as to uphold these two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verses. How so? </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left Egypt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he takes his portion </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who left Egypt. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entered Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes his portion </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who entered Eretz </span>Yisrael. If one was <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he was among those who left Egypt and also entered Eretz Yisrael himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his portion from here and there, </span>as he is entitled to two portions.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: With regard to the twelve <span class="gemarra-regular">spies </span>sent to survey Eretz Yisrael prior to the Jewish people’s entry into the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua and Caleb</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took </span>all of the spies’ <span class="gemarra-regular">portions </span>of the land. Additionally, the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters and the assembly of Korah did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have a portion of Eretz </span>Yisrael. Nevertheless, their <span class="gemarra-regular">sons took </span>portions of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the merit of their paternal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grandfathers and in the merit of their maternal grandfathers </span>if they were among those who left Egypt. This concludes the Gemara’s citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“According to the names of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribes of their fathers </span>they shall inherit” (Numbers 26:55), <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written with regard to those who left Egypt; perhaps </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in reference <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the progenitors of the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes, </span>and teaches that the land should be divided among the twelve tribes? The Gemara answers: The inference is from a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“And I will bring you in to the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will give it to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a heritage: I am the Lord” </span>(Exodus 6:8). This verse states that Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">is an inheritance for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from your forefathers, and </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">was told to those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who left Egypt, </span>indicating that those who left Egypt inherit the land.
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the following series of questions posed by Rav Pappa to Abaye relating to the division of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the more; Zelophehad; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph; contested; Manasseh; will count.</span>
The Gemara presents the first question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided among those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left Egypt, this is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “To the more you shall give the more inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 26:54). The verse may be understood as teaching the novelty that even though the number of Jewish people entering Eretz Yisrael differed from the number who left Egypt, the land is nevertheless divided according to the numbers at the time of the Exodus, not according to the count at the time they received the land. 

Daf 118a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who entered Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>does the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">To the more you shall give the more inheritance” </span>teach? It is obvious that larger families will receive more land due to their greater numbers. The Gemara concludes: This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to one who holds that opinion.
The Gemara presents the second question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who left Egypt, this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters of Zelophehad cried out </span>in protest of the fact that they would be denied their father’s portion, to which he was entitled as one who left Egypt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who entered Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did they cry out </span>in protest; after all, Zelophehad <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">to take </span>his portion, so his daughters should have no claim to the land?
Abaye answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>according to this opinion, the protest of Zelophehad’s daughters was in reference <span class="gemarra-regular">to the returning </span>of the portions from the generation that entered Eretz Yisrael to the generation that left Egypt, as described in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>accordingly, Zelophehad’s daughters demanded <span class="gemarra-regular">to take </span>their portion <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of </span>their grandfather <span class="gemarra-regular">Hepher, </span>who received land posthumously through his children, their uncles.
The Gemara presents Rav Pappa’s third question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who left Egypt, this is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of Joseph cried out </span>in protest of the fact that they would receive an inadequate portion of land due to the fact that they had proliferated greatly in the wilderness. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And the children of Joseph </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>to Joshua, saying: Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, because the Lord has blessed me thus” (Joshua 17:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says</span> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who entered Eretz</span> Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">they were crying out? They</span> were <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>their own portion of land and should have had no cause for complaint.
The Gemara answers: They protested <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as they had many </span>children who were not entitled to a portion of the land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from </span>the fact that the Bible records the complaints of only the daughters of Zelophehad and the descendants of Joseph that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was not one </span>other individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not tak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a portion of land; <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not take </span>a portion of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should have cried out </span>in protest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: The verse wrote </span>about one <span class="gemarra-regular">who cried out and </span>his protest <span class="gemarra-regular">was effective, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse did not write </span>about one <span class="gemarra-regular">who cried out and </span>his protest <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effective, </span>that is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>there is the counterexample of <span class="gemarra-regular">the descendants of Joseph, who cried out and </span>their protest <span class="gemarra-regular">was not effective</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the verse wrote </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara rejects Abaye’s inference: Generally, the verse would not record an instance where one cried out if his protest was not effective, and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the verse includes the protest of Joseph’s descendants in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>a measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">good advice: That a person should be wary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the evil eye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And this is what Joshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to them, as it is written: “And Joshua said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unto them: If you be a great people, go up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the forest, </span>and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim” (Joshua 17:15). Joshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Go and conceal yourselves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the forests so that the evil eye will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have dominion over you. </span>

Daf 118b

Joseph’s descendants <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We are of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the descendants of Joseph, </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">whom the evil eye had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 49:22), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Abbahu states </span>a homiletic interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> read </span>it as <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rather </span>read it as <span class="gemarra-italic">olei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>above the eye, i.e., he transcended the influence of the evil eye. Joseph’s descendants were saying that they also do not need to be wary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥanina, said </span>that a proof for the notion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants, is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; <span class="gemarra-regular">and let them grow into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">multitude [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veyidgu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the midst of the earth” </span>(Genesis 48:16). <span class="it-text">Veyidgu</span> is related etymologically to the word for fish [<span class="it-text">dag</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fish in the sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, water covers them and the </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">eye has no dominion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over them, so too, the seed of Joseph, the </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">eye has no dominion over them.</span>
§ The Gemara analyzes the next section of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: With regard to the twelve <span class="gemarra-regular">spie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> sent to survey Eretz Yisrael prior to the Jewish people’s entry into the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua and Caleb took</span> all of the spies’ <span class="gemarra-regular">portions </span>of the land. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where is this matter </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “But Joshua, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, lived of those men </span>that went to spy out the land” (Numbers 14:38). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“lived” </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">literally </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they lived, but </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">another verse</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And there was not left a man of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, save Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Nun” </span>(Numbers 26:65), so why would the Torah state it twice? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>does the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“lived” </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> Joshua and Caleb <span class="gemarra-regular">lived in </span>the other spies’ <span class="gemarra-regular">portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the land.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> assembly of Korah did not possess a portion of Eretz</span> Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>otherwise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">spies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the assembly of Korah, Joshua and Caleb took their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portions </span>of the land? Apparently, the protesters and the assembly of Korah were assigned portions in Eretz Yisrael, which were then given to Joshua and Caleb. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> quoted earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters to the spies, </span>teaching that just as the spies were assigned a portion of Eretz Yisrael, so were the protesters. And one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> quoted here, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not juxtapose </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the spies. </span>Although the spies were assigned a portion, the protesters were not.
The Gemara quotes a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse quotes the daughters of Zelophehad: “Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the assembly of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the assembly of Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons” (Numbers 27:3), and the daughters of Zelophehad therefore claim they are entitled to his portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Our father died</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the wilderness,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Zelophehad. “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was not among the assembly,” this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">assembly of spies. “That gathered themselves together against the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” these </span>are the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters. “In the assembly of Korah,” </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with its </span>straightforward <span class="gemarra-regular">meaning. </span>It is clear from this verse that those in these categories were not entitled to a portion in Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara concludes: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage juxtaposes</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters to the spies, </span>so that Joshua and Caleb inherited the portions of both; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not juxtapose </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters to the spies.</span>
The Gemara presents Rav Pappa’s fourth question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Abaye: And according to the one who juxtaposes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters to the spies, </span>is it reasonable that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Caleb contested </span>the spies <span class="gemarra-regular">and inherited all of Eretz Yisrael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Many of the Jewish people protested in the wilderness at one point or another, and it cannot be that Joshua and Caleb received all of their portions by virtue of not participating in the sin of the spies. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We are referring to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">protesters who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were among the assembly of Korah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This term is not referring to all those who protested, but rather to the 250 individuals who protested along with Korah, and it is their portions of land that Joshua and Caleb received.
The Gemara returns to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and presents the fifth question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided among those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who left Egypt, this is as it is written </span>with regard to the inheritance of the tribe of Manasseh: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten parts fell to Manasseh, </span>beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons” (Joshua 17:5–6). <span class="gemarra-regular">Six </span>were the portions <span class="gemarra-regular">of the six fathers’ house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of Manasseh listed in a previous verse (Joshua 17:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>parts <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the daughters of Zelophehad; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>parts.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among</span> those <span class="gemarra-regular">who entered Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">there were eight </span>parts, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Six </span>were the portions <span class="gemarra-regular">of the six fathers’ </span><span class="gemarra-regular">houses, and two of theirs, </span>which they received from the estate of their grandfather Hepher, of whom Zelophehad was the firstborn; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight. </span>Zelophehad himself, by contrast, was not entitled to a portion, as he did not enter Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, but </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among those who left Egypt, there are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>parts, as the mishna (116b) states that Zelophehad’s daughters took three parts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say? </span>How can the mishna be reconciled with the verse? One must say that according to the opinion that Eretz Yisrael was divided among those who left Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">they had one </span>unmentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">paternal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uncle </span>who died without children, and Zelophehad’s estate received a share of his portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>according to the opinion that Eretz Yisrael was divided among those who entered Eretz Yisrael, it could be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">they had two</span> unmentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">paternal uncles, </span>so that they received two additional portions of land.
The fact that they received a portion from an uncle may be derived from a verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall give [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naton</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">titten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> a possession of an inheritance” (Numbers 27:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance of their father. </span>The verse continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Among their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father’s brothers”; this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their father’s father. </span>The verse continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall pass the inheritance of their father to them”; this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of the firstborn </span>to which Zelophehad was entitled.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov says: They also took a portion </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">their father’s brother, as it is stated: “You shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">give [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naton</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">titten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> The double expression indicates that they received an additional portion. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they had two paternal uncles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the phrase: “You shall give them <span class="gemarra-regular">a possession of an inheritance,” </span>which would be superfluous were it not to indicate an additional portion.
The Gemara presents the sixth question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>quoted above, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counting? If </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is counting children, </span>i.e., the portions of those who inherited from their antecedents, as with the daughters of Zelophehad, <span class="gemarra-regular">there were many </span>such portions, and the verse did not enumerate all portions inherited by all members of the tribe. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is counting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fathers’ houses, there are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">six, </span>as Hepher is included among the six enumerated in Joshua 17:2. Why, then, does the verse count the portions of the daughters of Zelophehad separately? 

Daf 119a

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is counting fathers’ houses. And </span>by also counting the inheritance of Zelophehad’s daughters, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us this: That </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters of Zelophehad took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the firstborn </span>due their father. <span class="gemarra-regular">Evidently, Eretz Yisrael is</span> considered already <span class="gemarra-regular">in possession </span>of one who was entitled to his portion of the land, even before the land was assigned. Although a firstborn son does not take a double portion of the property due to his deceased father as he does the property his father possessed, it is considered that Hepher possessed the portion that would eventually be assigned to him, and that Zelophehad was entitled to a double portion.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: And the sons </span>of the spies and of the protesters <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>portions of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the merit of their paternal grandfathers and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the merit of their maternal grandfathers </span>if those grandfathers were among those who left Egypt. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 7:10): The sons of the spies and of the protesters took portions <span class="gemarra-regular">in their own merit? </span>The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states they took portions in the merit of their grandfathers, is written <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who left Egypt; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that they took portions in their own merit, is written <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who entered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael.
The Gemara suggests another answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are written in accordance with the opinion that asserts that Eretz Yisrael was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">among those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entered Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>when the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, and therefore he took a portion in his own merit, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was not twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Zelophehad took an additional portion that he received from Hepher, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was a firstborn, </span>and a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes two portions </span>of inheritance from his father. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>was he entitled to the double portion of the firstborn? His portion of land <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> property merely <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to Hepher, as Hepher never actually possessed the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not take </span>a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>This clause of the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to tent pegs </span>and other assorted movable property that Hepher possessed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raises an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Zelophehad took four parts, as it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten parts fell to Manasseh” </span>(Joshua 17:5). Clearly, this is referring to portions of land, and not simply movable property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba says: Eretz Yisrael is </span>considered already <span class="gemarra-regular">in possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of one who was entitled to his portion of inheritance land, even before the land was assigned.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥideka said: Shimon HaShikmon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was my colleague among the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">students of Rabbi Akiva, and so would Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Even before turning to God for guidance, <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teacher knew that the daughters of Zelophehad were inheritors </span>and that they were entitled to their father’s portion, as well as his share in Hepher’s portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not know if they </span>were entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">take a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion of the firstborn </span>of Hepher’s portion <span class="gemarra-regular">or not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rabbi Ḥideka continues citing Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>concerning the laws <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheritances was fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to have been written through </span>God initiating a commandment to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses, </span>without mentioning Zelophehad’s daughters. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> by demonstrating their desire for land in Eretz Yisrael the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters of Zelophehad merited </span>that the portion was <span class="gemarra-regular">written through</span> a response to <span class="gemarra-regular">them.</span>
Rabbi Ḥideka continues citing Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Moses our teacher </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">knew that the </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">gatherer, </span>who gathered wood on Shabbat (see Numbers 15:32–36), was to be punished <span class="gemarra-regular">by death, as it is stated: “Every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one that profanes it shall be put to death” </span>(Exodus 31:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not know by which death </span>penalty the wood gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">must die. And the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>concerning the punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">gatherer was fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been written through </span>God initiating a commandment to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>to teach which form of court-imposed capital punishment is administered to one who violates Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">gatherer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">guilty, and </span>the portion was <span class="gemarra-regular">written through </span>the incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you</span>

Daf 119b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that merit is brought about by means of </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is meritorious and liability by means of </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable. </span>Accordingly, the daughters of Zelophehad merited that the Torah portion concerning a positive matter be written through them, and the wood gatherer deserved that a portion concerning a negative matter be written through him. This concludes Rabbi Ḥideka’s citation of Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni.
The Gemara states its objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael </span>was already <span class="gemarra-regular">in possession </span>of the Jewish people even before the land was assigned, <span class="gemarra-regular">what was </span>Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>about with regard to the right of Zelophehad’s daughters to collect a double portion; after all, Hepher’s portion in the land was in his possession, and Zelophehad was the firstborn?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is what Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">was uncertain </span>about, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> give it to you for a heritage [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">morasha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]: I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord” </span>(Exodus 6:8). Moses was unsure if the verse should be understood: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">erusha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you from your fathers, </span>such that it is considered in the possession of those who left Egypt; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>the verse indicates another matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the generation of those who left Egypt <span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">morishin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the portions to others <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not inherit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">oreshin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the portions themselves, because they are destined to die in the wilderness.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved</span> the question <span class="gemarra-regular">for him: </span>The verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance for you from your fathers </span>and is considered in your possession; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also the generation that left Egypt <span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath but they do not inherit. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written </span>in the song that the Jewish people sang after the splitting of the Red Sea: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You will bring them in, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance” </span>(Exodus 15:17). It <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated: You will bring us in, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rather: “You will bring them in,” </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>in their song, the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">were prophesying </span>that their generation would never enter Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what they were prophesying.</span>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident involving Zelophehad’s daughters. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation” </span>(Numbers 27:2). The Gemara asks: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>that Zelophehad’s daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">stood before Moses </span>and then Eleazar to ask their question, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said nothing to them; and </span>then the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">stood before the princes and all the congregation</span> to ask them? How would the princes or the congregation know an answer if Moses and Eleazar did not?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, transpose the verse and interpret it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> First, the daughters went to the congregation and ultimately came to Moses, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: </span>Those enumerated in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting in the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of study, and </span>Zelophehad’s daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">went and stood before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all of them </span>at once. They were not asked separately; rather, the order of the verse reflects their stature.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to what do they disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Abba Ḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">show honor to a student in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presence of the teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such that the verse would mention all the others even though they were in the presence of Moses; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoshiya, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not show </span>honor to a student in the presence of the teacher, such that only Moses would have been mentioned if they were all in the same place.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">show </span>honor to a student, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not show </span>honor. The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as there is a contradiction between <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: The contradiction between <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling, that one may show honor, was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">where his teacher </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">accords </span>the student <span class="gemarra-regular">honor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In such a case, others also may show the student honor. And <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling, that one may not show honor, was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">where his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not accord him honor.</span>
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: The daughters of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zelophehad are wise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are interpreters </span>of verses, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they are righteous.</span>
The Gemara proves these assertions. That <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wise </span>can be seen from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they spoke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the moment, </span>i.e., they presented their case at an auspicious time. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak says: </span>Tradition <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Moses our teacher was sitting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and interpreting in </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion about men whose married </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brothers had died childless, as it is stated: “If brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwell together, </span>and one of them dies, and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not be married abroad to one not of his kin; her husband’s brother shall come to her, and take her for him as a wife” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The daughters of Zelophehad <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">If we are </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">considered like a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son, give us </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance like a son; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, our mother should enter into levirate marriage. Immediately </span>upon hearing their claim, the verse records: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Moses brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their cause before the Lord” </span>(Numbers 27:5).
That <span class="gemarra-regular">they are interpreters </span>of verses can be seen from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they were saying: If </span>our father <span class="gemarra-regular">had had a son, we would not have spoken; </span>but because he had no son, we are filling the role of the heir. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: They would say, if he had had <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, </span>we would not have spoken? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Delete from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">Daughter. </span>As they were themselves daughters, this cannot have been their claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> need not be emended, and should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> daughter of a son </span>of Zelophehad, <span class="gemarra-regular">we would not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have spoken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for she would have been the heir.
That <span class="gemarra-regular">they are righteous </span>can be seen from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rush to <span class="gemarra-regular">marry, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>waited <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>marry those <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for them. Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Ya’akov teaches: Even the youngest </span>to be married <span class="gemarra-regular">among them was not married </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">less than forty years</span> of age.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say: </span>If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">marries </span>when she is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>she is able to <span class="gemarra-regular">give birth until </span>she reaches the age of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if she marries when she is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>or older, she is able to <span class="gemarra-regular">give birth until </span>she reaches the age of <span class="gemarra-regular">forty; </span>if she marries when she is <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>or older, she is <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer</span> able to <span class="gemarra-regular">give birth </span>at all. If so, how could Zelophehad’s daughters have waited until the age of forty to marry? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, since they are righteous women, a miracle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was performed for them, like </span>the one done for <span class="gemarra-regular">Jochebed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is written: “And a man of the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Levi went, and took as a wife a daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Levi” </span>(Exodus 2:1). 

Daf 120a

The Gemara asks: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>that this is Jochebed? Jochebed was then <span class="gemarra-regular">130 years old and </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">called</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her a daughter, </span>indicating one who is very young. Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of Jacob’s descendants who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: This </span>“daughter of Levi” is <span class="gemarra-regular">Jochebed, whose conception </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on the journey</span> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she was born within the walls, </span>i.e., having entered Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was born to Levi in Egypt” </span>(Numbers 26:59).
One can infer from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Her birth </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in Egypt, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but her conception was not in Egypt. </span>Since the Jewish people were in Egypt for 210 years and Moses was eighty years old at the time of the Exodus, Jochebed must have been 130 years old when Moses was born. The Gemara therefore asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>does the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">call</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her “a daughter”? Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">signs of youth </span>miraculously <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being </span>again. <span class="gemarra-regular">The flesh became smooth, the wrinkles were straightened out, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>youthful <span class="gemarra-regular">beauty returned to its place.</span>
The verse concerning Amram’s marriage to Jochebed states: “And a man of the house of Levi went, <span class="gemarra-regular">and took </span>as a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Since Jochebed had already been married to Amram for some years, as Miriam and Aaron were already born, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">took bac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> as a wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says: </span>The wording of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">performed for her </span>a formal <span class="gemarra-regular">act of marriag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as though he were marrying her for the first time. He <span class="gemarra-regular">seated her in </span>a bridal <span class="gemarra-regular">palanquin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’appiryon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Aaron and Miriam </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">singing before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ministering angels </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: “A joyful mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of children” </span>(Psalms 113:9).
§ The Gemara returns to discuss Zelophehad’s daughters: <span class="gemarra-regular">Later on, the verse lists the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their age, </span>stating: “For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married” (Numbers 36:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">and here </span>the verse lists them in a different order, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to their wisdom: </span>“And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah” (Numbers 27:1). This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami says: In </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting </span>in judgment or learning Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">follow </span>the participants’ <span class="gemarra-regular">wisdom </span>in determining the seating, so that the wisest is granted the highest honor, and <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">reclining</span> for a meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">follow </span>the participants’ <span class="gemarra-regular">age. Rav Ashi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: And this </span>is so only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">outstandin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in wisdom, </span>then wisdom trumps age; <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is so only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>one of the participants is <span class="gemarra-regular">outstanding in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">age, </span>i.e., particularly old, then age trumps wisdom.
The Gemara cites an alternative opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yishmael taught: The daughters of Zelophehad were equal </span>in stature, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, <span class="gemarra-regular">were [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vatihyena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> married.” The word “<span class="it-text">vatihyena</span>” demonstrates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was one </span>uniform <span class="gemarra-regular">existence [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">havaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., spiritual level, <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: The daughters of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zelophehad were permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to marry </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">of any of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribes, as it is stated: “Let them be married to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whom they think best” </span>(Numbers 36:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">But how do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I realize </span>the meaning of the continuation of the same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Only into the family of the tribe of their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father shall they be married” </span>(Numbers 36:6), according to which they were permitted to marry only members of their own tribe? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse offered them good advice, that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should be married only </span>to those <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for them, </span>who were often men from within the family.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught concerning the prohibition against eating consecrated foods while in a state of ritual impurity. Moses was commanded: “Say to them: Whoever will be of all your descendants throughout your generations, who approaches to the holy things, which the children of Israel consecrate to the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me” (Leviticus 22:3). Which people are referred to in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“say to them”? </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to those standing at Mount Sinai. </span>Which people are referred to in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“throughout your generations”? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">These are the coming generations. If </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fathers, why is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons, why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fathers? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">for the fathers that are not for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons, and there are </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sons that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not for the fathers.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">For the fathers, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And every daughter who possesses an inheritance </span>from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8). This mitzva, that the woman should marry a member of her own tribe, applied only to the first generation that received tribal portions of Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>by contrast, there were <span class="gemarra-regular">many mitzvot, </span>e.g., all the mitzvot that applied only from the time that Eretz Yisrael was settled, which <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons were commanded </span>to fulfill but <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fathers were not commanded </span>to fulfill. <span class="gemarra-regular">Because there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">for the fathers that are not for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons, and there are </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sons that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not for the fathers, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">needed to state, </span>i.e., to address, the <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers, </span>and it <span class="gemarra-regular">needed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">state, </span>i.e., to address, the <span class="gemarra-regular">sons.</span>
Rabba states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: For the fathers, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance </span>from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father.” This indicates that this was a mitzva for that entire generation, including Zelophehad’s daughters, in contrast to the statement of Shmuel. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he resolved it: </span>This mitzva applied to everyone <span class="gemarra-regular">except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the daughters of Zelophehad, </span>who were explicitly permitted to marry members of any tribe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master says </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">For the fathers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And every daughter who possesses an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance </span>from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father.” <span class="gemarra-regular">For the fathers, yes, </span>this is the mitzva, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sons, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred? Rava said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>there: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the matter </span>that the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 36:6), meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not be practiced except in this generation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is so, </span>then concerning the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“this is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter” </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered outside </span>the Tabernacle (see Leviticus 17:2–3), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>is it the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that it will not be practiced except in this generation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Certainly that is not so, as that prohibition applies in all generations. What is the difference between the two passages? Rav Ashi answered: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “Throughout their generations” </span>(Leviticus 17:7), indicating that the prohibition is in effect in all generations. 

Daf 120b

Rabba Zuti asked Rav Ashi about another instance of the same phrase. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">“this is the matter” </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heads of the tribes, </span>in the introductory verse to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of vows: “And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the matter that the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 30:2), is it <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be practiced except in this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">generation? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, that of vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived through </span>a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“this” </span>stated here, in the verse discussing vows, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“this” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the verse discussing offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, which is applicable in all generations.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, concerning the daughter inheriting her father’s portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derived through </span>a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“this” </span>stated here, with regard to inheritance, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“this” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the verse discussing offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The Gemara rejects that comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this </span>suggestion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple and with regard to vows, the phrase “this is the matter” <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary </span>for deriving other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> through <span class="gemarra-regular">a verbal analogy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as will be explained later. Therefore, the term may also be employed to teach that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies in all generations. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a daughter’s inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>other <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>this phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary? </span>If the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> truly applies for posterity, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the verse be silent </span>and refrain <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>addressing when this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies by not stating “this is the matter,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">know that it is for all generations, </span>as is the case with all other mitzvot.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy </span>for which the phrase was necessary? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated here, </span>with regard to vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the matter,” and it is stated there, </span>with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter.” Just as there </span>the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his sons and all Israel, so too here, </span>with regard to vows, the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and all Israel. And just as here </span>the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes, </span>as explicitly stated in the verse cited above, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too there, </span>with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, there is particular relevance to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says: Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>with regard to offerings, the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons and all Israel, so too here, </span>with regard to vows, the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his sons and all Israel. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is this verbal analogy stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ya’akov says: </span>This is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolution of vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> can be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">layme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> with no particular expertise in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of vows, just as the prohibition of offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple applies to all of the Jewish people, including laymen.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the heads of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribes” is written </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the portion of the vows, indicating that the matter is not entrusted to laymen. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Ḥisda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>in a different context: The mention of the heads of tribes teaches that vows may be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">by a single exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> halakhic authority; <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>here, this phrase teaches that vows can be nullified <span class="gemarra-regular">by a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> single expert </span>halakhic authority.
The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as here </span>the mitzva applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes, so too there, </span>with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, there is particular relevance to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> are the heads of the tribes linked to the prohibition of slaughtering offerings outside the Tabernacle or Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>This is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">requesting</span> dissolution of consecration <span class="gemarra-regular">of consecrated </span>property, just as one can request dissolution of a vow.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Shammai, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">requesting </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">of consecrated</span> property, this cannot explain the connection of the heads of the tribes to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nazir</span> 30b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Consecration </span>that one performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in erro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>nevertheless effective as <span class="gemarra-regular">consecration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because one’s mindset does not supersede his verbal declaration; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not consecration. </span>Accordingly, in the opinion of Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do they do with this </span>seemingly analogous usage of <span class="gemarra-regular">“this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” and “this,” </span>in the portions of offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple and vows, respectively?
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">require “this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the matter” </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">of offerings slaughtered outside </span>the Tabernacle or Temple to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<span class="it-text">karet</span>]; <span class="gemarra-regular">but he is not liable </span>to receive <span class="it-text">karet</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">pinching </span>the neck of a consecrated bird outside the Tabernacle or Temple, which is excluded from the category of slaughtering in this mitzva. And Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">require “this is the matter” </span>written of <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tribes </span>in the portion about vows <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority can dissolve </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">husband cannot dissolve </span>them. The halakhic authority can dissolve the vow for a petitioner, but a woman’s husband or father cannot dissolve her vow. And, conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> his wife’s or his daughter’s vows on the day that he hears the vow, regardless of her mindset, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a halakhic authority cannot nullify </span>vows in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Beit Shammai, who do not have </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning that they do not recognize as authoritative the verbal analogy that links vows to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do they </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolution of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vows </span>can be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by three laymen? </span>The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">derive it from that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states at the end of a passage relating to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the Festivals: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 23:44). In explaining the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: </span>

Daf 121a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord were stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, was not stated. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord were stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the dissolution of vows was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated. </span>This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara recounts: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Natan learned this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know how to explain it. </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">followed Rav Sheshet to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Neharde’a </span>in order to ask him about it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not find him </span>there. He <span class="gemarra-regular">followed him to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meḥoza </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">found him, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What</span> is meant by Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord were stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, was not stated? </span>What does he mean, as Shabbat of Creation is explicitly mentioned in that section of the Torah (Leviticus 23:3)?
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Festivals of the Lord require sanctification</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This means that the start of the month, which is dependent upon the appearance of the New Moon, which determines the Festivals, can be established only by a court composed of experts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, does not require sanctification by the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Shabbat is sanctified every week independent of any court action. It may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say: Since </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is written adjacent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Festivals, it should require sanctification by the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>do the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals. </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that Shabbat does not require this.
Rabbi Yosei bar Natan asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is meant by ben Azzai’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord were stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the dissolution of vows was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not stated? </span>After all, the Torah writes explicitly about the dissolution of vows. Rav Sheshet answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord require expert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to determine when the months begin and when the Festivals will be observed, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dissolution of vows does not require experts.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is written: “The heads of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tribes” </span>(Numbers 30:2), in the portion discussing the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of vows. How, then, can it be said that vows can be dissolved by laymen? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The phrase teaches that vows can be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">by a single expert </span>authority. In any event, the Gemara has established that Beit Shammai can derive that dissolution of vows can be performed by laymen in the manner stated by ben Azzai, as explained by Rav Sheshet.
§ The Gemara discusses a mishna that addresses the issue of inter-tribal marriages. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Ta’anit</span> 26b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days as joyous for the Jewish people as the fifteenth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Av and as Yom Kippur, as on these </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters of Jerusalem would emerge in white garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which each woman <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>from another. Why did they borrow garments? They did this <span class="gemarra-regular">so as not to embarrass one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who did not have </span>her own white garments. The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>is a day of joy, because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a day of pardon and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgiveness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and moreover, it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">day on which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the last Tablets </span>of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">were given. But what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the special joy of the <span class="gemarra-regular">fifteenth of Av?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>This was the <span class="gemarra-regular">day when </span>the members of different <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes were permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to marry </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">one another’s</span> tribe. Such marriages were restricted for the first generation to enter Eretz Yisrael, as discussed above (120a). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span> the sages of that time <span class="gemarra-regular">interpre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in support of their conclusion that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was no longer in effect? The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the matter” </span>(Numbers 36:6), meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter shall be practiced only in this generation,</span> in which Eretz Yisrael is being divided among the tribes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>offered another explanation: The fifteenth of Av was the <span class="gemarra-regular">day when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe of Benjamin was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to enter into the congregation </span>of the other tribes of Israel through marriage, after the other tribes found a way to dissolve the vow that had prohibited them from marrying a member of the tribe of Benjamin in the aftermath of the episode of the concubine in Gibeah (Judges, chapters 19–20). <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And the men of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying: None of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Judges 21:1). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the sages of that time <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>that enabled them to dissolve this vow? The verse states: “None <span class="gemarra-regular">of us,” and not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>None <span class="gemarra-regular">of our children; </span>therefore, the oath applied only to the generation that had taken the oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi bar Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>says: The fifteenth of Av was the <span class="gemarra-regular">day on which those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated to perish in the wilderness stopped </span>dying, as the entire generation that had left Egypt had died due to the sin of the spies (Numbers 14:29–30). <span class="gemarra-regular">As the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master says: As long as those designated to perish </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">wilderness had not stopped </span>dying, 

Daf 121b

God <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speak with Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “So it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came to pass, when all the men of war were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consumed and dead from among the people” </span>(Deuteronomy 2:16), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> juxtaposed to </span>that verse it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord spoke to me, saying” </span>(Deuteronomy 2:17). Moses indicates: Only after the last of that generation had died, <span class="gemarra-regular">was the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> speech </span>of God directed <span class="gemarra-regular">to me. </span>When the Jewish people realized that the decree had been lifted, the day was established as a permanent day of rejoicing.
The Gemara continues to cite explanations for the significance of the fifteenth of Av. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: </span>The fifteenth of Av was the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Hoshea, son of Ela, removed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">guards [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pardesaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Jeroboam, </span>son of Nevat, <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the roads</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that Israel </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not ascend </span>to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pilgrimage Festival. </span>By doing so, King Hoshea renewed the access to Jerusalem for pilgrims.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana says: </span>The fifteenth of Av was the <span class="gemarra-regular">day when the slain </span>victims <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beitar were afforded burial, </span>several years after they were killed and the Roman emperor Hadrian decreed that they were not to be buried (see <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 57a). <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mattana says: </span>On <span class="gemarra-regular">the day that the slain of Beita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were afforded burial, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">in Yavne instituted </span>the blessing: Blessed is He <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is good and Who does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">good</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is good, </span>is to give thanks <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the corpses <span class="gemarra-regular">did not decompose </span>despite the long delay; and the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Who does good, </span>is to give thanks <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the slain ones <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">afforded burial</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: </span>The fifteenth of Av is the <span class="gemarra-regular">day when they stop cutting woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the arrangement </span>of wood on the altar. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer the Great says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Once the fifteenth of Av came, the force of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sun would weaken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>from this date <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not cut </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">wood for the arrangement, </span>because wood cut from then on would not dry properly and would be unfit for use in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Menashe said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">called </span>the fifteenth of Av: The <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the breaking of the sickle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maggal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they did not need the lumbering tools until the following year.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>when the nights lengthen, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who adds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demosif </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to his nightly Torah study <span class="gemarra-regular">will add </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">osif </span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to his life, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he who does not add, </span>that person is <span class="gemarra-italic">yesif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">yesi</span><span class="gemarra-italic">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef teaches: </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother will bury him, </span>as he will die during his mother’s lifetime.
§ After discussing the generation of those who died in the wilderness, the Gemara mentions a tradition that relates to that generation. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: Seven </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">spanne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in their lifetimes <span class="gemarra-regular">the whole world in its entirety, </span>i.e., their lives have spanned all of human history. <span class="gemarra-regular">Methuselah saw Adam </span>in his lifetime; <span class="gemarra-regular">Shem saw Methuselah; Jacob saw Shem; Amram saw</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jacob; Ahijah the Shilonite saw Amram; Elija</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saw Ahijah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Shilonite; and </span>Elijah <span class="gemarra-regular">is still alive.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ahijah the Shilonite saw Amram? But it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And no man among them remained, save Caleb, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun” </span>(Numbers 26:65). Since Amram died well before the Jewish people left Egypt, in order to have lived at the time of Amram, Ahijah would have had to be an adult at the time of the Exodus. How, then, could he have lived through the generation of those who died in the wilderness?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hamnuna says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>of death pronounced for the generation of the spies <span class="gemarra-regular">was not decreed upon the tribe of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “Your carcasses shall fall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this wilderness, and all those who were counted among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and upward” </span>(Numbers 14:29). The verse is interpreted: The decree applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">one whose count </span>in the census <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the age of twenty </span>and up, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding the tribe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Levi, whose count is from the age of thirty </span>and up. Ahijah was a Levite, and he was not subject to the decree.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">from the other tribes entered </span>Eretz Yisrael? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Manasseh, and Machir, son of Manasseh, were born in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days of Jacob, and they did not die until the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the men of Ai killed of them about thirty-six </span><span class="gemarra-regular">men” </span>(Joshua 7:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>concerning this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Literally thirty-six </span>people were killed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: But is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty-six </span>were killed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing other than: “About thirty-six</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> were killed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>unusual term is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Yair, son of Manasseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the majority of the Sanhedrin, </span>whose maximum number of judges is seventy-one, of which thirty-six is a slight majority. Evidently, then, Yair, son of Manasseh also survived the time in the wilderness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>of death <span class="gemarra-regular">was not decreed either upon </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">less than twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old or upon </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">more than sixty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>at the time of the sin of the spies. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not upon </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">less than twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “From twenty years old and upward” </span>(Numbers 14:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">And not upon </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">more than sixty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>because he <span class="gemarra-regular">learns </span>that there is a verbal analogy between <span class="gemarra-regular">“and upward” </span>in the verse cited, and <span class="gemarra-regular">“and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upward” from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">valuations, </span>in the phrase: “From sixty years old and upward” (Leviticus 27:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>concerning valuations, <span class="gemarra-regular">more than sixty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old is comparable to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less than twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>as there is a distinct category of those between the ages of twenty and sixty, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, more than sixty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old is comparable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to less than twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>insofar as those older were not subject to the sentence. Yair, son of Manasseh, who was already older, did not die in the wilderness.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Was <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael divided according to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that each of the twelve tribes received an equal portion, and the members of each tribe divided these tribal portions according to their numbers; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>Eretz Yisrael was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to men’s skulls, </span>meaning that a certain area of land was given to each individual, and the size of the tribal allotments was a function of the tribe’s population? 

Daf 122a

The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof. The verse states: “According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided <span class="gemarra-regular">between the more and the fewer” </span>(Numbers 26:56). Evidently, whether the tribe had many or few people, the tribe as a whole received a portion equal to that of every other tribe, and each individual within the tribe received a different amount of land than those in other tribes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>another proof can be seen from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael is destined to be divided among thirteen tribes</span> during the messianic era, unlike the division in the time of Joshua. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, initially </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">among twelve tribes, </span>as the Torah does not allot a portion to the tribe of Levi. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only with money, </span>such that each tribe that received a portion more valuable than average compensated another tribe that had received a portion less valuable than average, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Between the more and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fewer.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>The area of land whose yield is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">in Judea </span>is so valuable that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>in value to the area necessary to produce <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Galilee.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only by a lottery, as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Only by lot </span>shall the land be divided” (Numbers 26:55). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only with </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “By the pronouncement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lot” </span>(Numbers 26:56).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>texts be reconciled? One indicates that the land was divided by lottery and the other indicates that the land was divided with the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar</span> the High Priest was <span class="gemarra-regular">dressed </span>with the <span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Joshua and all the Jewish people </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">standing before him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>a lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle </span>containing the names <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>another lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle </span>containing the names <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries</span> of the twelve different regions of Eretz Yisrael were <span class="gemarra-regular">placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">would ascertain </span>the assignments of land <span class="gemarra-regular">with the Divine Spirit and say, </span>in accordance with the notification of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>: The name of the tribe <span class="gemarra-regular">Zebulun </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges </span>from the receptacle in the lottery, and the region whose <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">Akko emerges with it</span> from the other receptacle. After stating this, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">mix</span> the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">in the receptacle of the tribes and </span>the lot of <span class="gemarra-regular">Zebulun </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge in his hand. </span>He would then <span class="gemarra-regular">mix </span>the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">in the receptacle of the boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Akko </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge in his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">would repeat </span>the process <span class="gemarra-regular">and ascertain </span>the assignments <span class="gemarra-regular">with the Divine Spirit and say: </span>The name of the tribe <span class="gemarra-regular">Naftali </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges, and </span>the region whose <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">Ginnosar emerges with it </span>from the other receptacle. After stating this, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">mix </span>the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receptacle of the tribes and </span>the lot of <span class="gemarra-regular">Naftali </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge in his hand. </span>He would then <span class="gemarra-regular">mix </span>the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">in the receptacle of the boundaries, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ginnosar </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge in his hand. And so </span>he would proceed for <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every tribe.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And unlike the division in this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world, </span>i.e., in the time of Joshua, will be the <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of portions <span class="gemarra-regular">in the World-to-Come, </span>i.e., in the messianic era. In <span class="gemarra-regular">this world, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person has a field of grain, he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have a field </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an orchard; </span>if he has <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an orchard, he does not have a field</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of grain. </span>This is so because each climate and variety of soil is suitable for a different type of produce. But <span class="gemarra-regular">in the World-to-Come, you do not have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any person who does not have </span>a portion in Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the valley, as it is stated: “The gate of Reuben</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the gate of Judah, one; the gate of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi, one” </span>(Ezekiel 48:31), which is to say that everyone’s portion will be the same. And <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He, will distribute it to them personally, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And these are their portions, says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord” </span>(Ezekiel 48:29). This is the conclusion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara states its proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: As initially</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only among </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve tribes. Conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was divided according to</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and not apportioned directly to each person. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is the case.
§ The Gemara returns to analyze the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> just cited. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael is destined to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be divided among thirteen tribes. </span>The Gemara asks: As to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>thirteenth portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom </span>is it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: For the king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they that serve the city, out of all the tribes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel, shall till it” </span>(Ezekiel 48:19). The verse is understood as meaning that the nation will collectively allot a portion to the king, who serves the needs of the nation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: </span>Why is the verse interpreted in this way? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the verse speaks of <span class="gemarra-regular">mere wages [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rongar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the king has rights to collect taxes, but not an actual portion of land. The Gemara answers: That possibility should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind, as it is written: “And the residue shall be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the prince, on the one side and on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other of the sacred offering and of the possession of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the city” </span>(Ezekiel 48:21). Based on this latter verse, the former verse speaks of a specific tract of land.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only with money, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Between the more and the fewer.” With regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is this said? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to beauty and ugliness, </span>i.e., that those who receive inferior-quality land received monetary compensation from the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">is that to say we are dealing with fools [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beshufetanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who would agree to take inferior-quality land in exchange for more money? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the difference between land that is <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>land that is <span class="gemarra-regular">far </span>from Jerusalem. Those whose property was close to Jerusalem compensated those whose property was farther away.
The Gemara notes: There <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> with regard to the manner by which this compensation was given: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The tribes <span class="gemarra-regular">compensated </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">with money. Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>The tribes <span class="gemarra-regular">compensated </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">with land </span>by giving extra land to those whose portions were in less advantageous locations.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">divided only by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a lottery, as it is stated: “Only by lot </span>shall the land be divided” (Numbers 26:55). The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>In the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“only by lot,” </span>the term “only” indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua and Caleb </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">excluded </span>from this proviso. The Gemara asks: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span>were they excluded? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say that </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">at all, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that it has already been taught that they <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the portions of the spies (118b) <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">not their</span> own, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that they took <span class="gemarra-regular">their own </span>portions? It goes without saying that they did collect their portions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the exclusion teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not take </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">by a lottery but according to </span>explicit designation by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “According to the commandment of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord they gave him the city that he asked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even Timnath Serah in the hill-country of Ephraim” </span>(Joshua 19:50). 

Daf 122b

The Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>concerning Joshua’s burial: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <span class="gemarra-regular">Serah” </span>(Joshua 24:30), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: </span>“And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <span class="gemarra-regular">Heres” </span>(Judges 2:9). Why is the name changed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar says: Initially, its fruits </span>were as dry <span class="gemarra-regular">as clay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keḥeres</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and ultimately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its fruits </span>were so plump that they were <span class="gemarra-regular">spoiling [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">masriḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span> the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>the fruits were <span class="gemarra-regular">spoiling </span>prematurely, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately, </span>they lasted as long <span class="gemarra-regular">as clay </span>without spoiling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Caleb </span>also received his portion directly from God and not through the lottery, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moses had spoken; and he drove out from there the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three sons of the giant” </span>(Judges 1:20). The Gemara asks about this verse: But <span class="gemarra-regular">Hebron was a city of refug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that belonged to the priests, as described in the book of Joshua (21:13); how could it have been given to Caleb? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Its outskirts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parvaraha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., only the fields and vineyards lying beyond the city limits, were given to Caleb. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession” </span>(Joshua 21:12).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Both the son and the daughter </span>of the deceased are included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance. But </span>the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son takes a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother. And </span>another difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sustaine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from the property of the father </span>after he dies, as it is a mandatory condition of their mother’s marriage contract that they are to be sustained even before the estate is disbursed to the children, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">are not sustained from the property of the mother, </span>which is all inherited by the sons.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by the first clause of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both the son and the daughter </span>of the deceased are included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance? If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit together, didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (115a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A son precedes a daughter? </span>Additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">all descendants of a son precede a daughter. </span>It is clear that a daughter does not inherit together with a son.
<span class="gemarra-italic">Nafsham</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mnemonic </span>for the names of the Sages cited in the following discussion: Naḥman; Pappa; Ashi; Mar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: This </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Both the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son and the daughter take in </span>inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span> to their father <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>they would take <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>inheritance the property that he had <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">possession.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">as wel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> in a mishna (116b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Zelophehad’s daughters took three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portions </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance </span>of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">Their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father’s portion </span>that he received <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was among </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those who left Egypt; and his portion </span>that he received <span class="gemarra-regular">with his brothers in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of Hepher, </span>their father, although Zelophehad predeceased his father and never was in possession of the inheritance from Hepher; and an additional portion that he received from Hepher because he was a firstborn. It is already taught in that mishna that property due to the deceased is inherited in the same manner as property possessed by the deceased.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to Rav Naḥman’s explanation, what is the contrast between the two clauses in the mishna?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Pappa said: This </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Both the son and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughter </span>of the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">take a portion of the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>this in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">as well </span>(116b), which explains the third portion taken by the daughters of Zelophehad: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they took an additional portion that he received from Hepher, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was a firstborn, </span>and a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes two portions </span>of inheritance from his father. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, </span>if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Pappa, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: This </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a son among the sons, and a daughter among the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughters, if </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>This particular child <span class="gemarra-regular">shall inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all my property, his statement stands. </span>A father can do so for any one son, or, when there are no sons, for any one daughter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion does Rav Ashi say this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches this later </span>(130a), as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Beroka says: If </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said about </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>that the named individual should inherit all his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands, </span>but if one said it <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">who is unfit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, his statement does not stand. </span>It is not reasonable to say that this mishna is stating the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that is recorded in the later mishna in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here taught us an unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span>in order to demonstrate that his opinion is accepted as <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, this would not establish the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with his opinion. The reason is that this would be an instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and thereafter </span>a mishnaic <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>concerning the same matter, as in the later mishna there is a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in an instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thereafter </span>a mishnaic <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the unattributed </span>mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Ashi, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: This </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Both the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son and the daughter are equal </span>in their rights both <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the mother and with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the father. </span>Sons and daughters can inherit from either fathers or mothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the differences are that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son takes a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the property of the father, and he does not take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property of the mother, </span>and that the daughters are sustained from their father’s estate before it is disbursed to the children, but they are not sustained from the property of their mother.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But he shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him a double portion of all that he has” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17), this means the firstborn receives <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>any other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>inheritor. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> analyzes this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you say </span>the firstborn receives <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>inheritor, <span class="gemarra-regular">or rather, is it a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all the property, </span>such that the firstborn receives two-thirds of the entire estate, which is twice the portion left for the other inheritors to divide between themselves? The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>question can be resolved through <span class="gemarra-regular">logical inference: </span>

Daf 123a

There may be times when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with one </span>other brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there may be times when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with five </span>brothers, and there is no indication that the Torah differentiates between the manner in which the respective firstborns collect in each scenario. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion, </span>dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with one</span> other brother, he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>inheritor, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with five </span>brothers, he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>inheritor.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> suggests the opposite logical derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">go this way: </span>There may be times when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with one </span>other brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there may be times when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with five </span>brothers. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his portion, </span>dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other brother, he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the property, so too </span>when a firstborn takes <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>of the inheritance, dividing the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">with five </span>brothers, he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all the property.</span>
As the logical inference can lead to either conclusion, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is determined by a derivation from a verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Then it shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:16). As the next verse spells out: “But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the former verse is ostensibly redundant. The additional verse is therefore understood as an inclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">increased inheritance with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, </span>indicating that the more brothers there are, the greater the portion they collect from the entire estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, you should not reason in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with the final formulation, </span>in which the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> suggests that the firstborn inherits twice as much as all the other brothers combined, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in accordance with the first formulation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>according to which the firstborn inherits twice as much as each other brother.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reinforces this statement by citing additional verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the firstborn; but, inasmuch as he defiled his father’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> couch, his birthright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekhorato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] was given to the sons of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Joseph the son of Israel, yet not so that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was to be reckoned in the genealogy as firstborn” </span>(I Chronicles 5:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the following verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Judah prevailed above his brothers, and the prince came of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him; but the birthright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehabekhora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] was Joseph’s” </span>(I Chronicles 5:2).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> derives: <span class="gemarra-regular">Birthright, </span>i.e., firstborn status, <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Joseph, and birthright is stated </span>in another verse concerning the double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the later <span class="gemarra-regular">generations: </span>“By giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the birthright [<span class="it-text">habekhora</span>] is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the birthright stated with regard to Joseph </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>inheritor, as the Gemara will explain, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too the birthright stated with regard to </span>the later <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>inheritor.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites additional related verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to Jacob’s bequest to Joseph, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Moreover I have given to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one portion above your brothers, which I took out of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my bow” </span>(Genesis 48:22). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his sword and with his bow? But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> already stated: </span>“Through You do we push down our adversaries; through Your name do we trample those that rise against us. <span class="gemarra-regular">For I trust not in my bow, neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can my sword save me” </span>(Psalms 44:6–7)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>what is the meaning of “with <span class="gemarra-regular">my sword”? This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> What is the meaning of “with <span class="gemarra-regular">my bow”? This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">petition. </span>This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites additional proofs, introducing them with the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the proof from the verse: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit” is not valid, as perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to </span>teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka </span>that a father may designate property for whichever child he desires, then <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a separate proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of Reuben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the firstborn of Israel…</span>his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel.” As Joseph’s birthright was that his sons received two portions, evidently the birthright of the firstborn is that he receives double the amount received by one inheritor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that this is not a proof either, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derive </span>the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Birthright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekhora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(see Deuteronomy 21:17) <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the similar but not identical term of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His birthright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekhorato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the term employed in the following phrase from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the birthright [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehabekhora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] was Joseph’s.”</span>
The Gemara continues to explicate the biblical citations in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that this is not a proof either, as concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph himself, from where </span>may it be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his birthright <span class="gemarra-regular">was double </span>the property received <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>inheritor? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Moreover I have given to you one portion above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your brothers,” </span>indicating that Joseph received one more portion than each of the other sons of Jacob.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: </span>Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the term “one portion” is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mere palm tree </span>or some other relatively small extra gift, instead of a full, equal share? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For you, </span>i.e., to answer your question, the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: “Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be mine” </span>(Genesis 48:5). Evidently, Joseph’s children together received portions equal to that of Reuben and Simeon together, i.e., two full portions.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jacob see that he took </span>the status as <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Reuben and gave it to Joseph? </span>The Gemara wonders: What does he mean, <span class="gemarra-regular">what did </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">see? </span>The matter is <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But, inasmuch as he defiled his father’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s couch, </span>his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph” (I Chronicles 5:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Ḥelbo’s question was: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did he see that he gave it </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Joseph?</span>
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani answered Rabbi Ḥelbo: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will tell you a parable. To what is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter comparable? To a homeowner who raised an orphan in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his home. Eventually, that orphan became wealthy and said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will provide benefit to the homeowner from my property. </span>Similarly, since Joseph sustained Jacob in Egypt for a number of years, Jacob saw fit to repay the kindness. Rabbi Ḥelbo <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And if Reuben did not sin, </span>would Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">not have provided any benefit to Joseph? </span>It cannot be that Jacob repaid Joseph only as a result of Reuben’ sin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, doesn’t your teacher Rabbi Yonatan say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like this: It was appropriate for </span>the child receiving the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn to emerge from Rachel, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph” </span>(Genesis 37:2), indicating that Joseph was Jacob’s primary progeny. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Leah advanced </span>ahead of Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>appeals for <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy, </span>i.e., with prayer, and thereby earned the status as firstborn for her firstborn. <span class="gemarra-regular">But because of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">modesty that Rachel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, returned </span>the status as firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">to her. </span>This is why Jacob gave the status as firstborn to Joseph.
The Gemara explains this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does it mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">Leah advanced </span>ahead of Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">with mercy? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And Leah’s eyes were weak [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 29:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that her eyes were <span class="gemarra-regular">literally weak, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>that the verse would say that? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">did not speak to the disparagement of </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">kosher animal, as it is written: “From the pure animals </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and from the animals that are lacking purity” </span>(Genesis 7:8). The verse states: “That are lacking purity” rather than stating explicitly and disparagingly: That are impure. If that is so with regard to animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">did the verse speak </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, Rabbi Elazar says:</span> The term alludes to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that her gifts, </span>i.e., the gifts given to her descendants, e.g., the priesthood and the monarchy, <span class="gemarra-regular">were long-lasting [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they were passed down from generation to generation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that there is a different explanation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the verse means that her eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">were literally weak, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a denigration</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of her but a praise of her. As she would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hear people at the crossroads, </span>coming from the land of Canaan, <span class="gemarra-regular">who would say: Rebecca has two sons, </span>and her brother <span class="gemarra-regular">Laban has two daughters; </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">older </span>daughter will be married <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">older </span>son, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">younger </span>daughter will be married <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">younger </span>son.
Rav continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And she would sit at the crossroads and ask: What</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">the deeds of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">older </span>son? The passersby would answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is an evil man, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">robs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people. </span>She would ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">the deeds of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">younger </span>son? They would answer: He is <span class="gemarra-regular">“a quiet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man, dwelling in tents” </span>(Genesis 25:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>because she was so distraught at the prospect of marrying the evil brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">she would cry </span>and pray for mercy <span class="gemarra-regular">until her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eyelashes fell out. </span>Since the weakness of her eyes was due to this cause, characterizing her eyes as weak constitutes praise. This is Leah’s prayer for mercy to which Rabbi Yonatan referred.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>her desire not to marry Esau is the basis of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And the Lord saw that Leah was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hated, </span>and He opened her womb” (Genesis 29:31). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“hated”? If we say </span>that she was <span class="gemarra-regular">literally hated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is it <span class="gemarra-regular">possible? The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">did not speak to the disparagement of </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-kosher animal, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">did the verse </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">speak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He, saw that the behavior of Esau </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was hated by her, </span>and therefore: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He opened her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> womb.”</span>
The Gemara now explains the second part of Rabbi Yonatan’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>was a demonstration of the <span class="gemarra-regular">modesty that Rachel possessed? As it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and that he was Rebecca’s son” </span>(Genesis 29:12). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t he the son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her father’s sister? </span>Why did he say that he was her father’s brother? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Jacob and Rachel had the following exchange: Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rachel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Will you marry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me? </span>Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, but </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a deceitful person, and you cannot defeat him.</span>
Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: What is his </span>method of <span class="gemarra-regular">deceit </span>of which I need be aware? Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I have a sister who is older </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than me, and he will not marry me </span>off <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span> he marries <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>off, even if he promises that he will do so. Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: I am </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his brother, </span>i.e., equal, <span class="gemarra-regular">in deceit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he will not be able to deceive me. That is why Jacob said that he was “her father’s brother.” Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But is it permitted for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">righteous to act deceitfully? </span>Jacob answered her: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>in certain circumstances. As the verse states concerning God: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With the pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You show</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yourself subtle” </span>(II Samuel 22:27). Therefore, to counter Laban’s deceit, Jacob <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>Rachel secret <span class="gemarra-regular">signs </span>to prove to him that she was the one marrying him.
Laban did in fact attempt to have Jacob marry Leah instead of marrying Rachel. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Laban’s associates <span class="gemarra-regular">were bringing Leah up </span>to the wedding canopy to marry Jacob, Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">thought: Now my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sister will be humiliated </span>when Jacob discovers that she is the one marrying him. Therefore, Rachel <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the signs <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> Leah. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is as it is written: “And it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Leah” </span>(Genesis 29:25). This verse is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inference, </span>should one derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that until now she was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Leah? Rather, through the signs that Jacob gave to Rachel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that she gave to Leah, he did not know </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">she until that moment. </span>This is the modesty of Rachel to which Rabbi Yonatan was referring.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s family. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Ḥalifa Karoya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: In the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> total </span>tally of Jacob’s family members who descended to Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find seventy, </span>as stated in the verse: “All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">in their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individual </span>listing, when the family members of each of his sons are listed by name, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find seventy-less-one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>How can this be resolved? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: A twin </span>sister <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>born <span class="gemarra-regular">with Dinah, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his daughter Dinah” </span>(Genesis 46:15). The term <span class="it-text">et</span> implies an unspecified additional person. Abba Ḥalifa Karoya replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>one would have to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a twin </span>sister <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>born <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Benjamin, as it is written: </span>

Daf 123b

“And he lifted up his eyes, and saw <span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Benjamin his brother, his mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son” </span>(Genesis 43:29), which would render the count of seventy in-correct. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>There <span class="gemarra-regular">was a goodly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pearl [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">margalit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in my hand, and you are trying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to have me lose it. </span>He continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">So said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: This </span>missing seventieth person is <span class="gemarra-regular">Jochebed, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose conception was on the journey, </span>as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she was born within the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walls, </span>i.e., in Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who was born to Levi in Egypt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 26:59). <span class="gemarra-regular">Her birth </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in Egypt, but her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conception </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not in Egypt. </span>Accordingly, the family had seventy persons upon arrival, but she could not have been listed as descending to Egypt.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥmani: It is written: “And it came to pass, when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rachel gave birth to Joseph, </span>that Jacob said to Laban: Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country” (Genesis 30:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">What was different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when Joseph was born, </span>that Jacob decided only then to return home? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Jacob</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our patriarch saw </span>prophetically <span class="gemarra-regular">that the descendants of Esau </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">delivered only to the hand of the descendants of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Joseph, as it is stated: “And the house of Jacob</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flame, and the house of Esau for straw, </span>and they shall kindle in them, and devour them” (Obadiah 1:18). Jacob had left Eretz Yisrael to escape Esau, but he now felt confident that he could return without endangering his family.
Rabbi Ḥelbo <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: Concering a battle between the Jewish people and the nation of Amalek, who descend from Esau, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And David smote them from the twilight even to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the evening of the next day” </span>(I Samuel 30:17). David was from the tribe of Judah, yet he was able to defeat the descendants of Esau. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Whoever read </span>and taught <span class="gemarra-regular">Prophets to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not read </span>and teach <span class="gemarra-regular">Writings to you, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “As he went to Ziklag, there fell to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were of Manasseh, </span>and they helped David against the troop” (I Chronicles 12:21–2). The verse in Writings teaches that David’s campaign against Esau was led by Joseph’s descendants, from the family of Manasseh.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raises an objection: </span>Another verse indicates that the descendants of Simeon also have the ability to defeat the descendants of Esau: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And some of them, even of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to Mount </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Ne’ariah, and Rephaiah, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. And they struck the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remnant of the Amalekites that escaped, and dwelled there until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this day” </span>(I Chronicles 4:42–43). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Sheila said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ishi came from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">children of Manasseh, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: And the sons of Manasseh: Hepher and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ishi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 7:4–5): <span class="gemarra-regular">The firstborn </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">takes a double</span> portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the foreleg, and of the jaw, and of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the maw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are given to a priest from all slaughtered non-sacred cattle, sheep, and goats (see Deuteronomy 18:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a firstborn, whether he is a priest or non-priest, takes a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>his father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">and of the enhancement of the property </span>that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death of their father.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>To what type of enhancement is this referring? If <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cow </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">leased or rented in the possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of others, or if it was grazing in the meadow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it gave birth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a double </span>portion of the rental income or of the calf. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the inheritors <span class="gemarra-regular">built homes or planted vineyards</span> after their father’s death, thereby enhancing the property, the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn does not take a double </span>portion. This is not considered enhancement of the father’s property, but profit due to their actions.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>right to collect a double portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw, what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the circumstances? If </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">came into the possession of their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the firstborn collects a double portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession of their father, </span>then these items <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>merely property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to their father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the firstborn does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property his father <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are dealing with associates of the priesthood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., people who have an arrangement with a specific priest to give him their priestly gifts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was slaughtered while the father was alive, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: </span>Priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">separate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are considered as though they </span>have already been <span class="gemarra-regular">separated. </span>Therefore, even though the gifts were not yet given, they were considered in the possession of the priest before his death.
The Gemara continues to analyze the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Why does the firstborn take a double portion of the father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals? Isn’t it so that once the father consecrates them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>belong to Heaven and <span class="gemarra-regular">are not his?</span>
The Gemara answers: This is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lesser sanctity, </span>such as peace offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with</span> the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says: </span>These sacrificial animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">owners, </span>as opposed to property of Heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And commits a trespass against the Lord, </span>and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include offerings of lesser sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">owners; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaGelili. </span>Consequently, the firstborn collects a double portion of these as well.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them a cow </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">leased or rented in the possession of others, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it was grazing in the meadow, and it gave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> birth, </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes a double </span>portion of the rental income or calf. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that in a case where the cow was <span class="gemarra-regular">leased or rented </span>to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are not in their owner’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession, you say </span>that the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>a double portion, in a case where it was <span class="gemarra-regular">grazing in the meadow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to state that he receives a double portion?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: </span>It teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a case where the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">leased or rented</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is similar to </span>a case where it was <span class="gemarra-regular">grazing in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the meadow, </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>in a case where it was <span class="gemarra-regular">grazing in the meadow, the enhancement came by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself and </span>the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">did not lose </span>money for <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sustenance, </span>

Daf 124a

<span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>in the case of a cow that was <span class="gemarra-regular">leased or rented, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring only to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement came by itself, as</span> the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">did not lose </span>money for <span class="gemarra-regular">its sustenance, </span>since it was stipulated that the one who rented or leased it would provide its feed.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 7:4): <span class="gemarra-regular">A firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the enhancement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the property </span>that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death of </span>the sons’ <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn does take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the enhancement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the property </span>that occurred by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">after their father’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s death, </span>e.g., the birth of a calf, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not of the enhancement that the orphans caused after </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their father’s death.</span>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: Therefore, if they <span class="gemarra-regular">inherited a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">promissory note </span>indicating a debt owed to their father, the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes a double </span>portion of the money when it is collected, as this is an enhancement to the estate that came by itself. The Gemara adds: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a promissory note emerged against the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> for their father’s debt, the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn gives, </span>i.e., repays, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">double </span>portion of the debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he says: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">am not giving </span>a double portion of the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I am not taking </span>a double portion of the estate, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to do so, and he is exempt from paying a double portion.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>that the firstborn does not receive a double portion of any enhancements that occur after the death of the father? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Giving him a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double portion” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17); by employing the term “giving” <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One calls </span>the double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift. Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a recipient of a gift does not acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gift unless it </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">reaches the possession of </span>the one giving the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>the firstborn does not acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of the firstborn unless it has reached the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession of </span>the father before he died.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the reason for his ruling that a firstborn receives a double portion of the enhancement is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “A double </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portion” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17). It <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes the portion of the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the portion of an ordinary </span>son, in that <span class="gemarra-regular">just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the portion of an ordinary </span>son is inherited <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> from property <span class="gemarra-regular">that did not reach </span>the father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession</span> before he died, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the portion of the firstborn</span> is inherited <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>from property <span class="gemarra-regular">that did not reach </span>the father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>before he died.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well, isn’t </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“a double portion” written? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>phrase can be said to teach a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, requiring the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>the firstborn both of his portions <span class="gemarra-regular">on one border</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., adjoining, and not in separate locations.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, isn’t </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“giving him” written? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> phrase can be said to teach a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I am not taking </span>a double portion of the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not giving </span>a double portion of the debt, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to do so. Since the inheritance is referred to as a gift, he has the right to refuse it.
The Gemara discusses several types of enhancement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree that </span>became enhanced by <span class="gemarra-regular">growing broader </span>after the father’s death, or <span class="gemarra-regular">land that yielded sil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and thereby became enhanced, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agrees that </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>a double portion of the enhancement. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when fodder</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baḥafura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., grain that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes full ears, </span>of grain, and when <span class="gemarra-regular">date flowers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shelofafei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become </span>fully developed <span class="gemarra-regular">dates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that since this <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>develops <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>the firstborn is entitled to a double portion of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that since the item <span class="gemarra-regular">transformed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is not considered the same item that was in the father’s possession, and the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya says: </span>A judge who <span class="gemarra-regular">acted, </span>i.e., ruled, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">has acted </span>legally, and one who acted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">acted </span>legally. Either way, the decision stands. 

Daf 124b

The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">is uncertai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as to <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the principle that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with his colleague </span>applies specifically to a dispute with one other <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>to a dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>several of <span class="gemarra-regular">his colleagues, or </span>whether the principle that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with his colleague </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even to </span>a dispute with several of <span class="gemarra-regular">his colleagues, </span>as in this case, where the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Since he was uncertain, he left the decision to each individual judge.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to act </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">colleague, but not </span>in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> several of <span class="gemarra-regular">his colleagues.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says his own </span>statement: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to act in accordance with the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi not only in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">colleague,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but even </span>in his disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>several of <span class="gemarra-regular">his colleagues</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> act in accordance with the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>a judge <span class="gemarra-regular">acted </span>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what is done <span class="gemarra-regular">is done </span>and the decision stands. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is incline</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to follow the opinion of the Rabbis <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, but if a judge rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, his decision stands.
The Gemara comments that there are conflicting opinions in halakhic midrash as to whether the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as each opinion is supported by a different version of the midrash. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from the other books of the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">debei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a volume of halakhic midrash other than <span class="it-text">Torat</span> <span class="it-text">Kohanim</span>, which is a halakhic midrash on the book of Leviticus. The phrase from the verse: “By giving him a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes the enhancement that the heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought about after their father’s death, </span>of which the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement of the property </span>that occurred by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">after their father’s death, he does take</span> a double portion. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama taught</span> a different version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from the other books</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the school of Rav: “Of all that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has” excludes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the property </span>that occurred by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">after their father’s death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> of which the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And all the more so, he does not take</span> a double portion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement that the heirs brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about after their father’s death. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis. </span>Accordingly, there is a discrepancy between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> as to whether the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis or Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: A firstborn does not take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a loan, </span>i.e., of a debt that is owed to the father. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to whom </span>is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis say </span>that a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take </span>a double portion even with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>of property <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is in the possession of </span>the father, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to state that he is not entitled to a double portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan? </span>The debt is not in the father’s possession at the time of his death; it is merely due to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. Although he holds that a firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the enhancement of the property itself, he concedes that he is not entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt, as it was not in the possession of his father at the time of his death.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the sons <span class="gemarra-regular">inherited a promissory note, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and the interest? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Shmuel’s statement that the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt is <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary </span>to state it. It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan, since </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, it is considered as though it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been collected </span>and is in the creditor’s possession, so too, the firstborn should be entitled to a double portion even according to the opinion of the Rabbis. Therefore, Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the loan is not considered to be in the creditor’s possession, and the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">They sent </span>the following ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>Eretz Yisrael: If the father lent money to a gentile, the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes a double </span>portion of the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">interest, </span>as the interest is considered property due to the father.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to whom </span>is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say </span>that a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take </span>a double portion even with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>of property, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession of </span>the father, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that they would hold that he is not entitled to a double portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan? </span>Since the debt is not in the father’s possession at the time of his death, as it is merely due to him, the rabbis would certainly not hold that the firstborn takes a double portion of it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, is it so that the firstborn is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entitled to a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interest? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A firstborn takes a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of both </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the loan </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interest?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> sent from the Sages of Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that the Rabbis concede that the firstborn receives a double portion of the value of the loan itself, because <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered as though it has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been collected </span>and is in the creditor’s possession. By contrast, the interest on the loan is not considered as though it is already in the creditor’s possession, and therefore the firstborn does not receive a double portion of its payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav said to Ravina: Ameima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrived at our locale </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn takes a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">interest. </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a</span> conform <span class="gemarra-regular">to their </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Ameimar followed the opinion of Rav Naḥman, who was one of the Sages of Naharde’a, as was Ameimar.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabba says: </span>If the sons <span class="gemarra-regular">collected land </span>as payment of a debt owed to their father, the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>a double portion of it, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collected money, he does not have </span>a double portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman says </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected money, he has</span> a double portion, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected land, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>a double portion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: According to your </span>opinion it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">According to your </span>opinion it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult</span>

Daf 125a

because <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>resulting in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the firstborn is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entitled to a double portion of it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">that their father did not leave </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>that was collected. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">land as well, their father did not leave </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>when he died, as the debtor could have repaid them with a different parcel of land, or with money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">aren’t you </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the explanation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the people of the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable? </span>In a case where a married woman had been fit to inherit from her great-grandmother but then predeceased her great-grandmother, who then died, and her widower claims the inheritance in his late wife’s stead, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael ruled that he is not entitled to the inheritance, as it is merely property due to his wife, and a husband does not inherit property due to be inherited by his late wife. Rabba agreed that the inheritance is considered property due to the wife, and not property possessed by her, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if the </span>great-<span class="gemarra-regular">grandmother would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sold it before </span>she died, <span class="gemarra-regular">her sale would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. </span>Here, too, the land should be considered property due to the father, of which a firstborn is not entitled to a double portion, since the debtor could have sold it. Therefore, Rabba’s opinion is difficult.
Abaya continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult; what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>resulting in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the firstborn is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entitled to a double portion of it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">that their father did not leave</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">money as well, their father did not leave </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>when he died.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, doesn’t Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who collected lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a debt owed to their father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">come and seize this </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, </span>as any land owned by the father is liened against his debts. Evidently, Rav Naḥman holds that land liened against a debt has the legal status of land that is in the possession of the creditor. If so, why does Rav Naḥman hold that a firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of land that is collected as payment of a debt?
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to my </span>opinion it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult, and according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult. We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">saying, </span>i.e., explaining, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the people of the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, introduced with the phrase: They sent the following ruling from there, that a firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But we ourselves do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not hold </span>in accordance with that opinion. Therefore, one cannot raise a contradiction from our opinions stated elsewhere to what we said in explanation of the Sages of Eretz Yisrael.
Having mentioned in passing the case of the great-grandmother, the Gemara discusses that case in depth. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the case of the great-<span class="gemarra-regular">grandmother </span>that was mentioned by Abaye? The Gemara explains: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>moribund person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>those present: 

Daf 125b

All <span class="gemarra-regular">my property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">grandmother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and after she </span>dies, it is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heirs, </span>not inherited by her heirs. He then died. <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a married daughter, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">died during the lifetime of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her husband and during the lifetime of </span>her father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">grandmother. After </span>her father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">grandmother died, </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and claimed </span>the inheritance, as his wife was the heir of her father, and he is his wife’s heir.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>When her father said that his property is given: <span class="gemarra-regular">To my heirs, </span>he meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even to the heirs of my heirs. </span>Therefore, since his daughter’s husband is the heir of his heir, he is entitled to the inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Anan said</span> that he meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">To my heirs, but not to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heirs of my heirs. </span>Therefore, the husband is not entitled to the property.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">They sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan, but not due to his reasoning. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan that the husband does not inherit </span>the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But not due to his reasoning, as Rav Anan holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if his daughter had a son </span>to inherit from her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not inherit </span>the property, as her father bequeathed it only to his heirs, not to the heirs of his heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if his daughter had a son, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly inherit; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and this is the reason the husband does not inherit: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the daughter, as she did not own it during her lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a husband does not take </span>in inheritance property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property she <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, does Rav Huna, </span>who ruled that the husband is entitled to the inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes </span>in inheritance property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property she <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: This matter was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> introduced by great </span>Sages, namely Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and concluded by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lesser </span>Sages, i.e., by me. Rabbi Elazar, humbly referring to himself as a lesser Sage, will now explain Rav Huna’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who says </span>to another upon granting him an inheritance or a gift: <span class="gemarra-regular">After you </span>die it is given to so-and-so, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: </span>It is given to so-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">from now. </span>The first recipient merely has the right to use the property during his lifetime but did not actually become the owner. Accordingly, the inheritance was owned by the daughter in her lifetime, and the great-grandmother merely had usage rights. Therefore, it is inherited by the husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> explanation of the people of the West, </span>that the inheritance is considered property due to the daughter and not property possessed by her, <span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable, as if the grandmother </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would have sold it before </span>she died, <span class="gemarra-regular">her sale would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have been </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the daughter would not have received it at all.
In conclusion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Papp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take </span>in inheritance property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property she <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed; and a firstborn does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>a double portion of property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to his father <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property his father <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a firstborn does not take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">collected land </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they collected money. </span>

Daf 126a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is with </span>the firstborn, i.e., he had borrowed money from his father then his father died, it is uncertain whether the payment should be considered property due to the father or property possessed by him. Therefore, the firstborn and his brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">divid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the additional portion.
§ With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of the enhancement of the property resulting from the actions of the heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn who proteste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the efforts of enhancing the property before it is divided has <span class="gemarra-regular">protested, </span>and if the brothers use resources from the estate to enhance it against his will, he is entitled to a double portion of the enhanced value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Rav Asi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s opinion is reasonable in </span>a case where they inherited <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>on a grapevine <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">harvested the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> against the will of the firstborn, or if they inherited <span class="gemarra-regular">olives </span>on olive trees <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">harvested them, </span>as in these cases, the produce itself did not change. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they treaded </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>converting them into wine or oil, even if the firstborn protested their doing so, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entitled to a double portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Even </span>if they <span class="gemarra-regular">treaded </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>the firstborn is entitled to a double portion.
The Gemara asks: Why is he entitled to a double portion, according to Rav Yosef, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">they treaded </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">them? </span>Since the brothers transformed the produce, as <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>it was in the form of <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>they have acquired it in the same manner that a thief acquires an item he stole. Therefore, the firstborn should have no share of the enhancement.
The Gemara answers: Rav Yosef did not mean that the firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the enhanced value of the wine. Rather, his intention was the same <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Ukva bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama says </span>in a differnet context, that the ruling is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the wine spoiled, its value decreasing to below the initial value of the grapes, in which case the brothers must <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>additional portion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes. Here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>Rav Yosef meant that the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">must give </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage to his grapes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where, </span>i.e., in what context, <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ukva bar Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to that which Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ordinary </span>son <span class="gemarra-regular">whose father left them grapes and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> harvested them, </span>or if he left them <span class="gemarra-regular">olives and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> harvested them, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn takes a double </span>portion. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they treaded </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>The Gemara asks: Why is he entitled to a double portion if <span class="gemarra-regular">they treaded </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">them; initially </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">wine? Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says: </span>Shmuel did not mean that he is entitled to a double portion of the wine; rather, the reference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the wine spoiled, its value decreasing to below the initial value of the grapes, in which case the ordinary brother must <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">his grapes.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: A firstborn who took a portion</span> of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>heir has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his right to an additional portion. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does it mean that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his additional portion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says in the name of Rava </span>that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his additional portion only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to that field </span>that was divided, since he did not exercise his right to an additional portion, but he has not relinquished his right to receive an additional portion of the rest of the estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Papp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rava </span>that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the property.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rava </span>that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his additional portion only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that field </span>that was divided, because he <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn does not have </span>a right to his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">divisio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has waived </span>his additional portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">what has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">reached his possession, </span>namely, the field that was divided, but he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not waived </span>his portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>fields of the estate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappi says in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rava </span>that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the property, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn has </span>a right to his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>field, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has waived</span> his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of all </span>of the property.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As</span> there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain firstborn who went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sold his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property and </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>his deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary </span>brother, i.e., their respective portions of their father’s property, before the property was divided. The <span class="gemarra-regular">orphan sons of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary</span> brother <span class="gemarra-regular">went to eat dates from </span>the field that was now in the possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">those purchasers, </span>due to their father’s share in the field. The purchasers <span class="gemarra-regular">hit them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as though they were thieves. The <span class="gemarra-regular">relatives </span>of the orphans <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the purchasers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not only did you purchase their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property </span>illegally, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you now hit them as well? They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came before Rava, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>The firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> done nothing. </span>His sale was not valid. 

Daf 126b

Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa disagree with regard to Rava’s intention. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Pappi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> done nothing with regard to </span>his brother’s <span class="gemarra-regular">portion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he had no right to sell it; with regard to his own additional portion, the sale was valid, as it was in his possession even before the division of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Pappa, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that he has done nothing <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all </span>of the property, as he does not possess the additional portion before the property is divided between the brothers.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">A firstborn who sold </span>his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">divisio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">has done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nothing. Apparently, </span>the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn does not have </span>a right to his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">division. But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>a right to his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">division.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra of</span> the house <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rishba, </span>who was a firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">divided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a basket of pepper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the estate of his father <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers equally. </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Ashi </span>to claim a double portion of the rest of the estate. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Since you relinquished </span>your additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to some </span>of the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> relinquished </span>your additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property, </span>as a firstborn has a right to his additional portion before the division.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: So-and-so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my firstborn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will not take a double </span>portion of my estate; or one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my son, will not inherit </span>my estate <span class="gemarra-regular">among his brothers, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as he has stipulated counter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to that which is written in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">who apportions his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> orally, </span>granting it to his sons as a gift, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">increased </span>the portion given <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>of his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">and reduced </span>the portion given <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>son, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equated </span>the portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn to </span>the portions of the other sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands. But if he said</span> that they will receive the property not as a gift but <span class="gemarra-regular">as inheritance, he has said nothing. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>in his will, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether at the beginning, or in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the middle, or at the end, </span>that he is granting them the property <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, his statement stands.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that the mishna is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, doesn’t he say </span>elsewhere that if one stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to monetary matters, his stipulation stands?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 3:7): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the condition that you have no </span>ability to claim <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me food, clothing, and conjugal rights</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she is betrothed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and his stipulation is void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: With regard to monetary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as food and clothing, <span class="gemarra-regular">his stipulation stands, </span>despite being counter to that which is written in the Torah. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, one should be able to stipulate that his firstborn son not receive a double portion, or that one of his sons not inherit from him at all, as inheritance is a monetary matter.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>of his stipulation <span class="gemarra-regular">and waived </span>her rights. Therefore, the stipulation stands. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the son whose portion was reduced <span class="gemarra-regular">did not waiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> his portion. Therefore the stipulation is not valid.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that if a man <span class="gemarra-regular">says: So-and-so is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my firstborn son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the son <span class="gemarra-regular">takes a double </span>portion of his inheritance based on this testimony. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so is a firstborn, </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take a double </span>portion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the man <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the son is his <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s firstborn </span>but not his own firstborn.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rabba bar bar Ḥana </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: I know that this </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">is a firstborn. </span>Rabba bar bar Ḥana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: From where do you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know? </span>He answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because his father would call him a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> foolish firstborn. </span>Rabba bar bar Ḥana replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he is</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s firstborn, as any firstborn of a mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also called a foolish firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥanina </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I know that this</span> man <span class="gemarra-regular">is a firstborn. </span>Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do you know? He said to </span>Rabbi Ḥanina: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because when </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">would come before his father </span>to obtain a cure for their ailing eyes, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would say to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Go to my son Shikhḥat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a firstborn and his saliva heals </span>this ailment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps he is </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">mother’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborn? </span>The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is learned </span>as a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">the saliva of a father’s firstborn heals </span>this ailment but <span class="gemarra-regular">the saliva of a mother’s firstborn does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not heal </span>this ailment.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sexual organs are indeterminate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>skin <span class="gemarra-regular">became </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perforate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> so that his genitals were exposed <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a male, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double </span>portion of his father’s estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And if the firstborn son was [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] hers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was hated” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that he is not considered a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is</span> recognized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a son, </span>i.e., male, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">moment of </span>his coming into <span class="gemarra-regular">being [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">havaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., his birth.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: </span>A <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> who was found to be male <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not judged as a stubborn and rebellious son, as the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “If there will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ihyeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a stubborn and rebellious son” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:18), which is interpreted to mean that one is not judged in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is </span>recognized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a son from the moment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>his coming into <span class="gemarra-regular">being. </span>

Daf 127a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar says: </span>A <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> who was found to be male <span class="gemarra-regular">also does not reduce the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> His portion is not taken into account in the calculation of the firstborn’s additional portion. For example, if there are three brothers: A firstborn, an ordinary brother, and a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the firstborn receives one-third of the property as his additional portion, as he would if he and the ordinary brother were the only heirs, and the remaining two-thirds are divided among all three brothers. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is stated </span>with regard to the portion of the firstborn: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they have borne</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him sons” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that the brother of a firstborn does not affect his additional portion <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is </span>recognized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a son at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the moment of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">birth.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizevi says: </span>A <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> who was found to be male <span class="gemarra-regular">is also not circumcised on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eighth </span>day, if his eighth day occurs on Shabbat, although the mitzva of circumcision on the eighth day generally overrides Shabbat prohibtions. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and gives birth to a male </span>then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. <span class="gemarra-regular">And on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eighth day </span>the flesh of his foreskin <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be circumcised</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 12:2–3), which is interpreted to mean that he is not circumcised on the eighth day, in the event that it occurs on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is </span>recognized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a male from the moment of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">birth.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sherevya says: His mother is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>due to his <span class="gemarra-regular">birth, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days,” </span>which is interpreted to mean that she is not rendered impure <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is </span>recognized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a male from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the moment of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">birth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 28a): A woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who miscarries a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a hermaphrodite [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’androginos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">observes </span>the strictures of a woman who gave birth <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a male and to a female</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since it is uncertain whether the fetus is male or female, the woman must observe the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity according to both possibilities. This appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sherevya </span>that a woman who gives birth to a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> is not rendered impure at all. The Gemara affirms: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheizevi </span>with regard to circumcision, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of circumsicion is stated together with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of ritual impurity?
The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Nidda</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is uncertain </span>whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore he rules <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently, </span>that she should observe the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity for both possibilities. Rav Sheizevi’s ruling can follow the same logic: The infant should not be circumcised on Shabbat, as it is uncertain whether the mitzva of his circumcision overrides the prohibitions of Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Nidda</span> is uncertain whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated that the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">observes </span>the strictures of a woman who gave birth <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a male and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a female, and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">as a menstruating woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If it is uncertain whether the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual purity after birth pertain to a woman who gives birth to a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> at all, she should observe the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity for any blood that emerges in the time period following the birth, as it should have the status of the blood of a menstruating woman. The Gemara concludes: This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ami </span>that a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> firstborn does not receive a double portion of the inheritance. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: From the phrase “the firstborn son” (Deuteronomy 21:15) it is derived that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>receives a double portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and only a definite <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>receives a double portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one about whom it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>if he is a firstborn.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>receives a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">but a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>is understandable, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ami, but what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that only a definite <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>receives a double portion <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>one about whom it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>if he is a firstborn serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? </span>Why would one about whom it is uncertain if he is a firstborn receive a double portion?
The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava taught, as Rava taught </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">two wives </span>of the same husband <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to two males in hiding, </span>so that it is unknown which son was born first, and the husband subsequently had other sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>of the two possible firstborns <span class="gemarra-regular">writes an authorizatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the other. </span>Since their brothers can claim against each of them individually that he is not the firstborn and does not deserve a double portion, each writes the other an authorization to collect his portion, so that they can jointly claim the additional portion in any event.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava: But didn’t Ravin send </span>a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I asked all my teachers </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter and they did not tell me anything; but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">they said in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yannai: </span>If the two sons <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized, </span>i.e., it was known which one of them was the firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">were ultimately mixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and now the firstborn cannot be identified, <span class="gemarra-regular">each writes an authorization to the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">they were not </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized, each does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write an authorization to the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amora</span> to repeat his lesson to the masses aloud <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught: The statements that I said to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are a mistake on my </span>part. <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">they said in the name of Rabbi Yannai: </span>If the two sons <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized and were ultimately mixed, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each writes an authorization to the other. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized, each does not write an authorization to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents of Akra De’Agma sent </span>the following inquiry <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shmuel: Teach us, our master: </span>If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">had a presumption concerning this </span>son, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his father says concerning another </span>son of his: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

Daf 127b

<span class="gemarra-regular">each to the other.</span>
The Gemara questions this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way you </span>look at it, Shmuel’s opinion is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he holds in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>with regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have sent them </span>a response <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he holds in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, he should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sent them </span>a response <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>Shmuel’s response is not in accordance with either tannaitic opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is uncertain whether </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda or in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>Therefore he sent them a response that incorporates both opinions.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Expounding the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall acknowledge </span>the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Sages said: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall acknowledge him to others. </span>In other words, a father is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn.
<span class="gemarra-regular">From here, Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a man is deemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> credible to say: This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">my firstborn son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if he has sons presumed to be older. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">just as a man is deemed credible to say: This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">my firstborn son, so too, a man </span>who is a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed credible to say </span>about his son: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a son of a divorced woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a son of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who has performed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which cases he is disqualified from the priesthood due to his flawed lineage [<span class="it-text">ḥalal</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: He is not deemed credible.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Granted, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “He shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acknowledge;” </span>he derives from these words that a father is deemed credible to attest to the identity of his sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis, why do I </span>need the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“he shall acknowledge”?</span>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he requires identification, </span>i.e., when there is no presumption as to the identity of the firstborn. In such a situation the verse teaches that the father is deemed credible. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion only in a case where another son is presumed to be the firstborn.
The Gemara asks: According to the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is it necessary for the verse to teach that a father’s identification of his firstborn is deemed credible? If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to giving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him a double </span>portion, it is superfluous. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">be only </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person, i.e., one who is not an heir; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to give him</span> a double portion of his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he not give </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him? </span>Since the father can give a double portion to the firstborn without having to testify that he is his firstborn, it cannot be that the verse is teaching us that he is deemed credible with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a firstborn receives a double portion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary with regard to property that came into </span>the father’s possession <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward, </span>after he testified that his son is his firstborn. He could not have given him this property as a gift, as at the time of his testimony, the property did not yet belong to him, and one cannot transfer ownership of an item that one does not own. Therefore, it is necessary for the verse to teach that the father’s testimony is deemed credible so that the son can receive a double portion of the father’s future property as well.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can transfer an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the world, </span>which would mean that one can give away his property even before it enters his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>need the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“he shall acknowledge”?</span>
The Gemara answers: The term is necessary for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where property came into </span>the father’s possession <span class="gemarra-regular">when he was moribund</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at which point he cannot transfer ownership of any of his property to others. It is with regard to such property that the verse states: “He shall acknowledge,” to teach that the son who the father states is the firstborn will receive a double portion even of that property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 7:3): If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">had a presumption concerning </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is a firstborn, and his father said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerning another </span>son of his <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, </span>the father’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">had a presumption concerning </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn, and his father said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, </span>the father’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible.</span>
The Gemara asserts that as the two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> seem to contradict each other, it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>represents the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and the latter clause </span>represents the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span> about another: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is my son, and then says: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is my slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> credible. </span>It cannot disqualify him from marrying a Jewish woman or exclude him from his inheritance. Conversely, if he first says: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is my slave, and then says: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is my son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in his first statement he presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">serves me as a slave </span>does.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">at the tax house: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is passing the customs house and says </span>about a certain person: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is my son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and then </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He is my slave, </span>his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span>as he presumably says that the other is his son only to evade paying a tax for possessing a slave. Conversely, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says </span>at the customs house: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is my slave, and then </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my son, </span>his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible, </span>as one would not unnecessarily render himself liable to pay a tax.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was serving </span>another person <span class="gemarra-regular">like a son </span>serves his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the person being served <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He is my son, and then said: He is my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slave, </span>his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible. </span>Additionally, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">was serving </span>another person <span class="gemarra-regular">like a slave </span>serves his master, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the one being served <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is my slave, and then said: He is my son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>his latter statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible. </span>This contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that if he first says that he is his slave and then says that he is his son, his latter statement is deemed credible.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There, </span>in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is a case where he is presumed to be a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>everyone <span class="gemarra-regular">calls him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A slave </span>on whose <span class="gemarra-regular">border [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since everyone is referring to him in this manner, the person he served cannot call into question his status as a slave by saying that he is his son. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does it mean that on his <span class="gemarra-regular">border</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are adjacent to [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">slave. </span>In other words, he is worth one hundred dinars.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba sent </span>several rulings from Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> including the following: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says to another: You stole my slave, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not steal </span>him, and when the first inquires: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the nature of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>presence <span class="gemarra-regular">in your </span>possession, the latter responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">You sold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him to me, </span>

Daf 128a

or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You gave him to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me as a gift, </span>if he then adds: Although I owe you nothing, as the slave is mine, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">your desire, take an oath </span>that he is yours <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>him; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that the slave is his, the one in possession of the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot retract </span>his offer, although he was not obligated to make the offer.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? We</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 24a) that if one of the litigants <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other: My <span class="gemarra-regular">father is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trusted </span>to adjudicate <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your father is trusted</span> to adjudicate <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>or: These <span class="gemarra-regular">three cattle herder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who are not experts in <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are trusted </span>to adjudicate <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>and all of the individuals this litigant mentioned are legally disqualified from serving as judges, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that the one who stated this <span class="gemarra-regular">can retract </span>his statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot retract </span>it, and he is obligated to have them serve as judges if the other litigant so desires. Since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is already stated in the mishna, what novel <span class="it-text">halakha</span> did Rabbi Abba teach?
The Gemara in tractate <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> records a dispute between <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> as to the circumstances of the case of that mishna, with one <span class="it-text">amora</span> holding that the dispute pertains only to a case where the one accepting the disqualified judge will need to forgive a debt if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent, while another <span class="it-text">amora</span> holds that the dispute pertains even to a case where he will need to pay the other litigant if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent. By stating his ruling in a case where the litigant will have to give the slave to the other, Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this, that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the litigant said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will give yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> what you claim if that is the ruling of these judges, and the Rabbis hold that if he subsequently wishes to retract his suggestion, he cannot do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Abba also teaches that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the statement of the Rabbis.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the creditors of one who died <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves </span>the deceased left his heirs, i.e., they take the slaves, as slaves have the same status as land in this regard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not collec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the debt by taking the slaves.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama </span>that with regard to people with a common ancestor, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the testimony of members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>generation <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">secon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> generation whose closest familial connection is through that ancestor is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>For example, one can testify about his first cousin once removed, and is not disqualified as a relative. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Even </span>the testimony of members of the third generation <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>generation is valid; e.g., one can testify about his great-uncle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi deemed </span>one’s testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father valid, </span>as he considered it a case of testimony of a member of the third generation with regard to a member of the first generation, which Rava deemed valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama </span>concerning testimony: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>information that could serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony about </span>the boundary of another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">land before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he became blind, and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">became blind, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>from bearing witness in a dispute as to the boundaries of that person’s properties.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is fit </span>to bear witness, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to determine the boundaries </span>of the fields despite his blindness. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fit to identify a movable item, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloak, </span>as he cannot see it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet said: </span>He can identify <span class="gemarra-regular">even a cloak, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to determine its length </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and its width. But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fit to identify <span class="gemarra-regular">a piece of silver. And Rav Pappa said: </span>He can identify <span class="gemarra-regular">even a piece of silver, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to determine its weight.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 3:5): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>information that could serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony about </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">before he became his son-in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-law, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became his son-in-law, </span>thereby becoming a relative who is disqualified from bearing witness concerning him; or if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">able to hear </span>at the time he witnessed an incident <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deaf; </span>or if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">able to see </span>at the time he witnessed an incident <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became blind; </span>or if he was halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became insane, </span>in all these cases, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>from bearing witness.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he knew </span>information <span class="gemarra-regular">about him</span> that could serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony before he became his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-in-law, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became his son-in-law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter died, </span>so that they are no longer related; or if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">able to hear, and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">became deaf, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">again became able to hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>or if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">able to see, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blind, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">again became able to see; </span>or if he was halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became insane, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">again became </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent, </span>in all these cases, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to bear witness.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">principle: Anyone whose initial </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">or his ultimate </span>state, i.e., his state at the time of the incident or at the time of his testimony in court, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for bearing witness is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>from bearing witness. But any-one <span class="gemarra-regular">whose initial </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">and his ultimate </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">fitness </span>to bear witness is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to bear witness, even if he was disqualified in the interim. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> clearly states that one who is blind is disqualified from bearing witness. 

Daf 128b

The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refutation </span>of the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">of all </span>the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> who held that a person who became blind after witnessing a matter can, in certain cases, testify about it, is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba sent </span>another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama: One who says </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">child among </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sons </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not deemed credible.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: One who says concerning </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">child among </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sons: He shall inherit all my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span>who holds that one can bequeath all his property to one of his heirs (130a). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not deemed credible, in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava objects to this </span>explanation: According to Abaye’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>wording: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, and: He is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not deemed credible, </span>is not precise; <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have </span>employed the terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall inherit, and: Shall not inherit, </span>as the issue is the ability of the father to specify who will inherit from him, not his credibility.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says about </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">child among </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sons </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>(127b); <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not deemed credible, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba sent </span>another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: My wife </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will take </span>a portion of my estate <span class="gemarra-regular">like one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she takes </span>a portion <span class="gemarra-regular">like one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sons, </span>as it is considered a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this ruling is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">current property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which he can give her as a gift. The husband cannot give her a portion of his future property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, the calculation of her portion must take into account not only the number of sons the husband has at the time of his statement, but also <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons who come, </span>i.e., who will be born, <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba sent </span>another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who produces a promissory note against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the creditor says: I was not repaid anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the debtor says: I repaid hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify that </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid the entire </span>debt, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath </span>that he repaid half, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to one who admits to a part of a claim, and he is exempt from paying that half. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from unsold property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liened </span>property that was sold after the loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the buyers can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: We rely on the witnesses </span>that the debt was repaid in its entirety.
The Gemara compares this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to the case of a promissory note that states that the debtor owes the creditor: <span class="it-text">Sela</span> coins, without stating how many. The creditor claims that he lent the debtor five <span class="it-text">sela</span> and the debtor claims that he borrowed only three. Rabbi Akiva holds that since the wording of the promissory note indicates a minimum debt of two <span class="it-text">sela</span>, and the creditor could not have collected the third <span class="it-text">sela</span> without the debtor’s admission, the latter’s admission to a part of the claim cannot render him liable to take an oath. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to Rabbi Akiva, who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the debtor is not liable to take an oath, as with regard to the third <span class="it-text">sela</span> his legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>similar to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who returns a lost </span><span class="gemarra-regular">item, this statement </span>applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are no witnesses </span>to the loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">But where there are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as is the case in Rabbi Abba’s ruling, the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">fear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> denying the entire debt. Therefore he is liable to take an oath that he repaid half, as one who admits to a part of the claim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: On the contrary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; even according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, </span>who disagrees with Rabbi Akiva and <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits to a part of the claim, this statement</span> applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who support him. But </span>here in the case of Rabbi Abba, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are witnesses who support him, </span>testifying that he repaid the entire debt, his legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who returns a lost item, </span>and he does not need to take an oath that he repaid half.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Shimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ashi: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in all these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba sent to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama. Ravina said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Ashi: What </span>about the statement with <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman </span>disagreed, i.e., that a debt can be collected by taking the slaves the debtor left his heirs? Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with this ruling of Rabbi Abba as well, despite the principle that in monetary matters the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rav Naḥman’s opinion? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We teach </span>a different tradition, that Rabbi Abba’s statement rules that a creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt from the slaves the debtor left his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said the same.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>Mar Zutra <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>in ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Abba’s statement? 

Daf 129a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>his statement is said <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>that the testimony of members of the third generation concerning members of the first generation is valid, this is difficult, as Rava’s statement is not in conflict with Rabbi Abba’s statement that the testimony of members of the third generation with regard to members of the second generation is valid; <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is said to exclude the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Rav Ashi </span>that a grandfather can testify concerning his grandchild, this is also difficult, as it has already been established that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi. If </span>it is said <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the rulings <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel and Rav Sheshet and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa, </span>that a person who became blind can testify about what he saw beforehand, this too is difficult, as their rulings <span class="gemarra-regular">were refuted </span>based on a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Mar Zutra’s statement is said <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>that one cannot testify that a specific one of his sons is his firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to exclude <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strong objection of Mar bar Rav Ashi </span>to the statement of Rabbi Abba with regard to a case where a debtor admitted to part of a claim and witnesses testified that he repaid the entire debt. Despite Mar bar Rav Ashi’s objection, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the debtor is not liable to take an oath.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">who apportions his property orally, </span>granting it to his sons as a gift, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">increased </span>the portion given <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>of his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">and reduced </span>the portion given <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>other son, or equated the portion of the firstborn to the portions of the other sons, his statement stands. But if he said that they will receive the property not as a gift but as an inheritance, he has said nothing. If he wrote in his will, whether at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end, that he is granting them the property as a gift, his statement stands. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the circumstances </span>where it is phrased as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning? What are the circumstances </span>where it is phrased as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle? What are the circumstances </span>where it is phrased as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that where one on his deathbed instructed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Such and such </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a field will be given to so-and-so and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he will inherit it, this is </span>a case where it is phrased as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift at the beginning. </span>Where he instructed: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he will inherit it and it will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">given to him, this is </span>a case where it is phrased as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift at the end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Where he instructed: <span class="gemarra-regular">He will inherit it and it will be given </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him and he will inherit it, this is </span>a case where it is phrased as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that his statement is valid pertains <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to a case where the two terms, giving and inheritance, are employed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one person and one field. But </span>if they are employed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one person and two fields, </span>e.g., if he says: Reuven will inherit this field and will be given that field, or <span class="gemarra-regular">one field and two people, </span>e.g., Reuven will inherit half of this field and Shimon will be given the other half, the part that was phrased as inheritance does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>take effect. Only the part that is phrased as a gift takes effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Even </span>in a case where the two terms are employed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one person and two fields, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one field </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and two people, </span>his instruction takes effect, as both terms were employed with regard to the same person or the same field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to two fields and two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>take effect, as the two instructions are not connected to one another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that if one on his deathbed said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Such and such a field will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be given to so-and-so, and so-and-so, </span>i.e., another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">will inherit such and such a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field, </span>i.e., another field, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that even the latter person, who was designated to inherit his field, has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>He has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired</span> it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Ravin: You have lightened our </span>burden with <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>statement that you cited, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you have made it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult for us </span>with the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one. Granted, </span>the contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar </span>that you cited and the previously cited statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. There, </span>in the previously cited statement, Rabbi Elazar said that the directive takes effect <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one person and two fields, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>he said that the directive does not take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two people and two fields.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan </span>and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as Rav Dimi cited in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s name that his directive takes effect only in a case of one person and one field, and according to your citation in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan it takes effect even in a case of two people and two fields.
Ravin answered him: Rav Dimi and I <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amora’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>we each have a different tradition <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
Ravin continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says </span>that one has <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired </span>the field in the case of two people and two fields <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">says: So-and-so and so-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so will inherit such and such a field and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">such and such </span>a field <span class="gemarra-regular">that I have given them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they will inherit it.</span>
This dispute between the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> of Eretz Yisrael is also the subject <span class="gemarra-regular">of a disput</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> between the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> of Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna says: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> that when both giving and inheritance are mentioned one can increase the portion of one of his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one person and one field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one person and two fields, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one field and two people, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman says: Even </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two fields, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one field and two people, </span>it is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two fields and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two people, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not. And Rav Sheshet says: Even</span> in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two fields and two people, </span>it is effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do I say this? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 6:10): If a person on his deathbed, or <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>is going overseas, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to his children’s steward: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give a shekel to my children </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">wee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> for their needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is a situation where, based on their needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are fit </span>for the steward <span class="gemarra-regular">to give them a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., double the amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives them a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>When the father mentioned a shekel, he presumably meant that the children should be given a sum in accordance with their actual requirements, not that specific amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said: Give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them only a shekel, </span>the steward <span class="gemarra-regular">gives them only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a shekel, </span>and no more. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said: If</span> my children <span class="gemarra-regular">die, </span>

Daf 129b

<span class="gemarra-regular">others will inherit </span>their portion <span class="gemarra-regular">in their stead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he said: Give them </span>a shekel, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he said: Do not give </span>them more than a shekel, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>his children <span class="gemarra-regular">only a shekel </span>per week, so as not to reduce the share of the others, as their father clearly stated that he wishes to give his children only a specific stipend, and that he intends to leave the bulk of his property to others.
Rav Sheshet concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And isn’t </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">here like </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two fields and two people, </span>as the father gave part of his property to his sons as a gift, and the rest to others as an inheritance? <span class="gemarra-regular">But it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught that </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the property, although he employed only the terminology of inheritance concerning them.
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection and he resolved it: </span>The term others is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>those who are <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to inherit</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">him; and </span>the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span>who holds that one can bequeath his property to anyone who is fit to inherit from him. Therefore it is unnecessary for the bequest to be phrased as a gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:4): If one states: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>will go <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>after my death for your use during your lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">and after you </span>die, <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and after </span>the one who inherits <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you </span>dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so will inherit </span>the property, then in this case, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second acquires </span>it, and when <span class="gemarra-regular">the second dies, the third </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the second dies during the lifetime </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the first, the property returns </span>after his death <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the heirs of the first, </span>and does not go to the third designated recipient, as his right was to inherit it from the second one, who never received it.
Rav Ashi states his proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And here it is </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two people, </span>as the bequest to the first recipient was phrased as a gift, and to the second one it was phrased as inheritance; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the second recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the property after the death of the first.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the recipient is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to inherit</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, if so, </span>why does it state that when <span class="gemarra-regular">the second dies, the third acquires </span>it?
Rav Ashi explains his previous comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, send </span>the following ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? </span>If a person on his deathbed said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, and after you to so-and-so, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the second gets nothing in place of the first, </span>i.e., he does not receive the property after the first one dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as this formulation </span>employed by the owner was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rather, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">formulation of inheritance, and inheritance has no end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it cannot be stopped. Therefore, since the first recipient acquired it as inheritance, his heirs inherit it from him, and it cannot be taken by the second one. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is irreconcilable with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refutation of </span>the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">of all </span>the Sages who disagree with the opinion of Rav Sheshet that even if one uses the two terms with regard to two fields and two people his gift to both people is effective, is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who maintains that giving must be mentioned with regard to both recipients and both fields. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rava say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lakis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to these three </span>issues: Acquisition of land for the rights to its produce, <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span> of a pregnant woman, and the matter of bequeathal phrased both as a gift and as inheritance?
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the case where giving can be mentioned concerning one of the recipients and inheritance with regard to the other, it is a case where the two bequests were stated <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">required for speakin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a short phrase, i.e., the time it takes to greet one’s teacher. According to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, within this time a speaker can retract his statement. Therefore both bequests are considered to be part of one statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case where Reish Lakish maintains that giving must be mentioned with regard to both people for it to take effect, it is a case where the final part of the statement, where he said: And they will inherit it, was <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>statement interrupted or retracted <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">required for speakin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in all cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from idol worship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as one who accepts an idol as his god is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment even if he retracts his statement within the time required for speaking a short phrase, 

Daf 130a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and betrothal, </span>as if a man betroths a woman and retracts the betrothal within the time required for speaking, his retraction is not effective.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: So-and-so will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case where there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a daughter, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My daughter will inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">me, in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a case where there is a son, he has said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing, as he has stipulated counter to that which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written in the Torah </span>concerning the order of inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If he said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">about one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands, but</span> if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">about one for whom </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, his statement does not stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> rules that his bequeathal is invalid is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he bequeathed his estate to <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, or </span>to his <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a son, but </span>if he bequeathed his entire estate to one <span class="gemarra-regular">son among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, or </span>to one <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters, his statement stands. </span>The Gemara questions this inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">about one fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, his statement stands.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>What information does this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka add? With regard to what case do they disagree?
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is saying </span>that one’s statement stands <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where he bequeathed his estate to <span class="gemarra-regular">another where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a son, </span>as although he bequeathed it to one who is not currently his heir, the beneficiary would be fit to inherit from him if the current heirs die, and this would be contrary to the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, this is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 7:18) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father and the Rabbis did not disagree about </span>a case where one bequeathed his estate to <span class="gemarra-regular">another where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter where </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son; </span>in a case such as this, my father concedes <span class="gemarra-regular">that he has said nothing.</span>
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>a case where he bequeathed his entire estate to one <span class="gemarra-regular">son among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, or </span>to one <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters, as my father says </span>that the son or daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits </span>the entire estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not inherit </span>it.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not disagree </span>about a case where one bequeathed his estate to another where he had a daughter or to a daughter where he had a son, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, to whom he was responding, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>in this case.
And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead that the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>stating the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: So-and-so will inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a daughter, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My daughter will inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is a son, he has said nothing, but </span>if he bequeathed his property to one <span class="gemarra-regular">son among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, or </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter among </span>his other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he said </span>that the son or daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">will inherit all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his property, his statement stands, as Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>ben Beroka <span class="gemarra-regular">says: If he said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">about one fit to inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>that he should inherit all of his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands.</span>
§ As for the halakhic ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says as well </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beroka? The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day that he causes his sons to inherit” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:16), which is interpreted to mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah gave the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father permission to bequeath </span>his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to whomever he wishes</span> among his sons.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>the continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He may not make </span>the son of the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn”? From the prohibition against depriving the firstborn of his double portion it can be inferred that one can change the apportionment of the inheritance of his other sons.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>clause in the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: </span>

Daf 130b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse state: “He may not make </span>the son of the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:16)?
Abba Ḥanan explains: It is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>previously in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then it shall be, in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day that he causes his sons to inherit,” as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought: <span class="gemarra-regular">Could this not </span>be derived through an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>son, one who is not a firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> power is enhanced </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he takes </span>in inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed </span>at the time he died, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave the father permission to bequeath </span>his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to whichever</span> of his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">he wishes, </span>depriving his other sons of their portions, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn, whose power</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is diminished </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not take </span>a double portion of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>his father <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he takes of the property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed </span>at the time of his death, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so</span> that his father can deprive him of the double portion he receives as a firstborn? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not make </span>the son of the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.”</span>
Abba Ḥanan continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>only the prohibition of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He may not make </span>the son of the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn.” Why </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse state: “Then it shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be, in the day that he causes his sons to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherit”?</span>
It is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought: <span class="gemarra-regular">Could this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>be derived through an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn, whose power </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is diminished </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not take </span>a double portion of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>his father <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he takes of the property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed, </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “He may not make </span>the son of the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborn,” </span>i.e., the firstborn may not be deprived of his double portion, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>son, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose power is enhanced </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he takes </span>in inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more so </span>that his father cannot deprive him of his portion of the inheritance?
Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he causes his sons to inherit,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave the father permission to bequeath </span>his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to whichever</span> of his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">he wishes. </span>Consequently, the prohibition “he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn” is not available to prove that one may bequeath his estate to whichever of his sons he wishes.
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of the halakhic ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Abba said to </span>Rabbi Zerika: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>in an actual case in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>Since both Rabbi Zerika and Rabbi Abba agree that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, why did Rabbi Abba state that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi ruled as much in an actual case? The Gemara answers: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Zerika, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a ruling in principle is <span class="gemarra-regular">a preferable </span>source for <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>rather than a ruling from an incident; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Abba, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that a specific <span class="gemarra-regular">incident </span>ruled upon by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage </span>is a preferable source.
The Gemara examines which source is preferable. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may derive </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neither from a statemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an inciden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> where one saw a ruling issued in a certain manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the Sages explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">tell him </span>that it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">practical </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and they told him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">practical </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go and act </span>upon the ruling in those circumstances, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not compare </span>between cases and apply the ruling to other circumstances.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that he does not compare? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t we compare </span>cases throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah? </span>The main method of halakhic derivation is through comparing cases where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was already established to cases where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is unclear.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Provided that he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not compare between </span>various cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals with wounds that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will cause them to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which are forbidden for consumption. In general, one may compare cases, but with regard to the definition of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, one may not compare.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one does not say: This </span>wound <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to that </span>wound. Every type of wound has its own <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not wonder </span>about this principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there are </span>organs with regard to which one <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it from here, </span>i.e., one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">dies </span>within twelve months, but one <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts it from there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., another side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it lives.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: When the Master, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to us: This is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, should we act </span>upon the ruling? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Do not act </span>upon the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">unless I say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a practical </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Pappa and to Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua: When a legal ruling of mine comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before you and you perceive a refutation of it, do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not tear it up until you come before me </span>to discuss it. <span class="gemarra-regular">If I have </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">explanation, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will tell you, and if not, I will retract </span>my ruling. If a ruling of mine comes before you <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>when you can no longer discuss it with me, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not tear it up, but do not learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from it either, </span>i.e., do not rule in accordance with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not tear it up, as had I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been there, perhaps I would have told you </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">explanation </span>that you would have accepted; 

Daf 131a

but <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not learn from it either, as a judge has only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what his eyes se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as the basis for his ruling. One must rule according to his own understanding.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who bequeaths his estate to one of his sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>should the court rule? Should it be reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says </span>that the bequeathal is valid, he said so specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed, since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is capable of bequeathal, </span>as the verse: “In the day that he causes his sons to inherit” (Deuteronomy 21:16), from which the validity of this bequeathal is derived, is referring specifically to the time of one’s death; <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person, </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> say his ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>he stated his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of your dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Natan said to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">You taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">your Mishna in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 52b): If the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>in her marriage contract: Any <span class="gemarra-regular">male childre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have from me will inherit the money of your marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contract in addition to their portion </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> they receive together <span class="gemarra-regular">with their brothers, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated</span> as though he had written it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stipulation of the cour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and consequently takes effect even if it is not explicitly stated. This mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka that one may add to the share of some of his sons at the expense of the others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>We did not learn that the male children she has from him will inherit the money of the marriage contract; that version is not accurate. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will take </span>the money of the marriage contract, as a gift. When a bequeathal is worded in this manner, it is valid in any event, as stated in the previous mishna (126b).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi later retracted his response, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>My response was because of <span class="gemarra-regular">immaturity </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in me, and I was insolent in the presence of </span>Rabbi <span class="gemarra-regular">Natan the Babylonian </span>by responding in a manner that is incorrect. It is incorrect for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since we maintain </span>that concerning an obligation detailed in a marriage document ensuring inheritance rights of a woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">male</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children, </span>the beneficiaries <span class="gemarra-regular">do not repossess liened </span>property that has been sold, one can infer that they do not receive the money as a gift. As, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it enters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will take </span>the money as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">why don’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they repossess liened </span>property? The gift was given to them before the property was sold to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from</span> this claim that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will inherit </span>the money.
Rav Mesharshiyya concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Of whom have you heard that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he holds this opinion </span>that one can add to the inheritance of some of his sons at the expense of the others? It is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beroka, and conclude from </span>the mishna in <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> that his ruling applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to a healthy person, </span>as one does not write a marriage contract on his deathbed. This resolves Rava’s dilemma.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> How can one prove that the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? <span class="gemarra-regular">Whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to the one who says </span>that the correct version of the mishna is: <span class="gemarra-regular">They will take, and whether according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>the correct version of the mishna is: <span class="gemarra-regular">They will inherit, </span>the mishna is difficult, for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person cannot transfer ownership </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How can the husband confer rights to his property to children that have yet to be born?
Rav Pappa explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person can transfer ownership </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world, this statement </span>applies specifically in a case where he transfers the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to an entity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is in the world; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to transferring ownership of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that is not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">in the world, </span>e.g., to his children that have yet to be born, this statement does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply. Therefore, the ruling of the mishna is difficult according to all opinions.
Rav Pappa explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>evidently <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court is different. </span>Since this clause of the marriage contract was instituted by rabbinic ordinance, it is not subject to the standard <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of transferring property, and one can transfer ownership of an item to an entity that is not yet in the world. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>with regard to the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different, </span>and even according to the Rabbis, who disagree with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, one can bequeath the money of his wife’s marriage contract to the male children she will have from him in any manner he chooses. Consequently, there is no proof that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The assertion that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it expresses </span>this bequeathal <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wording: They will inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as opposed to: They will take. This indicates that a person can normally apportion his inheritance to his sons in any manner he wishes, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye then said: That which I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said is not correct. </span>The expression: They will inherit, is appropriate even according to the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the continuation of that mishna that even if the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his wife: Any <span class="gemarra-regular">female childre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you will have from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me will sit in my house and be sustained from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my property until they are taken by men, </span>i.e., until they are married, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>as though he had written it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stipulation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the court.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since these two clauses are written adjacent to each other in the marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>effectively a case where one bequeaths his estate to two people: <span class="gemarra-regular">To this </span>one, the daughters, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>one, the sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">as an inheritance. And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case where one bequeaths his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">as an inheritance and to that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even the Rabbis concede </span>that the bequest is valid even if it is to people who are not his heirs, as it is considered a gift with regard to both recipients.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥumi, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya bar Minyumi, said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Abaye: </span>

Daf 131b

<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>both clauses, the one for the benefit of the sons and the one for the benefit of the daughters, <span class="gemarra-regular">were instituted by one court </span>and are therefore each read in light of the other? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps they were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> instituted by two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">courts </span>and are unrelated to each other. Accordingly, the wording of the gift and the wording of the inheritance are not part of the same statement.
The Gemara answers: This possibility should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">former clause </span>of that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>(<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 49a): A father is not obligated to provide his daughter’s sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">This interpretation was interpreted </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages of the vineyard in Yavne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Since the Sages instituted that after the father’s death, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>the sum of money specified in their mother’s marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the daughters are sustained </span>from their father’s estate, these two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are equated: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons inherit only after their father’s death, </span>not during his lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the daughters are sustained </span>from their father’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">only after their father’s death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the two clauses <span class="gemarra-regular">were instituted by one court, this is</span> the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that we derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of one <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance, </span>under the assumption that a court institutes ordinances in a consistent manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">were instituted by two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">courts </span>operating in different periods, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can we derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of one <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance?</span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it assumed that they were instituted by one court? <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, I will say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the two clauses <span class="gemarra-regular">were instituted by two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">courts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>nevertheless Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya derived the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of one ordinance from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the other ordinance, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter court </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>its ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the format of <span class="gemarra-regular">the former court, so that </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not ask </span>about contradictions between one <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance. </span>With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of inheritance, there is no reason to read the two clauses in light of the other.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>A person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">who writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all his property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has merely rendered her a steward. </span>The assumption is that he did not intend to deprive his heirs of their entire inheritance. Rather, he intended to appoint her as a steward in charge of the property, so that the heirs will honor her.
The Gemara discusses similar cases: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one writes a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adult son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he does not intend to give him the entire inheritance, but to have him distribute it among his brothers. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has merely rendered him a steward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apotropos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he writes it to <span class="gemarra-regular">his minor son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it still assumed that his intention is to appoint him as a steward, or is that implausible since a minor boy is not yet capable of assuming this position and therefore the father apparently intended to bequeath to him the entire inheritance?
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanilai bar Idi </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one wrote a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his minor son who is lying in</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">crib, </span>he does not receive the entire inheritance. Rather, the father presumably intended to appoint him as a steward when he reached adulthood, so that the other heirs would honor him.
The Gemara states: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> person, he intended to give <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>person half the property <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, and </span>to appoint <span class="gemarra-regular">his son a steward </span>to oversee the property of his brothers, with whom he shares the other half. Similarly, if he wrote a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wife and anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> person, he intended to give <span class="gemarra-regular">the other</span> person half the property <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, and </span>to appoint <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife a steward </span>to oversee the other half of the property for his sons.
Furthermore, it is obvious that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his betrothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife, </span>whom he did not yet wed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>former <span class="gemarra-regular">wife, </span>whom he had <span class="gemarra-regular">divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he intended to give it to them <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a gift, </span>as he had no reason to have his heirs honor them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: If one wrote a document granting all his property to his <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter before </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in a case where he has sons who would inherit from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife before </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or</span> to his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife before the husband’s sons </span>who are not her sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it assumed that his intention was to appoint her as a steward or to give her the property as a gift?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in all of </span>these cases the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>the property. Rather, he or she was merely appointed a steward, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">his betrothed wife and his </span>former <span class="gemarra-regular">wife </span>whom he <span class="gemarra-regular">divorced. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avira said in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in all of </span>these cases the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired</span> the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the cases of his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife before</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers and </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife before the husband’s sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where he clearly intended only to appoint her as a steward. 

Daf 132a

With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a person on his deathbed who wrote a document granting all his property to his wife has appointed her as a steward, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Should it be reasoned that specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on his deathbed it </span>is assumed that he intended to appoint his wife as a steward, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is preferable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for him that her word be heard </span>and she is honored after his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">healthy person, he is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>and can ensure that his wife is honored, so he apparently intended to actually give her all of his property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>should it be reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well, it is preferable that </span>his wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">word be heard </span>and she be given honor <span class="gemarra-regular">from now?</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of the dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document that <span class="gemarra-regular">the profits of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his property </span>should go <span class="gemarra-regular">to his wife </span>in the event that he dies or divorces her, <span class="gemarra-regular">she collects </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract, </span>which he wrote her at the time of their marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the land </span>itself. The profits are hers as a result of his gift. Similarly, if he wrote a document granting her <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half, one-third, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or one-quarter </span>of his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">she collects </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract from the rest </span>of his property, which he did not give her as a separate gift.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all his property to his wife, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">a promissory note emerged against him </span>for a loan he took while they were married but before he gave her this gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">tear up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her </span>deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and remain with her marriage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract, </span>so that the creditor will not be able to collect the property she received, as her marriage contract preceded the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: She </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">tear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up her marriage contrac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and remain with her </span>deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, </span>as by accepting the gift of all her husband’s property she waived her right to receive payment of her marriage contract. Since the promissory note preceded the deed of gift, the creditor receives the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bald from here and from there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., she receives neither her gift nor her marriage contract.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">occurred to my sister’s daughter </span>who is my <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">in-law [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that my son wrote such a document to her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the incident came before the Sages. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">tear up her marriage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract and remain with her </span>deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, and she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bald from here and from there.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>she loses her gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is that a promissory note emerged against him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but if a promissory note did not emerge against him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she acquires </span>the gift of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span>case is this stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a person on his deathbed, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you say </span>previously that in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">he merely rendered her a steward? Rather, is it not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a healthy person? </span>Accordingly, Rava’s dilemma is resolved: If a healthy person writes a document granting all his property to his wife, it is hers.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person on his deathbed; and Rav Avira would interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to all of </span>the cases mentioned above in which, in his opinion, the wife acquires the property and is not appointed as a steward. And <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interpret </span>it specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to </span>a case where one wrote a document granting all his property to <span class="gemarra-regular">his betrothed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife or his </span>former <span class="gemarra-regular">wife, whom he divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where he concedes that she acquires the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <span class="gemarra-regular">She </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">tear up her marriage contrac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and remain with her </span>deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, and she is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bald from here and from there.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that Rav Naḥman does not follow </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">assessing </span>intention, meaning that even if one did not state something explicitly, the court assesses what his intention was and decides the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> based on that assessment? Clearly, upon accepting the gift the wife did not intend to waive payment of her marriage contract and thereby be left with nothing in the event that her husband’s creditor produces a promissory note that predates her gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 5:9): In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son went overseas and he heard that his son died, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his property to others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and then his son came </span>back, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift </span>to the other people <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: His gift is not</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, as had he known that his son</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">alive he would not have written </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Menasya. </span>Apparently, Rav Naḥman follows the principle of assessing intention.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of one who writes a document granting all his property to his wife, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her that it be publicized that he wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">that property, </span>and she was willing to risk not receiving payment of her marriage contract to gain this benefit.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:7): If a man <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to his sons, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his wife, she has lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her any amount of land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, she has lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> marriage contract? </span>Why should this be?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>This mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">transfers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ownership </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>his wife’s participation in a formal act of acquisition. Not only did she not protest the transfer of property to the sons, but she facilitated the transaction. Clearly, she agreed to waive payment of her marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>It is referring not only to a case where she actually participates in the act of acquisition, but also <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">distributes </span>the property to his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her presence, and she is silen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and does not ask about her marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina, says: </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says to her: Take </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 132b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught here </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies </span>that apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This manner in which the wife loses her right to receive payment of her marriage contract is a leniency for the husband, as an ordinary creditor does not lose money he is owed in this fashion.
The Gemara questions this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the same mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if she accepted </span>the distribution <span class="gemarra-regular">upon herself, even if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not write </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>any amount of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">she has lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract. By inference, </span>it can be stated <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that both his <span class="gemarra-regular">writing </span>a document granting her a piece of land <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">acceptance</span> of the distribution <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary </span>for her to lose her right, contrary to the interpretation of all three <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, i.e., Rav, Shmuel, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, all of whom assumed that she need not affirmatively accept the distribution and that her silence is sufficient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who holds that either the husband’s writing a deed of gift or the wife’s acceptance of the distribution is sufficient, <span class="gemarra-regular">but isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: </span>According to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">whe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> does she lose her right to receive payment of her marriage contract? In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she was there </span>at the time of the distribution <span class="gemarra-regular">and accepted </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she was there but did not accept </span>it, or <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">but was not there, she has not lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract, </span>as she can claim that her acquiescence was only to please her husband and was not sincere. The Gemara concludes: The <span class="gemarra-regular">refutation </span>of the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">of all </span>the interpretations of the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman: This </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav; this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. What does the Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>in this matter? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I say, that once he rendered her a partne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the property <span class="gemarra-regular">among the sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract.</span>
Rav Naḥman’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also stated </span>as a halakhic ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Minyumi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">once he rendered her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partner </span>in the property <span class="gemarra-regular">among the sons, she lost</span> her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises a dilemma: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the wife loses her right to receive payment of her marriage contract only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his deathbed, as she knew that he had no </span>other property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>payment of the marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person, she </span>might have <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he will then acquire </span>other property from which she will be able to collect payment of her marriage contract, and that is why she accepted the distribution of the property? If so, she did not waive her right to receive payment of her marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>should it be reasoned that since <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event, now he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no </span>other property, her acceptance should be interpreted as waiving her right? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand</span> unresolved.
§ There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>the people surrounding him: Give <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half </span>of my estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, and one-half to </span>my other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, and one-third of the produce to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">wife. Rav Naḥma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to Sura. He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entered </span>the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>see <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred to her </span>ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">only one palm tree for its produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lost </span>her right to receive payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Say that Shmuel said </span>his statement that she loses her right <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in a case where he gave her a palm tree for its produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he transferred</span> rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in the land itself to her ownership, </span>as the palm tree is connected to the ground. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>that he gave her, without any share in the land itself. Perhaps she does not lose payment of her marriage contract. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: You say </span>that he gave her only <span class="gemarra-regular">movable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property? I certainly did not </span>mean to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that she loses her right even if he gave her only <span class="gemarra-regular">movable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> such as produce. Rather, she receives payment of her marriage contract.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>the people surrounding him: Give <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third </span>of my property <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one-third to </span>my other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, and one-third to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">wife. One of his daughters died </span>before he did, and her portion consequently returned to his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thought to say </span>that the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">takes only one-third. </span>She cannot receive payment of her marriage contract from the two-thirds bequeathed to the daughters, as by entering a partnership with the daughters in ownership of the property, she waived payment of her marriage contract. 

Daf 133a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said to him: If </span>the husband had <span class="gemarra-regular">then acquired </span>other property, <span class="gemarra-regular">would she not have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taken </span>it as payment of her marriage contract? <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he </span>would have <span class="gemarra-regular">then acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> other property <span class="gemarra-regular">she would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have taken </span>it as payment of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">now</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she also takes </span>the deceased daughter’s share as payment of her marriage contract.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">who divided his property between his wife and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, leaving </span>out a <span class="gemarra-regular">single palm tree. Ravina thought to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">has only </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">single palm tree</span> as future payment of her marriage contract, which was presumably left out of the distribution for this reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Ravina: If she does not have </span>the right to collect payment of her marriage contract from all of his property, as she presumably waived that right when he gave her the gift of some of his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">she</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>the right to collect it from the <span class="gemarra-regular">single palm tree either </span>and it belongs to the heirs. Rav Yeimar presents a different ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, since </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">descend to </span>collect the <span class="gemarra-regular">palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">descends to </span>collect <span class="gemarra-regular">all of the property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well, </span>i.e., she receives payment of her marriage contract from all the property.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all his property to another, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">investigates </span>the legal status of the recipient: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., if he is one of his sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">as an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance, and if not, he takes it as a gift.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why should you steal </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and not attribute it to its source? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you hold in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say </span>explicitly that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as your halakhic statement follows </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka </span>that a person can bequeath his property to any of his heirs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps this is what you </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There was a certain </span>childless person <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was dying, and </span>those around him <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: To </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom should his, </span>i.e., your, <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>be given? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps</span> it should be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so? And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to them: Rather, to whom </span>if not him? <span class="gemarra-regular">And you, </span>Rav Huna, meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say to us: If</span> that person <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes it as an inheritance, and if not, he takes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it as a gift. </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that is what I was saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is there a difference whether he receives it as an inheritance or as a gift? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava, </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava, thought </span>that it would be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>the giver’s <span class="gemarra-regular">widow is sustained from his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as she has the right to be sustained from the inheritance; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if not, </span>and the property was given as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">his widow is not sustained from his property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>Can the widow’s right be <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>by the gift? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you say with regard to inheritance, </span>which is granted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his widow is sustained from his property, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift </span>of a person on his deathbed, which is effective without any formal act of acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that the widow has sustenance rights?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that the difference whether it is inheritance or a gift is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avya sent: According to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Beroka, </span>in the case of one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, and after you to so-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so, and the first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, the second gets nothing in place of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>i.e., he does not receive the property after the first one dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as this formulation </span>employed by the owner was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of a gift. Rather, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a formulation of inheritance, and inheritance has no end, </span>i.e., it cannot be stopped. Therefore, since the first recipient acquired it as an inheritance, his heirs inherit it from him, and it cannot be taken by the second.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But he ended</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. </span>The one who bequeathed it to him ended his inheritance in advance by stating that after the first dies, the property will be given to the second. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He thought </span>that inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">has an end; but the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Merciful One states </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it has no end. </span>

Daf 133b

There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, and after you, to so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-and-so, and the first one was fit to inherit</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>After <span class="gemarra-regular">the first died, the second came and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> claimed </span>the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ilish, </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the presence of Rava, thought to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the second</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also take</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a share of the property; he divides it with the heirs of the first. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Judges of compromise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who as a matter of course divide disputed property between the parties, <span class="gemarra-regular">rule in this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">manner. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t this </span>identical to the case concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sent </span>a ruling that the second receives nothing?
Rav Ilish <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">embarrassed </span>by his mistake. To comfort him, Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the following verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about him: “I, the Lord, will hasten it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its time” </span>(Isaiah 60:22), as if to say: It was due to Divine Providence that I was here to correct you before your mistaken ruling was implemented.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to others </span>as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">and left his sons </span>with nothing, <span class="gemarra-regular">what he did is done, </span>i.e., it takes effect; <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Sages are displeased with him. Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel says: If </span>he did so because <span class="gemarra-regular">his sons were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not acting properly, he is remembered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">positively</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do the Rabbis disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>maintaining that depriving one’s children of their inheritance is inappropriate in any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not?</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Yosef ben Yo’ezer had a son who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was not acting properly. </span>Yosef ben Yo’ezer <span class="gemarra-regular">had a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">illiyyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> full <span class="gemarra-regular">of dinars, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he arose and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated it </span>to the Temple treasury, depriving his son of his inheritance. His son <span class="gemarra-regular">went and married the daughter of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">King Yannai’s crown weaver. </span>After the son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave birth, he bought her a fish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">binita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tore its </span>stomach open and <span class="gemarra-regular">found a pearl in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>He decided to sell it.
His wife <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Do not bring it to </span>the treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">the king </span>to sell it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they will take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it from you for an insignificant </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">money. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">go bring it to the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">treasurers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not appraise it yourself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as declaration to the Most </span><span class="gemarra-regular">High is equivalent to transfer to an ordinary </span>person, and if you offer to sell it for an amount less than its worth, you will not be able to change your mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, let them appraise it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>to the Temple treasury, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they appraised it as</span> having the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen vessels [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">illiyyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">of dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The treasurers <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There are seven </span><span class="it-text">illiyyata</span> of dinars at our disposal to pay you for the pearl, but <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">six. He said to</span> the treasurers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>in exchange for the pearl, and as for the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>that you owe me, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are hereby consecrated to Heaven.</span>
The treasurers <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and wrote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef ben Yo’ezer bestowed one </span><span class="it-text">illiyyata</span> to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his son bestowed six. And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that they wrote: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef ben Yo’ezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bestowed one </span><span class="it-text">illiyyata</span> to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removed seven, </span>which he received for the pearl.
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they said </span>approvingly that Yosef ben Yo’ezer’s son <span class="gemarra-regular">bestowed </span>seven, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, he acted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>when he left him out of his inheritance. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary; from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>according to the second account, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>disparagingly that he <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>seven, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, </span>Yosef ben Yo’ezer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not act</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well </span>when he left him out of his inheritance, as he caused money to be removed from the Temple treasury. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, no </span>inference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be learned from this </span>story with regard to the dilemma as to whether the Rabbis agree with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as the two accounts contradict each other on this matter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>halakhic conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shinnana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a house where inheritance is transferre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> away from its rightful heir, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wicked son to a good son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more so </span>if it is transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">from a son to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter. </span>Evidently, the Rabbis hold that inheritance should not be transferred in any case.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one man whose children did not act properly. He arose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wrote </span>a document transferring all <span class="gemarra-regular">his propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yonatan ben Uzziel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one of the Sages, as a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">What did Yonatan ben Uzziel do? He sold a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>of the property for his needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and consecrated a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> of the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and returned </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">third to</span> the man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">children.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came to </span>Yonatan ben Uzziel <span class="gemarra-regular">with his staff and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">traveling ba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to protest his giving part of the property to the man’s children against the deceased’s wishes. Yonatan ben Uzziel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Shammai, if you can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repossess </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the purchasers <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I consecrated </span>from the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">you can repossess what I returned </span>to the man’s children as well; 

Daf 134a

but <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, </span>as the property is mine and I have the right to do with it whatever I want, <span class="gemarra-regular">you cannot repossess what I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>to the man’s children either. Shammai then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Uzziel reprimanded me; ben Uzziel reprimanded me, </span>and I have no response.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did </span>Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">hold initially, </span>causing him to protest Yonatan ben Uzziel’s behavior? The Gemara answers: He protested <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the incident </span>that happened <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥoron.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 48a): <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving someone in </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Ḥoron whose father </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had vowed not to derive benefit from him, and </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">was marrying off his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>and wanted his father to be able to participate in the wedding meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said to another: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>where the wedding will take place <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">meal are hereby </span><span class="gemarra-regular">given to you as a gift, but they are </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you only so that my father will come and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat with us at the meal. </span>The son wanted to circumvent the prohibition imposed by the vow and enable his father to participate in the meal, so he transferred ownership to someone else for that purpose.
The recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mine, they are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">hereby consecrated to Heaven, </span>i.e., the Temple, and are forbidden to everyone. The son <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in anger: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not give you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">so that you should consecrate them to Heaven. </span>The recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You gave me your </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that you and your father would eat and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drink and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">appease each other, and the sin </span>of transgressing the vow would <span class="gemarra-regular">be hung on his, </span>i.e., my, <span class="gemarra-regular">head, </span>as I enabled the transgression.
The mishna continues: In reference to this incident, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages said: Any gift that is not</span> so absolute <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">were to consecrate it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">would be consecrated, is not a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In other words, in order for it to be a gift the recipient must have the ability to consecrate it. Similarly, Shammai had initially reasoned that the gift to Yonatan ben Uzziel was not a valid gift, as its sole purpose was so that the property should not fall into the possession of the man’s children. Once he discovered that Yonatan ben Uzziel consecrated part of the gift, he realized that it was, in fact, a valid gift, with which the recipient could do whatever he pleased.
§ Apropos Yonatan ben Uzziel, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: Hillel the Elde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had eighty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">students. Thirty of them </span>were sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">worthy that the Divine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Presence should rest upon the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>it did upon <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our teacher, thirty of them </span>were sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">worthy that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sun should stand still for them as </span>it did for <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua bin Nun, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>were on <span class="gemarra-regular">an intermediate </span>level between the other two. <span class="gemarra-regular">The greatest of all </span>the students was <span class="gemarra-regular">Yonatan ben Uzziel, and the least of them </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said about Rabban Yoḥanan ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zakkai </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not neglect Bible and Mishna; Talmud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggadot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; minutiae of the Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and minutiae</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the scribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the hermeneutical principles of the Torah with regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inferences; <span class="gemarra-regular">and verbal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">analogies; and </span>the calculation of the calendric <span class="gemarra-regular">seasons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">numerical values </span>of Hebrew letters <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimatriyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and parables of launderers, </span>which are folktales that can be used to explain the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and parables </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of foxes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In addition, he did not neglect esoteric matters, including <span class="gemarra-regular">the conversation of demons, and the conversation of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the conversation of ministering angels, and </span>more generally, <span class="gemarra-regular">a great matter and a small matter.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A great matter is </span>referring to the secrets of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Design of the </span>Divine <span class="gemarra-regular">Chariot </span>(see Ezekiel, chapter 1), the conduct of the transcendent universe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a small matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is, </span>for example, <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that were ultimately formulated in the framework of <span class="gemarra-regular">the discussions of Abaye and Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He did not neglect any of these disciplines, so as <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fulfill that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “That I may cause those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that love me to inherit substance and that I may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fill their treasuries” </span>(Proverbs 8:21), as Rabban Yoḥanan was filled with the disciplines of Torah and wisdom.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the least of them </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>prolific, <span class="gemarra-regular">the greatest of them </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>prolific. The Gemara relates that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f  Y</span><span class="gemarra-regular">onatan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Uzziel, </span>the greatest of Hillel’s students, that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he would sit and engage in Torah </span>study, the sanctity that he generated was so intense that <span class="gemarra-regular">any bird that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would fl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over him would be incinerated.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says: This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is my son, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>One who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible </span>with regard to his other brothers’ obligation to share the inheritance with the subject of his statement. When one claims that this man is his brother, this claim is accepted with regard to the speaker’s own portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>a share of their father’s inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span> he received from the father’s inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">shall return to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to the possession of the brother who testified on his behalf, from whose portion he received a share.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came into </span>the man in question’s possession <span class="gemarra-regular">from somewhere</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> else, </span>other than from the father, and the man in question died, all of <span class="gemarra-regular">the brothers of </span>the one who testified <span class="gemarra-regular">shall inherit with </span>the one who testified, as according to his claim they too are the heirs of the deceased.
gemara The mishna teaches that one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is this stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>It is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to inheriting </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>i.e., the son inherits from the speaker, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendering his wife exempt from levirate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Because he claims that the person in question is his son, his wife is not required to enter into levirate marriage after his death, as he has a child. 

Daf 134b

The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that his claim is deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">inheriting </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Since he could have given this person his property as a gift, it need not be stated that his claim is accepted with regard to his inheritance. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for </span>the mishna to state that his claim is deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to rendering his wife exempt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from levirate marriag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> despite the fact that it is not in his power to render her exempt, but the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of inheritance is not a novelty.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 64a) <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: One who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the time of his death: I have children, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span>and his wife is thereby exempt from levirate marriage. If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and his wife therefore must enter levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in that mishna, it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not presumed by us to </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">a brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, his wife is already presumed to be exempt from levirate marriage, and his claim that he has a son merely substantiates this presumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the mishna adds a novelty that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he is presumed to </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">a brother, </span>his claim that he has a son is accepted, and his wife is thereby exempted from levirate marriage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible? Sinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a husband who says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I divorced my wife, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span>and his wife is thereby exempt from levirate marriage, he is deemed credible with regard to this claim as well.
As Rav Yosef forgot some of his Torah knowledge due to an illness, he questioned the accuracy of his citation of Rav Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Master of Abraham! </span>This reasoning <span class="gemarra-regular">makes </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in the Mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">dependent upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that which is not taught, </span>as the credibility of one who claims: This is my son, is stated in the mishna, while the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a husband’s claim that he divorced his wife is accepted is the statement of an <span class="it-text">amora</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>this explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated like this: Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my son, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible </span>with regard to rendering his wife exempt from levirate marriage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is in his power to divorce her </span>and thereby render her exempt from levirate marriage, he is deemed credible with regard to this claim as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>in addition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the husband is deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>he has the power to divorce her, <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband who says: I divorced my wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is also <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, since it is in his power</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to divorce her </span>at any time.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A husband who says: I have divorced my wife, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheshet waved his hand </span>disparagingly, as if to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef’s </span>statement that he is deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>it is in his power to divorce her <span class="gemarra-regular">is gone </span>due to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan actually say that? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Avin say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: I have divorced my wife, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible?</span>
The Gemara answers: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the statement that the husband is not deemed credible, Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a retroactive </span>testimony. For example, in a case where he testified that he divorced her on a certain date, and it is discovered that she engaged in sexual intercourse with another man after that date, his testimony is not accepted concerning whether the woman is liable to receive punishment; she is not considered to have been divorced at the time. This is because it is not in the husband’s power to divorce her retroactively.
By contrast, the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the husband’s testimony is deemed credible, refers to testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">for the future, </span>e.g., where he says that he divorced her on that same day, or without specifying a date, in which case his statement is relevant only for the future. Since it was in his power to divorce her at that time, his testimony is deemed credible; if he dies, she is exempt from levirate marriage, and if she engages in sexual intercourse with another man, she is not considered to have committed adultery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was raised before </span>the Sages: If the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that he divorced his wife on a certain date, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> retroactive </span>testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>his testimony being <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible </span>and accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the future, </span>rendering her divorced from that time onward, despite the fact that his claim is not accepted with regard to the past?
The dilemma is based on the following fundamental question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divide the </span>husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">statement, </span>accepting that he divorced his wife inasmuch as she is considered divorced from that time onward, since it is in his power to divorce her now, even though his claim that he divorced her in the past is not accepted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or do we not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divide the statement, </span>and say instead that his claim is rejected altogether, since his claim concerning the past cannot be accepted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari and Rav Zevid </span>engaged in a dispute with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we divide</span> the husband’s statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not divide </span>it.
The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from Rava’s </span>statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava says </span>that if a man says: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so engaged in sexual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intercourse with my wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">combine to kill him, </span>i.e., to have him sentenced to death for adultery. The Gemara infers: He combines with another witness <span class="gemarra-regular">to kill him, but not to kill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her. </span>The wife is not sentenced to death based on this testimony, even if they testified that she engaged in sexual intercourse willingly, as a husband is disqualified from bearing witness concerning his wife. Evidently, the husband’s testimony is divided; his testimony concerning the man is accepted even though the testimony concerning his wife’s part in the same action is rejected.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">bodie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we divide</span> the statement. Therefore the husband’s testimony is accepted with regard to the man but rejected with regard to his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to one body we do not divide</span> it. That is why one Sage holds that a husband’s claim that he divorced his wife in the past cannot be divided, so that his claim that he divorced her would be accepted while his claim as to when he divorced her would be rejected. 

Daf 135a

The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man, who was presumed to have brothers but no children, <span class="gemarra-regular">who was dying. </span>His wife was therefore presumed to be obligated in levirate marriage. Those with him <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: To whom </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife, </span>i.e., your wife, be married? Is she required to enter into levirate marriage, or is she permitted to marry whomever she wishes? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: She</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is fit to </span>marry even <span class="gemarra-regular">a High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> She is not required to enter into levirate marriage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>possibility need <span class="gemarra-regular">we be concerned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to her? Doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have divorced my wife, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and she is exempt from levirate marriage? Therefore, this woman will be exempt as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divorced my wife, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: But didn’t we resolve </span>the contradiction, concluding that <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a retroactive </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">and there </span>he was referring to testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">for the future</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Therefore, according to both versions of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, the husband should be deemed credible in this case.
Abaye responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall we arise and rely on answers </span>in a halakhic ruling? Although the contradiction can be resolved in this manner, there is no guarantee that this resolution is correct. Therefore Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef’s statement should still be taken into consideration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Natan bar Ami</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Be concerned about it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> There may be a dispute with regard to this issue, as the resolution cannot be relied upon.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who was presumed by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us, </span>i.e., the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">to have no brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he said at the time of his death </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he has no brothers. Rav Yosef said: </span>With <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>possibility need <span class="gemarra-regular">we be concerned with regard to </span>his wife, in terms of her requiring levirate marriage? For <span class="gemarra-regular">one, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is presumed by us to have no brothers, and furthermore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he said at the time of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has none. Abaye said to him: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">don’t </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that there are witnesses overseas who know that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has brothers? </span>Therefore, we should be concerned that this report is accurate.
Rav Yosef responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, now </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">before us, </span>so this possibility does not need to be taken into account. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina’s </span>ruling in a case where women who were captured and subsequently liberated claimed that they were not raped in captivity (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 23a)? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>although people said there were witnesses elsewhere who could testify that they were raped, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina says </span>that they were permitted to marry a priest, reasoning: Just because there may be <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses in the north [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">istan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in a distant place, <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">be forbidden?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If we were lenient with regard to a captive woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, due to, </span>among other reasons, the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">makes herself repulsiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the captor </span>so that he will not want to rape her, and we assume that she was not raped, <span class="gemarra-regular">should we be lenient with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a married woman? Rava said to Rav Natan bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ami: Be concerned about it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Do not permit this woman to remarry until the matter is clarified.
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my brother, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible </span>with regard to his other brothers’ share of their father’s inheritance. Rather, the man in question receives a portion only from the portion of the one who testified concerning him. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do the other </span>brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">say? If they say: He is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our brother, why </span>does the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>a portion of the inheritance only <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the one who testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">from his portion, and nothing more? </span>If the other brothers admit that he is their brother, they should give him a share of their portions as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are saying: He is not our brother.</span>
The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> last clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">property came into </span>the possession of the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">from somewhere else, </span>and he died, <span class="gemarra-regular">the brothers of </span>the one who testified <span class="gemarra-regular">shall inherit </span>the man in question’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">with him.</span> Why should they inherit with him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t they say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: He is not our brother?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this ruling only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they say: We do not know</span> if he is our brother. Therefore, they are not obligated to give him a portion of their inheritance, as he cannot prove to them that he is their brother. Nevertheless, they can claim a portion of his inheritance after his death, on the basis of their brother’s testimony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: That is to say </span>that if one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I do not know, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>similar to this case, where the brothers who claim that they do not know if this person is their brother are not obligated to share their inheritance with him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>

Daf 135b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, I will say to you </span>that one who responds to a claim that he does not know if he owes the one hundred dinars is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay; <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, </span>in the case of the brothers, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different. </span>The brothers are not obligated to share their portion with the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the brother who testified <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>one who claims: <span class="gemarra-regular">Another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one hundred dinars in your possession. </span>Since the claimant is not the one who is owed the money, the other party can reject his claim by merely answering that he does not know whether he owes him.
§ The mishna teaches: If the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>he received from the father’s inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">shall return to its place, </span>i.e., to the possession of the brother who testified on his behalf, and if the man in question received property from elsewhere, it is inherited by all the brothers equally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the property </span>received by the man in question from the portion of the brother who testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>value was the result of an enhancement that <span class="gemarra-regular">happened naturally, </span>as opposed to one that resulted from exertion, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Who inherits it?
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to enhancement that reaches shoulders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., ripe produce that needs only to be harvested from the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not raise the dilemma, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like property that came into his possession </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from elsewhere. </span>It is not considered part of the land that was given to him by the brother who testified, and it is therefore divided among all the brothers. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the dilemma be raised with regard to enhancement that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not reach shoulders, </span>and is not considered separate from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as a palm tree that thickened, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">land that yielded silt. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? Is the enhancement included in the property itself, or is it considered separate property? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:10): <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>deed <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dayetikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and is collected by the designated recipient after the death of the giver? <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>deed <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it is written: This will be to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stand and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> after my death. <span class="gemarra-regular">And which </span>type <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> considered a deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift?

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span>considered a deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift only </span>if the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">From today and after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>is written, whereas if it is written only: <span class="gemarra-regular">From now, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>considered a deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift?

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna was sitting in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the balcony of Rav’s study hall, and sat and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: Write </span>a deed of transfer, granting property of mine to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and give</span> with it <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</span> he then <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not write and give</span> it.

Rabba bar Rav Huna continued that when Rabbi Yoḥanan stated this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said to </span>the other Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heed this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>; it is correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizevi said: </span>That is not what happened; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: Heed this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>to say that the incident was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the version presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rav Sheizevi. Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan needed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">affirm </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar. But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>was the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said it, did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar need to affirm </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his teacher?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Elazar </span>was the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, from another statement of his, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Ravin sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abbahu: Know that Rabbi Elazar sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exile in the name of our teacher, </span>stating that if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: Write </span>a deed of transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinars to so-and-so, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not write and give </span>it. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he resolved to transfer it only with a deed </span>of transfer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since the deed was not written in his lifetime it cannot be written after his death, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deed </span>of transfer is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death </span>of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>This ruling is correct; however, the wording of the deed <span class="gemarra-regular">should be examined.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>did Rabbi Yoḥanan mean by saying that the wording <span class="gemarra-regular">should be examined? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. The first was that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dayetikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cancels </span>a previous <span class="gemarra-italic">dayetikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The second explains the examination to which Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person on his deathbed who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Write </span>a deed of transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the court must <span class="gemarra-regular">see </span>what his intention was in instructing the other person to write a deed of transfer; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enhance </span>the recipient’s <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>by writing a document proving that he was given the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>the document even after his death, as he intended to give the money anyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, </span>rather it was the giver’s intention to transfer the gift specifically through a deed of transfer, <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not write </span>it and give the money, as a deed of transfer is not effective after the death of the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Memel raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Write </span>a deed of transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, one does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write and give </span>it. Rabbi Abba bar Memel inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed </span>states this request, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> writes and gives </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He raises the objection and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resolves it: </span>The ruling of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he was enhancing </span>the recipient’s legal <span class="gemarra-regular">power</span> by writing him a document of proof.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>under which it is apparent that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was enhancing his </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">power</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>

Daf 136a

It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Ḥisda says </span>that if it is written in the will: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we acquired it from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>through an act of acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">in addition to this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gift, </span>this formulation does not cancel the will’s power to take effect after the person’s death, as the intention of referring to it as a gift is merely to enhance the legal power of the recipient by confirming the transfer through an act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Write and sign </span>a document <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, and give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>it is apparent that his request is to enhance the legal power of the recipient by writing a document in addition to transferring the gift itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document <span class="gemarra-regular">and gives </span>the money in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says similarly </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document <span class="gemarra-regular">and gives </span>the money in this case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A healthy person <span class="gemarra-regular">who writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in his lifetime, but wishes to continue to derive benefit from it until his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">must write: </span>I give the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from today and after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: He need not </span>write: From today and after my death; it is sufficient for him to write that the transfer will take effect after he dies.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his son </span>from today and <span class="gemarra-regular">after his death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father cannot sell </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written </span>as granted <span class="gemarra-regular">to the son, and the son cannot sell </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the father </span>with regard to using the property and consuming its produce.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father sold </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sold </span>to the purchaser inasmuch as he may use it and consume its produce <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>at which point it belongs to the son. If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son sold </span>it during his father’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>right to use it <span class="gemarra-regular">until the father dies.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he wrote: </span>I give the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from today and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death, what of it? Didn’t we learn</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 72a): If a husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce from <span class="gemarra-regular">today</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not </span>a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">if he dies </span>without children his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">performs the ritual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through which a woman is freed of her levirate bonds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as perhaps the bill of divorce is invalid and she is bound by the levirate bond and may not remarry without first performing <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But she does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not enter into levirate marriage, </span>as perhaps the bill of divorce is valid, and it is forbidden for a divorcée to marry her former husband’s brother.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, we are uncertai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if</span> the expression: And after my death, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>meant as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> condition, </span>i.e., if I die you will be divorced retroactively from today, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if it is a retraction </span>of the statement: From today, meaning that the divorce would take effect only after his death, which would render it invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of a deed of gift, there is no contradiction in the statement, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">saying to him: Acquire </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">itself today, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce after </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not </span>write: From today and after my death. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh was sick, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna and Rav Naḥman entered to </span>visit <span class="gemarra-regular">him. Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Naḥman: Ask hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> whether the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei or </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning; </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">I ask him </span>about the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ask him if </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">or not, and I will tell you his reasoning</span> afterward.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>Rabba bar Avuh. Rabba bar Avuh <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. After</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they left, </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman that <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: He says </span>that writing: From today and after my death, is unnecessary because <span class="gemarra-regular">the date</span> written <span class="gemarra-regular">in a document proves </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>takes effect. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 8:4): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not </span>write: From today and after my death, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the date </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in a document proves </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>takes effect.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked Rav Naḥman: In </span>a case where the father performed an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer, </span>transferring his property to his son after his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it still necessary to write: From today and after my death? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: In </span>a case where he performed an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer, he need not </span>write: From today and after my death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: There is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">needs</span> to write: From today and after my death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer where </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not need</span> to do so. If it is written in the deed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and we, </span>the witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not need </span>to write: From today and after my death. But if the statement is written in the opposite order: <span class="gemarra-regular">We acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him and he transferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>he still <span class="gemarra-regular">need</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to write: From today and after my death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanina of Sura objects to this </span>distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anything that we, </span>the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not know, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scribes know? </span>The distinction between the two opposite orderings of the above statement was unknown to the Sages. The Gemara relates that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">asked Abaye’s scribes and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knew </span>the distinction, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they asked <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava’s scribes and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>the distinction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua, said: Whether </span>the wording is <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him and we acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">we acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him and he transferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">need not </span>write: From today and after my death, as the act of transfer is mentioned in any event. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>whether the phrase: From today and after my death, is necessary only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the deed merely states: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a record of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the proceedings that took place in our presence, </span>without any mention of an act of transfer.

§ The mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his son </span>from today and <span class="gemarra-regular">after his death, </span>neither he nor the son can sell the property. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated</span> that in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the son sold </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">during the father’s lifetime, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the son died</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the father’s lifetime, </span>after which the father died as well, 

Daf 136b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Reish Lakish says: The purchaser acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the property.
The Gemara explains their reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser did not acquire </span>the property because he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of the item itself. </span>Even though the property itself did not belong to the father, it is as though the father owned the property, because all of the produce belonged to him in practice. Therefore, the son’s sale can take effect only after the father’s death. If the son dies first, since he never attained ownership, his sale can never come to fruition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The purchaser acquired </span>the property, because he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the item itself. </span>Therefore, the father’s rights do not prevent the son, who owns the property itself, from selling it, and eventually the purchaser receives full rights to it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">engage in a dispute </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">one time? As it was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells his field for </span>just its <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, </span>meaning that he retains ownership over the field itself and he sells the rights to all of its produce to someone else, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>first fruits from this field to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites </span>the verses in the Torah associated with the bringing of the first fruits, in which he thanks God for: “The land that You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Reish Lakish says: </span>The purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>the first fruits, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not recit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the verses, since it is not his field.
The Gemara explains the reason behind the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says he brings </span>the first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites</span> the verses because <span class="gemarra-regular">he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of the item itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Even though the field itself does not belong to him, it is as if he acquired the field because all of the produce belongs to him in practice. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lakish says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings </span>the first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">and does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not recite </span>the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of</span> the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the item itself. </span>Why was it necessary for them to engage in a dispute concerning this issue twice?
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for the dispute to be stated also in the context of one who sells his father’s property and then dies. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">although in general ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">item itself, here it was necessary </span>to emphasize this principle, because it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a father and son, </span>the father presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>his rights in the property itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> that even in this case, the father’s ownership of the rights to use an item and the profits it engenders is considered to be like the ownership of the item itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">although</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in general ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of the item itself, </span>as one who sells the produce of his field retains full ownership of the land itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">here it was necessary </span>to emphasize this principle, as it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>sale <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning oneself, even vis-à-vis his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, one grants preference to himself. </span>Accordingly, if one grants the property itself to his son, reserving the rights to the produce for himself, he retains the rights to the property itself as well. Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he does not retain the rights to the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish</span> from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:4): If one states: <span class="gemarra-regular">My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property </span>will go <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>after my death for your use during your lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">and after you </span>die, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-and-so will inherit </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and after </span>the one who inherits after you dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inherit </span>the property, in this case, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, the second acquires </span>it, and when <span class="gemarra-regular">the second dies, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the third acquires </span>it.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the second dies during the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime of the first, the property returns </span>after his death <span class="gemarra-regular">to the heirs of the first, </span>and does not go to the third designated recipient, as his right was to inherit it from the second, who never received it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it is so </span>that ownership of the rights to use an item and the profits is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>stated that the property returns <span class="gemarra-regular">to the heirs of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the giver, </span>as the first and second recipients received only the right to use the property and enjoy its profits during their lifetimes, after which it was designated to be transferred to others. Therefore, in a case where the transfer does not apply, the property should return to the possession of the one who owns the property itself, namely the giver and his heirs.
Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rav Hoshaya already interpreted in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia </span>that a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">after you, </span>i.e., where the owner said to the recipient: After you die so-and-so will inherit the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the giver intended to grant full ownership of the property to the first recipient as well, including both the rights to the produce and the property itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna also raised </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction before Rav, and </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">After you, is different.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the second designated recipient dies before the first, after the death of the first the property <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to the heirs of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> giver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> 

Daf 137a

The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; as it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, and after you, to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">entered </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and consume</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the profits, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">repossesses </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchasers, </span>as the property belongs to him after the death of the first recipient; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The second </span>recipient receives <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that which the first </span>beneficiary <span class="gemarra-regular">left, </span>since his sale is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:4): If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property</span> is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, and after you, to so-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so, the first one may enter </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and consume </span>the profits; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first one has only </span>the right of <span class="gemarra-regular">consumption of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce.</span>
This statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>as it is contradicted by the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is difficult </span>as it is contradicted by the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. </span>Their opinions in the latter <span class="it-text">baraita</span> seem to be the opposite of those in the former <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span>ruling that the first one cannot sell it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the property <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling that he can sell it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the produce. </span>The apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult </span>either; <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement, that the first has only the right to consume the produce, is referring to his rights <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement, that if he sold the property the second one gets nothing, is referring to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fact.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: Who is a cunning wicked person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who provides advic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sell property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. </span>Although Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that the sale is valid, he does not permit one to do so <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, as that would deprive the second designated recipient of the property. Therefore, one who advises the first recipient to do so is considered a cunning wicked person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel; but </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the first recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the property to another <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the gift of a person on his deathbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case no formal act of acquisition is required, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has done nothing; </span>the second recipient can repossess the property from the one to whom it was given.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason? Abaye says: </span>The recipient of <span class="gemarra-regular">the gift of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed acquires </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">only after </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death, and </span>in this case, the acquisition of the recipient resulting from the statement of: <span class="gemarra-regular">After you, </span>i.e., the second designated recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">has already preceded </span>the acquisition of the first one.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Abaye</span> actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that the gift of a person on his deathbed takes effect only after his death? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it stated </span>in an amoraic dispute concerning the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">From when does </span>the recipient of <span class="gemarra-regular">the gift of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed acquire </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">With the completion of death, </span>i.e., at the moment he dies; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava says: After the completion of death.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye retracted that </span>latter statement. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>is it known <span class="gemarra-regular">that he retracted that </span>statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted this, </span>i.e., the statement that the recipient acquires it only after the person’s death, and his conclusion is that he acquires it at the moment of his death.
The Gemara answers: That possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">should not enter your mind, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 72b): If a man on his deathbed says to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divorce if I die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of divorce </span>if I die <span class="gemarra-regular">from this illness, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is your bill of divorce after I die, he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The divorce does not take effect after his death. Evidently, when one gives instructions on his deathbed, his intention is for them to be effective after he dies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gamliel </span>that if the first recipient sells the property, the sale is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if there were </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the first recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">emancipated them.</span>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">would have said to him: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not give you </span>my Canaanite slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">to transgress a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is prohibited to emancipate Canaanite slaves, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he has the legal right to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel even if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made </span>the gift into <span class="gemarra-regular">shrouds for a corpse. </span>The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the giver would have said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not give you </span>my possessions <span class="gemarra-regular">to render them into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">items from which </span>deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit is prohibited, </span>but rather so that you may use and enjoy them, and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he may do so.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: </span>If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is given to you as a gift, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after you </span>die, <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the first</span> recipient then <span class="gemarra-regular">took it and fulfilled </span>his obligation of taking the four species on the first day of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when one is obligated to take species that belong to him, in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the dispute between Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamliel </span>as to the nature of the ownership of the first recipient. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion that he cannot sell the <span class="it-text">etrog</span>, it is not considered entirely his, and he does not fulfill his obligation by taking it. According to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who holds that he can sell it, he fulfills his obligation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this </span>statement, reasoning that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only there, </span>in the case of: After you, with regard to the nature of the recipient’s ownership; <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of</span> the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered like ownership of the item itself, and</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of</span> the rights to use an item and the <span class="gemarra-regular">profits </span>it engenders <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered like ownership of the item itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.

Daf 137b

<span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fulfil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, for what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">give it to him?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilling </span>his obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he fulfills </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>It is only in a case where the first recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it or consumed it, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. </span>According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, if he sold it, the second recipient can repossess the <span class="it-text">etrog</span> from the purchaser, and if he consumed it he must pay the second recipient its value, whereas according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, he owes nothing to the second recipient, as the <span class="it-text">etrog</span> belongs to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who acquired an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>money from the jointly <span class="gemarra-regular">held </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the estate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them took it </span>on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>attempted to <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfill </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> depends on the limits of his ownership of the <span class="it-text">etrog</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat it, </span>i.e., his brothers allow him to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled </span>his obligation to perform the mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, he has not fulfille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> his obligation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the brothers; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the other brothers get merely <span class="gemarra-regular">a quince or a pomegranate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fulfilled his obligation even if he has the right to eat it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one person said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is given to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift on the condition that you return it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">took it </span>on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>attempted to <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfill </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, </span>if he ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it, he has fulfilled </span>his obligation; if he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not return it, he has not fulfilled </span>his obligation, as he did not fulfill the condition, thereby retroactively invalidating the gift. The Gemara explains that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gift </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that it be returne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who had a palm tree on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the land of Rav Beivai bar Abaye. Whenever she would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go to harvest </span>the produce from <span class="gemarra-regular">it, he would get </span><span class="gemarra-regular">angry at her </span>for trampling on his crops. Since she did not wish to anger him, <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>decided to temporarily waive her right to the tree’s produce, and <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">it to him </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all the years of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his life, </span>so that after his death she would once again be able to harvest the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and transferred it to his minor son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that it would remain in his family even following his death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said </span>to Rav Beivai bar Abaye: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because you descend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mula’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>people, as Rav Beivai’s family traced their lineage to Eli, all of whose descendants were condemned to premature death (see I Samuel 2:31), that <span class="gemarra-regular">you speak truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mulyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and unsound <span class="gemarra-regular">matters? Even Rabban Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Gamliel, </span>who holds that in a case where one says: My property is given to you, and after you, to so-and-so, if the first recipient sells the property the sale is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where it was to be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the giver said that it will return <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself, </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> say that the first recipient can sell it, as the giver clearly intended to maintain his ownership of the property. Accordingly, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, held that Rav Beivai’s sale did not take effect.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">This ox is given to you as a gift on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the condition that you return it to me, </span>and the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated it and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">returned i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is consecrated and returned. </span>The consecration takes effect, and although the owner may not use it, nevertheless it is considered returned and the condition is fulfilled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman: What did he return to him? </span>The ox was not returned to the possession of the giver, as it is consecrated. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did he cause him to lose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> He returned the ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: </span>We must rule in this case based on what <span class="gemarra-regular">we see. If </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the recipient: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the condition that you return it, </span>it is considered returned, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned it. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: On the condition that you return </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to me, he was </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">saying to him </span>that he must return <span class="gemarra-regular">something fit for him </span>to use. Consequently, the consecration prevents the condition from being fulfilled, and both the gift and the consecration are retroactively nullified.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one writes </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I do not want it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">standing and shouting </span>in protest that he does not want it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not acquire </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel said: And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they do not disagree </span>with each other: 

Daf 138a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is shouting</span> in protest <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As soon as he is given the deed of gift he states that he does not want it. In this case, he does not receive the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in Shmuel’s statement, it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is initially silent </span>when he receives the deed of gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">and is ultimately shoutin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> in protest that he does not want it. In this case he acquires the gift before he protests, so it is his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak says </span>that if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">transfers ownership </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">to him through anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> person, who performs an act of acquisition for this other party in his presence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was initially silent, </span>i.e., when the act of acquisition is performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">but ultimately shouted </span>in protest when the property is actually given to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:1): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to another, and there were slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> among his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">want them, if their second master, </span>i.e., the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">was a priest, they partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, as his protest is ignored. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once the other</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I do not want them, the </span>giver or his <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs have already acquired them, </span>and they are the slaves’ owners.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> hold that he acquires them <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he is standing and shouting </span>in protest that he does not want them? That is not reasonable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is shouting </span>in protest <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when he is given the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not acquire </span>them. In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> silent </span>at the time <span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately shouted </span>in protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agrees that he acquired </span>them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree </span>it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he transfers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ownership to him through another </span>person, and the recipient was there <span class="gemarra-regular">and was silent, and ultimately, </span>when he actually receives the slaves, he <span class="gemarra-regular">shouted </span>in protest. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">once he was </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">silent, he acquired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, and </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is shouting </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is retracting </span>his initial acceptance of the gift. His acquisition cannot be canceled in this manner. If he does not want to own the slaves, he can sell them, give them away, or emancipate them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his ultimate </span>actions <span class="gemarra-regular">prove </span>the nature of <span class="gemarra-regular">his initial </span>intent; he never intended to acquire the slaves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not shout </span>in protest <span class="gemarra-regular">until now </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he reasoned: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As long as they did not enter my possession, </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>end <span class="gemarra-regular">will I shout?</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:6): If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed said: Give two hundred dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to so-and-so, and three hundred to so-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so, and four hundred to so-and-so, </span>in this case one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever appears first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the deed acquires </span>his money first. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> promissory note emerged against </span>the one who gave the gifts, and it becomes clear that the money given was pledged to a creditor, then the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">collects from all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after him, to so-and-so, and after him, to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so, </span>then one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Anyone who appears first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the deed gains. Therefore, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a promissory note emerged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against </span>the giver, the creditor first <span class="gemarra-regular">collects from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>one of the recipients. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have </span>enough to repay the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">he collects from the previous </span>recipient. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have </span>enough to repay the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">he collects from </span>the recipient listed <span class="gemarra-regular">before the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">previous </span>recipient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as is appropriate for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the two hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes his portion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a firstborn </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he said: </span>Give my firstborn son two hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">for his portion as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, </span>he does not receive both, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he has the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">advantage; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he wants, he takes </span>the two hundred dinars, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he wants, he takes his portion as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as is appropriate for her, she takes </span>the two hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he said: </span>Give her two hundred dinars as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for her marriage contract, </span>

Daf 138b

<span class="gemarra-regular">she has the advantage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she wants, she takes </span>the two hundred dinars, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">she wants, she takes </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Give two hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dinars to so-and-so, my creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as is appropriate for him, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the two hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes </span>payment of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> debt </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said: </span>Give him two hundred dinars as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> debt, he takes </span>the two hundred dinars as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> debt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he says: As is appropriate for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, he takes </span>the two hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes </span>payment of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> debt </span>as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps he was saying: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As is appropriate for him </span>as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> debt, </span>and meant only to specify the amount of the debt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this? It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">expounds superfluous language. </span>Rabbi Akiva holds that if one uses unnecessary words, he apparently intended to add a matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (64a): One who sells a house without specification has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">neither the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pit nor the cistern [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he writes for </span>the buyer in the bill of sale: With <span class="gemarra-regular">its depth and its height. </span>This is because anything that is not part of the house, like pits and cisterns, must be explicitly mentioned in the contract or else they remain in the seller’s possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">must purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his, because he has sold the area of the house along with the house itself, and he no longer has permission to walk there. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis say: </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">need not purchase for himself a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> path </span>through the buyer’s domain, as this is certainly included in what he has withheld for himself from the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you this house <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from </span>the pit and the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not purchase for himself a path </span>through the buyer’s domain. Since the seller unnecessarily emphasized that the pit and the cistern are not included in the sale, he presumably intended to reserve for himself the right of access to them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>according to Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he did not need </span>to state: Apart from the pit and the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">and stated</span> it anyway, the seemingly superfluous statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was coming to add</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a matter. </span>Since the seller unnecessarily stressed that the pit and cistern are not included in the sale, he must have intended to thereby reserve for himself the right of access. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to the gift given by a person on his deathbed to his creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not need </span>to say: As is appropriate for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said </span>it anyway, this phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">was coming to add</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a matter, </span>i.e., that the two hundred dinars are in addition to the debt.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 8:18): If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who said: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have one hundred dinars </span>owed to me <span class="gemarra-regular">by so-and-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the witnesses </span>that hear this <span class="gemarra-regular">may write </span>his statement in a document <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they do not know </span>whether the statement is true. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, when </span>the person’s heir <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must bring proof </span>of the debt, as the document written by these witnesses is not regarded as proof. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>The witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">may not write </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they know </span>for a fact that the statement is true. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, when </span>the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need not bring proof </span>other than the document written by the witnesses, as it has the status of a promissory note.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Huna told me </span>that the opposite is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">may not write </span>his statement in a document they know for a fact that the statement is true, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they may write </span>it even if they do not know whether the statement is true; <span class="gemarra-regular">and even Rabbi Meir said </span>that they may not write it <span class="gemarra-regular">only due to </span>the concern that it might be presented before <span class="gemarra-regular">a court that errs </span>and allows the heirs to collect without furnishing additional proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Neharde’a says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no concern about </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a court that errs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from Rava’s </span>statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava says: </span>A court <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>supervise <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">recogniz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> and <span class="it-text">yevama</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a court <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>supervise a declaration of the <span class="gemarra-regular">refusa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of a girl upon her reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they recogniz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the girl. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>another court <span class="gemarra-regular">may write a document </span>attesting to the performance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitz</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a document </span>stating that a declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">of refusal </span>was made in a court elsewhere based on the testimony of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not recognize </span>these people, relying on the presumption the first court would not have allowed the act to be performed had they not been sure of the identities of the parties.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>Rava said that the court must recognize the participants in these actions? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to the concern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that a court that errs </span>might write such a document based on the testimony of witnesses without verifying that the participating parties were recognized by the court where the <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span> or refusal took place?
The Gemara answers: The two issues are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the same. <span class="gemarra-regular">A court does not </span>normally <span class="gemarra-regular">examin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> court, </span>so there is concern that the court where the document is written might assume that the court where the act took place recognized the participating parties. But <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">court does </span>normally <span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses. </span>Therefore, there is no concern that it will rely on a statement written by witnesses without their knowledge of its accuracy.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In continuation of the case discussed in the previous mishna of a father who wrote a document granting his property to his son but reserved the rights to the produce during his lifetime, the mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">the father may detach </span>produce from the land <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">to whomever he wishes, and what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he left detached </span>at the time of his death <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>all the father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs, </span>not only to this son.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna indicates that what the father left <span class="gemarra-regular">detached, yes, </span>it is inherited by all the heirs; but the produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">connected </span>to the ground at the time of his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is not inherited by them. Rather, it belongs to the son who received the property. 

Daf 139a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 8:5) that in a similar case, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises the </span>produce still <span class="gemarra-regular">connected </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purchase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the land, who must pay the seller’s heirs for it? Accordingly, the connected produce also belongs to the heirs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; here, </span>in the mishna, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who receives the connected produce after the father’s death. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another </span>person who purchased the land from the son. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since a person’s disposition is favorable toward his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the father certainly intended to bequeath the connected produce to his son together with the property itself. When the son sold it to another person, there was no such intention.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a person died and <span class="gemarra-regular">left adult </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and minor sons, the adults are not provided for by </span>using funds of <span class="gemarra-regular">the minors, and the minors are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sustained</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they do not receive food, <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span> using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of the adults. Rather, they receive a share</span> of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">equally, </span>and each son sees to his needs from his own share.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults married</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the minors marry, </span>as the Gemara will explain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the minors say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We are marrying in the same manner that you </span>adults <span class="gemarra-regular">married </span>during our father’s lifetime, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">listen to them. Rather, whatever their father gave </span>the adults in his lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>them, and the minors do not have the right to receive more than their share of the inheritance.
Similarly, if the father <span class="gemarra-regular">left adult and minor daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> but no sons, in which case his daughters inherit the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not provided for by </span>using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of the minors, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the minors are not sustained by </span>using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">adults. Rather, they receive a share </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">equally, </span>and each daughter sees to her needs from her share.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the adult </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">married</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the minor </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">marry, </span>as the Gemara will explain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the minors say: We are marrying </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the same manner that you </span>adults <span class="gemarra-regular">married </span>during our father’s lifetime, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not listen to them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>following <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stringency </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to daughters’ </span>inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">vis-à-vis sons’ </span>inheritance: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the daughters are sustained by </span>using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of the sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as stipulated in their mother’s marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they are not sustained by </span>using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eldest of the brothers who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> garments <span class="gemarra-regular">and covers himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the common property of <span class="gemarra-regular">the house, what he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">done</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the other brothers cannot subtract from his share of the inheritance as a result.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults are not provided for by </span>using funds <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the minors? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an unemployed person [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bisherakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas Rava was referring to the brother who handles the finances of the entire family. Therefore it is in the interest of all the brothers for him to wear appropriate attire.
The Gemara asks: If the mishna is referring to an <span class="gemarra-regular">unemployed person, </span>isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he may not take from the common inheritance of all the brothers? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for them </span>that he dress appropriately so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not be repulsive, </span>thereby dishonoring the family name, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he does not have the right to take money for clothing from the common inheritance, and if he does so, the brothers can subtract from his share of the inheritance as a result.
§ The mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults married, the minors marry. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it saying? </span>What does this mean?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> married after their father’s death </span>and used the common inheritance to pay for their weddings, <span class="gemarra-regular">the minors </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">marry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after their father’s death </span>may also pay for their weddings from the common inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults married</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during their father’s lifetime, and the minors said after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their father’s death: We will marry in the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> manner that you married, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not listen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them. Rather, whatever </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">their father gave </span>the adults to pay for their weddings in his lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>them, and the minors do not have the right to demand that same sum from the inheritance.
§ The mishna teaches that if the father <span class="gemarra-regular">left adult and minor daughters, </span>and the adults married, the minors marry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Avuh bar Geneiva sent </span>a question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Our teacher, instruct us: </span>If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consumed </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>before repaying the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">she arose and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> married</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> bringing her property into the marriage, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the husband </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a purchaser </span>of her property <span class="gemarra-regular">or is </span>he considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an hei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to her property?
The halakhic ramification of this dilemma is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is he </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a purchaser, and </span>the creditor therefore cannot collect his wife’s premarital debt from him, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not collect from the purchasers a loan by oral </span>agreement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he is </span>considered her <span class="gemarra-regular">heir, and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collects from the heirs a loan by oral </span>agreement.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We learned </span>the answer to this question in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the adult </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">married, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">minor </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">marry. What, is it not </span>teaching that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adult </span>daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">married, </span>each one of them transferring money from the common inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband </span>to cover the wedding expenses, <span class="gemarra-regular">the minor </span>daughters also <span class="gemarra-regular">marry, </span>paying for the wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the money that each elder sister transferred to her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband? </span>Clearly, although the money the elder daughters took from the inheritance for their weddings has the status of a loan by oral agreement, their husbands are liable to return it. This proves that the husbands are considered heirs.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the mishna is teaching that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults married </span>and each one transferred money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband, the minors </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">marry, </span>and each one may transfer money from the common inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband </span>for the wedding expenses. They cannot collect money from what was already transferred by their sisters to their husbands.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya teach </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adults married </span>and transferred money <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband, the minors marry </span>and collect money <span class="gemarra-regular">from the husband </span>of each elder sister?
The Gemara answers: Even according to this interpretation, there is no proof from the mishna with regard to the case of a loan by oral agreement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the provision of wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses </span>for the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as it generates publicity. </span>Since it is well known that a specific portion of a person’s estate is liened to the future wedding expenses of his single daughters, it has the status of a loan with a promissory note. Therefore, the younger daughters can collect from the husbands of the elder daughters even if the status of the husbands is that of purchasers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rava: Is this not </span>identical to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that Ravin sent in his letter </span>from Eretz Yisrael? That <span class="it-text">halakha</span> states that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who died and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left a widow and a daughter, his widow is sustained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his property. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">married, the widow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">sustained from his property, </span>although it is now in the possession of the daughter’s husband, as she had inherited the property from her father. With regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>and her husband inherited from her, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, son of the sister of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina, says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">incident occurred with me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the late man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">widow is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">sustained from his property </span>although it is fully owned by his daughter’s husband.
Rav Pappa explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an heir, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>father-in-law’s <span class="gemarra-regular">widow is sustained from his property; </span>it is still liened to her sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that a husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a purchaser </span>of his wife’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is his father-in-law’s widow <span class="gemarra-regular">sustained from his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property? </span>The purchasers of inherited property are not obligated to sustain the widow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: If Ravin had not sent </span>this letter, <span class="gemarra-regular">would we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not have known </span>that the husband has the status of a purchaser? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 52b): <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>properties <span class="gemarra-regular">do not return </span>to their original owners <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Jubilee </span>Year (see Leviticus 25:13–24): The portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it does not return to the common ownership of the brothers to be shared equally like the rest of the inheritance, but rather remains in the possession of the firstborn; 

Daf 139b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and one who inherits </span>the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> after her death, i.e., the property is not returned to her family. Evidently, the husband does not have the status of a purchaser, as a purchaser must return the property to its original owner in the Jubilee Year.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And now that </span>Ravin <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the letter, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">know </span>that the husband has the status of an heir? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">In Usha they instituted </span>an ordinance that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who sold her usufruct property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., property that she alone owns and her husband benefits only from the profits, <span class="gemarra-regular">in her husband’s lifetime and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, the husband repossesses </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchasers? </span>Apparently the husband’s status is that of a purchaser, as a purchaser can appropriate his purchase from a later purchaser, whereas an heir does not inherit property that the person sold before he died.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages equated the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">husband with an heir, and the Sages equated him with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a purchaser. And they deemed him </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever is better </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>based on the circumstances of the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jubilee </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages equated him with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to his </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">loss </span>were he to be equated with a purchaser, as he would be obligated to return the property to his wife’s heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>where the wife sold the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equated him with a purchaser, due to his </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">loss</span> were he to be equated with an heir. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Ravin’s </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, concerning the sustenance of the husband’s father-in-law’s widow, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of the widow, the Sages equated him with an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, there is a loss to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the purchasers, </span>from whom the husband appropriates the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages equated him with a purchaser.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the purchasers <span class="gemarra-regular">caused their own loss</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Since </span>they knew <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is a husband, they should not have purchased </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from a wife living under </span>the authority of <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>removing it from the husband and his heirs.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who died and left </span>behind both <span class="gemarra-regular">sons and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">when the estate is large the sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inheri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">and the daughters are provided with sustenance </span>from it according to the stipulations of the deceased’s marriage contract with their mother. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a small estate, </span>which is insufficient to provide for both the sons and the daughters, <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughters are provided with sustenance. And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons, </span>who receive in this case neither inheritance nor sustenance, have no other means with which to support themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>go and <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Admo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says, </span>rhetorically: <span class="gemarra-regular">I lost out </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">because I am male? </span>Rather, he holds that the sons also receive sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said: I see </span>as correct <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Admon.</span>

This <span class="gemarra-regular">was also stated </span>by other <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any </span>estate <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is large enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to provide sustenance from it for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those until </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">reach their majority is a large </span>estate; <span class="gemarra-regular">less than that, this is a small </span>estate.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is not </span>enough to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for these and those until </span>the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">reach their majority, </span>

Daf 140a

shall the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take all </span>of the estate, even if it is more than is required for their sustenance? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriates sustenance for the daughters until they reach their majority, and the remainder </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sons.</span>
§ The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if the estate was <span class="gemarra-regular">large and became small</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs, </span>i.e., the sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">already acquired i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> when it was large. It remains in their possession, and they must provide for the daughters from it. The Gemara asks: If the estate was <span class="gemarra-regular">small, </span>and was therefore not inherited by the sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then it <span class="gemarra-regular">became large</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does even a small estate <span class="gemarra-regular">remain in the possession of the heirs, </span>while the court reserves it for the daughters’ sustenance, and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore it appreciated in the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs </span>and they receive the appreciation in the estate’s value? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs are </span>totally <span class="gemarra-regular">removed from </span>possession of a small estate, and the appreciation in value is to the benefit of the daughters receiving sustenance.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans who preemptively sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> land <span class="gemarra-regular">from a small estate </span>left to them by their father, before the court appropriated it for the daughters’ sustenance, concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">that which they sold, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>is valid, even though they acted improperly. One can infer from this that a small estate remains in the possession of the heirs even when they are not authorized to derive benefit from it, and therefore the appreciation in its value belongs to them.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Abbahu and raised </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the sustenance to which the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wido</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> is entitled? Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate</span> when evaluating whether the estate is categorized as a large estate or a small estate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since she has </span>a right to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces </span>the value of the estate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since if she remarries she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">now as well, </span>for the purposes of determining the value of the estate, she is considered as if <span class="gemarra-regular">she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, and therefore it does not reduce the value of the estate.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if she remarries she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">now as well </span>she is considered as if <span class="gemarra-regular">she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, and it is not taken into account when evaluating the estate, then another dilemma can be raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the sustenance one pledged to give, for a certain number of years, to the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter of his wife </span>from a previous marriage, i.e., his step-daughter, which is an obligation not affected by his death or by her marriage? Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate? Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, when she marries she also has </span>a right to sustenance, it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces </span>the value of the estate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if she dies she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not reduce </span>the value of the estate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if she dies she does not have </span>a right to sustenance, therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not reduce</span> the value of the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a debt owed to the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor? </span>Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate? Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, when </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">dies he also has </span>a right to the money owed him, and it is collected by his heirs, therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces </span>the value of the estate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it has not yet been collected, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not reduce </span>the value of the estate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those who say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemmas in the opposite direction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in the reverse order: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a debt owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor? </span>Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate? </span>

Daf 140b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to sustenance the deceased pledged to give <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter of his wife </span>from a previous marriage? Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate? What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the sustenance to which <span class="gemarra-regular">his widow </span>is entitled? Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">reduce </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the estate? </span>Furthermore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his widow and daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which of them takes precedence </span>if the estate is insufficient to provide sustenance for both?
Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go now and come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow. When he came </span>back, Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Resolve at least one </span>of your questions, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>the status of the <span class="gemarra-regular">widow in relation to the daughte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>equivalent to the status of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter in relation to the brothers in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small estate.

§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Admon says, </span>rhetorically: <span class="gemarra-regular">I lost out </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">because I am male? </span>Rather, he holds that the sons also receive sustenance. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he saying? Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying: Because I am male, and I am fit to engage in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, I lost out </span>and must go begging instead of studying the Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: If that is so, </span>should one conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one who engages in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who inherits, </span>whereas one <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not engage in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah does not inherit? Rather, Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what Admon <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Because I am male, and I am fit to inherit in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a large estate, </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">I lose </span>my inheritance entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small estate?</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">sons and daughters and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose halakhic status as male or female is indeterminate, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the estate is large the males direct </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the females </span>and exclude him from the inheritance, claiming that perhaps the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> is female. When the <span class="gemarra-regular">estate is small, the females direct </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the males </span>and exclude him from receiving sustenance, claiming that perhaps the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> is male.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: If my wife gives birt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a mal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">shall receive </span>a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a male, </span>the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one hundred dinars. </span>If he says: If my wife gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>the offspring shall receive a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a female, </span>the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">receives two hundred </span>dinars.
If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>my wife gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a male </span>the offspring shall receive a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>she gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>the offspring shall receive a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a male and a female</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">male </span>offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one hundred dinars </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">female </span>offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">receives two hundred </span>dinars. If <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not receive </span>anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he said: Whatever </span>offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">my wife gives birth to shall receive </span>a gift of a certain sum, and she gave birth to a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">receives </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is no heir other than </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits all </span>of the estate.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the males direct the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> to the females. The Gemara asks: Does this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">they direct him, and he takes </span>sustenance <span class="gemarra-regular">like a daughter? Isn’t it taught </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause </span>of the mishna that if one said that either his male or female child will receive a certain sum once his wife gives birth, and <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not receive </span>anything? This indicates that the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> does not have the rights of a female. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>The mishna means that <span class="gemarra-regular">they direct him </span>to the females, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he has no </span>rights to sustenance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: They direct him </span>to the females <span class="gemarra-regular">and he has </span>a right to sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna, which grants the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> nothing at all, there <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Temura</span> 24b): If one consecrates a firstborn animal while it is still a fetus, stating that if it is male it shall be a burnt-offering and if it is female it shall be a peace-offering, and the mother <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a hermaphrodite [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">androginos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: It is not imbued with sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is neither male nor female. So too, in the case discussed in the mishna here, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> receives nothing, as he is considered to be a distinct entity of indeterminate sex, neither male nor female.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inherits as a son and is sustained as a daughter. Granted, according to Rava, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained to mean that the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">Inherits as a son, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small estate, </span>as the daughters direct the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> to the sons, and just as there is no inheritance for the sons, there is none for the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> either. And the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is sustained as a daughter, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a large estate, </span>as the sons direct the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> to the daughters, and the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> receives sustenance along with them. 

Daf 141a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, what </span>does it mean that the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is sustained as a daughter, </span>since Abaye maintains that the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> does not have the rights of a daughter? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rava, what </span>does it mean that a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits as a son, </span>since Rava concedes that the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> and sons do not actually inherit anything? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fitting </span>for the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to inherit but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not </span>actually inherit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to sustenance, according to Abaye, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fitting </span>for the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be sustained, but he is not </span>actually sustained.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: If my wife gives birth to a male </span>the offspring shall receive one hundred dinars, if she in fact gave birth to a male, the offspring receives one hundred dinars. If he says: If my wife gives birth to a female the offspring shall receive two hundred dinars, if she in fact gave birth to a female, the offspring receives two hundred dinars. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that for him a daughter is preferable to a son? But </span>this seems to contradict what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who does not leave </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">a son to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, is filled with wrath upon him, as it is stated: </span>“If a man dies, and has no son, <span class="gemarra-regular">then you shall cause his inheritance to pass [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’avartem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to his daughter” </span>(Numbers 27:8). The term <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’avara</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">wrath, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">evra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Zephaniah 1:15).
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the matter of inheritance, for him a son is preferable </span>to a daughter, as a son bears his name and retains his ancestral heritage within his father’s tribe, but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the matter of </span>providing for his offspring’s <span class="gemarra-regular">comfort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him his daughter is preferable </span>to his son, as a son is more capable of coping for himself and the daughter needs more support.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: Here we are dealing with </span>a mother who is <span class="gemarra-regular">giving birth for the first time, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says: </span>If one gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter first, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a good sign for sons. There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because she raises her brothers, </span>i.e., helps in their upbringing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the evil ey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have dominion over </span>the father. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: And </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">for myself, I prefer daughters to sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna in which preference is given to the daughter? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>is this referring to? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is referring to the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda with regard to </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“with everything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>that is difficult. The Gemara cites Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 24:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>The blessing was <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not have a daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The blessing was <span class="gemarra-regular">that he had a daughter, and her name </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">Bakkol. </span>Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda understands the birth of a daughter to be a blessing. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda </span>explain that the blessing was that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One did not even deprive Abraham </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a daughter, </span>in addition to his sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">Did you hear him </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a daughter is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable to a son?</span>
The Gemara proposes another of Rabbi Yehuda’s statements: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One is not halakhically obligated to provide sustenance for his children beyond the age of six. Nevertheless, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva to provide sustenance for the daughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>one can infer <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> that it is certainly a mitzva to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for sons, who are engaged in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva to provide sustenance for the sons. And </span>one can infer <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> that it is certainly a mitzva to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for daughters, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that they not be disgraced </span>by having to beg for their livelihood. This indicates that with regard to providing sustenance for one’s children, Rabbi Yehuda gives preference to the daughters.
§ The mishna discusses a case where one stipulated that if his wife gives birth to a male the offspring shall receive one hundred dinars, and if she gives birth to a female the offspring shall receive two hundred dinars. The mishna states that if she gave birth to both a male and a female, the male receives one hundred dinars and the female receives two hundred. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:4): If she <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a male and a female, the male receives six dinars </span>of gold, which are equivalent to one hundred fifty dinars of silver, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the female receives two dinars </span>of gold, equivalent to fifty dinars of silver, <span class="gemarra-regular">with what </span>situation is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> dealing?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: I said this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Kahana, </span>and he explained it as teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">about one who inverted </span>the stipulations of his gift. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a male </span>is born <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>he will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>is born <span class="gemarra-regular">after him </span>she will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing. </span>And if <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>is born <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>she will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars, </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">a male </span>is born <span class="gemarra-regular">after her </span>he will receive <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars. And </span>the mother <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a male and a female, but we do not know which of them emerged </span>from the womb <span class="gemarra-regular">first. </span>In this case, the <span class="gemarra-regular">male takes one hundred dinars, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever way you </span>look at it, this sum is due to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">The other one hundred dinars are property of uncertain ownershi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and are divided</span> equally between the male and female.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to a male and a female, he </span>receives <span class="gemarra-regular">only one hundred dinars, how can you find these </span>circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <span class="gemarra-regular">informs me. </span>

Daf 141b

This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:5): In a case where one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever informs me </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">to what opened my wife’s womb, </span>i.e., what the sex of her child is, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a male, </span>the one who informs me <span class="gemarra-regular">shall receive one hundred dinars. </span>Therefore, if the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a male, </span>the one who informed him <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one hundred dinars. </span>If he also said: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>he shall receive <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to a female, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one hundred dinars. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth to a male and a female, he </span>receives <span class="gemarra-regular">only one hundred dinars.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>anything about <span class="gemarra-regular">a male and a female, </span>if she gave birth to a male and a female, he should not receive anything. Why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> state that he receives one hundred dinars? The Gemara answers: This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he also said: If </span>she gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a male and a female </span>he shall <span class="gemarra-regular">also receive one hundred dinars. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he stated all of the possibilities, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>did his stipulations serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? </span>The Gemara answers: They serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case where she gives birth to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-viable newborn, </span>in which case he receives nothing.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife: My property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one with whom you are pregnant. Rav Huna said: This is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus, and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>opinion from the mishna, which states: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: If my wife gives birth to a male </span>the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">shall receive one hundred dinars, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to a male, </span>the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one hundred dinars. </span>This indicates that the fetus did acquire the money. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I do not know who taught our mishna. </span>It is not identifiable with a known opinion, and presumably the text has been corrupted.
The Gemara asks why Rav Huna replied in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let him say to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says: A person can transfer ownership </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world, </span>e.g., produce that has not yet grown. Just as he maintains that one can transfer ownership of an entity that has not yet come into the world, so too, he maintains that one can transfer ownership of an item to a fetus, who has not yet been born.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard Rabbi Meir </span>express this opinion with regard to transferring ownership of an entity that has not yet come into the world <span class="gemarra-regular">to an entity that is in the world. Did you hear him </span>speak of transferring ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">to an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world, </span>e.g., a fetus?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who says: A fetus acquires </span>ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> 67a): With regard to an Israelite woman who married a priest and he died and left her pregnant, the <span class="gemarra-regular">fetus disqualifies</span> its father’s Canaanite slaves from partaking of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, because until it is born the fetus is not considered a priest, and the slaves, who are part of its inheritance, are not the slaves of a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not enable </span>its mother <span class="gemarra-regular">to partake </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, even though it is the child of a priest. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei. </span>It is evident from this mishna that Rabbi Yosei holds that a fetus inherits its father’s property.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Inheritance is different, </span>since, unlike a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">it comes </span>into the possession of the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>without a formal act of acquisition. Therefore, a fetus can acquire an inheritance, but not a gift.
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says: </span>The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an inheritance is not different, and </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift</span> one gives to his heir <span class="gemarra-regular">is not different, </span>i.e., the same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply to both. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (130a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If one said about </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., one of his sons: This person will inherit all of my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands.</span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</span> express this opinion with regard to a gift given <span class="gemarra-regular">to an entity that </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">exists in the world, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">does he say </span>anything with regard to a gift given <span class="gemarra-regular">to an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world?</span>
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span>who compares a gift to an inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>that a fetus is fit to inherit. The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who says that </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yosei?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman that the mishna is referring not to one who gave a gift to the fetus, but <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <span class="gemarra-regular">informs me.</span> This person is in the world. The Gemara rejects this explanation as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And if there is no heir other than </span>the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits all </span>of the estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <span class="gemarra-regular">informs me, what is the purpose of </span>mentioning <span class="gemarra-regular">an heir, </span>since the mishna is not discussing a gift to the heir at all?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman: The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the gift was made after his wife had already <span class="gemarra-regular">given birth</span> but he did not yet know the sex of the baby. The Gemara rejects this explanation as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Whatever </span>offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">my wife gives birth to shall receive </span>a certain sum, and she gave birth to a <span class="it-text">tumtum</span>, the <span class="it-text">tumtum</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">receives </span>it, there is a difficulty. According to this explanation, the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whatever </span>offspring my wife <span class="gemarra-regular">gives birth to, </span>is incorrect. The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: Whatever </span>offspring my wife <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth to. </span>

Daf 142a

The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rav Naḥman that the mishna is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the transfer of ownership should take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when she gives birth, </span>at which point the child already exists. The Gemara rejects this resolution: Rav Huna does not interpret the mishna in this way, because <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rav Huna says: Even </span>if one says that the transfer of ownership should take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when she gives birth, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Naḥman says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it. But if he says that the transfer of ownership of the item should take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when she gives birth, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Even </span>if he says that the transfer of ownership of the item should take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when she gives birth, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it, because the fetus did not exist in the world when he transferred ownership. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do I say </span>that the fetus acquires the item? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert who died, </span>apparently without offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Jews plundered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvizbezu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> assuming that he had no heirs and his property was therefore ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">they heard that he had a son or that his wife was pregnant, they are obligated to return </span>the property. If <span class="gemarra-regular">they returned it all, and then they heard that his son died or that his wife miscarried, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession at the second </span>time, after hearing about the death or the miscarriage, he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if one took possession only <span class="gemarra-regular">at the first </span>time, before it was known there was an heir at all, he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>the property.
Rav Sheshet explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a fetus does not acquire </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do they </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">take possession </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>time? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">take possession one time? </span>Evidently, the miscarried fetus had acquired ownership in the meantime.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in reply to Rav Sheshet: <span class="gemarra-regular">Inheritance, which comes </span>into the possession of the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself </span>without a formal act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different. </span>Even if a fetus inherits property, it may not be able to acquire property in any other manner, e.g., receiving a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>in the case where they plundered the property of the convert, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">was initially </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">loosely held in their hands, </span>as they did not clearly know whether or not the deceased convert had heirs. Therefore, the first time they took possession was not sufficient, and they needed to take possession again in order to acquire the property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>Abaye’s refutation and Rava’s refutation? The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>and they then took possession of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in reality, he had <span class="gemarra-regular">not died, and then </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">died. </span>According to Abaye, a fetus inherits property. Therefore, the property was not ownerless, and the plunderers did not acquire it. According to Rava, since the plunderers heard that the fetus had died, they took a firm hold upon the property, and they acquired it the first time.
The Gemara offers another refutation of the opinion of Rav Sheshet: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 43b–44a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A one-day-old child inherits </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeaths </span>property. One can infer that if the child is <span class="gemarra-regular">one day old, yes, </span>he inherits property; but <span class="gemarra-regular">a fetus </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not. </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rav Sheshet say </span>that the mishna teaches a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The mishna teaches that a one-day-old child <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits his mother’s propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the moment he is born, so that he is able <span class="gemarra-regular">to bequeath </span>it, if he then dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his heirs who are not the mother’s heirs, e.g., his <span class="gemarra-regular">paternal brothers. </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>applies from when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">one day old, but a fetus </span>whose mother died <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>inherit from her. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? 

Daf 142b

The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>we presume that the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">died first, </span>before its mother died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the son does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not inherit from his mother </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave, </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to bequeath </span>the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brothers. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if a son dies, and afterward his mother dies, the deceased son does not inherit from his mother and subsequently bequeath the inheritance to his paternal brothers, who are not related to the mother. But in other cases, where it is not his mother’s estate, a fetus inherits property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>it is certain that the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">died first? But there was an incident </span>where the mother died <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">made three spasmodic motions </span>afterward. Apparently, a fetus can die after the mother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: </span>That incident was <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is with the tail of the lizard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which jerks </span>after being severed from the lizard, but it is just a spasmodic motion which does not indicate that it is still alive.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: </span>The mishna comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>a one-day-old child <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces the portion of the firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, and this is calculated taking into account the portion due to his dead brother. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is in this context that <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>the portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a one-day-old </span>child is taken into account, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fetus is not </span>taken into account, even though a fetus also inherits property. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>concerning the portion of the firstborn: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they bore him children, </span>both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15). The term “children” excludes a fetus.
This is similar to another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: A son who was born after his father’s deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not reduce the firstborn’s portion. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they bore him children,” and this </span>term “children” <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>apply to a fetus.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">In Sura they taught </span>Mar’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>way, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in Pumbedita they taught </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>way: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: A firstborn who was born after his father’s deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not receive a double </span>portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: “But <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall acknowledge</span> the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in this case the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">acknowledge </span>him. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with all these versions </span>of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava. </span>Accordingly, a one-day-old child reduces the portion of the firstborn, a son born after his father’s death does not reduce the firstborn’s portion, and a firstborn born after his father’s death does not receive a double portion.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the item. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna </span>(140b), with regard to one who gives a gift to his unborn child, indicates that an item can be transferred to a fetus, the circumstances there are unique. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the disposition of a person </span>is to be <span class="gemarra-regular">inclined toward his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Sages validated such a transfer, but one cannot transfer an item to the unborn child of another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to Rav Ḥana of Baghdad: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring me an assembly of ten </span>men, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will say </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to you in their presence, </span>so that it will be well publicized. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the item. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers ownership </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a fetus, </span>the fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the item.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife, </span>before she conceived: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sons that I will have from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> His older son </span>from a previous marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: That man, </span>i.e., me, <span class="gemarra-regular">what will become of him, </span>i.e., will I receive nothing? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>his son: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>a portion <span class="gemarra-regular">like one of the sons </span>who will be born, i.e., you will receive a share as well. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>sons who were not yet born <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly did not acquire </span>the property, and do not receive more than their share as heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are not yet </span>in existence.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> son, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the young man [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">letalya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> receive an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">shar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the inheritance in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons </span>from the second wife, since his father gave him an additional share, <span class="gemarra-regular">or does the young man not </span>receive an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">share </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons? </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Meyasha, and Rabbi Yirmeya, who </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">say: The young man does </span>receive an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">share </span>of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons. </span>And there are <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu, and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, who </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">say: The young man does not </span>receive an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">shar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there are other <span class="gemarra-regular">sons.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said to Rabbi Yirmeya: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with our </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with your </span>opinion? Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abbahu: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with our </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we are older than you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as you are youngsters [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dardekei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does the matter depend upon age? The matter depends upon the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> behind the ruling. Rabbi Yirmeya asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">reason? </span>Rabbi Abbahu replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go to Rabbi Avin, as I explained </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>

Daf 143a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and he nodded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vekharkeish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his head </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall </span>in approval <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>explanation. Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">went to </span>Rabbi Avin, who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Rabbi Abbahu’s reasoning is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a father <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>his son: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">as a donkey </span>does, <span class="gemarra-regular">does he acquire </span>it? In the same manner that the son would not acquire anything if his acquisition were likened to that of a donkey, which possesses no ability to acquire an item, so too, since the father compared the son’s acquisition to the acquisition effected by his unborn children, who possess no ability to acquire property, the son did not acquire any property.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated: </span>With regard to one who says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">as a donkey </span>does, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>any property, as a donkey cannot acquire property. But with regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">You and a donke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> shall both acquire my property, there is a disagreement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>The person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Hamnuna says: </span>It is as though the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say anything. </span>Since the beneficiary was included with the donkey in the same acquisition, he does not acquire any property, just as the donkey does not acquire any property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>The person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires all </span>the property. As the giver knew that a donkey cannot acquire property, he intended for the person, who was capable of acquiring property, to acquire all the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say this? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: There is nothing bitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the cucumbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other than its inner </span>part, which is sometimes bitter and inedible and unfit to be separated as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>since one does not know if the cucumber he separates as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is bitter inside, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>part of another cucumber as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, in addition <span class="gemarra-regular">to the outer </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the cucumber, which is edible. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he separates </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>thereby ensuring that the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> consists of sufficient edible cucumber.
Rav Sheshet asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does the separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> take effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span>not analogous to one who states: <span class="gemarra-regular">You and a donkey </span>shall acquire an item, since he designated as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> both the outer part of the cucumber, which is fit to become <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, and the inedible inner part, which is not fit to become <span class="it-text">teruma</span>? Since this does not invalidate the separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> with regard to the edible outer part, one can infer that although the donkey cannot acquire property, this does not prevent the person from acquiring the property.
The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, as by Torah law </span>the bitter inner part <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">properly </span>considered <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>even though by rabbinic law if one separated inferior produce as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> he must again separate produce of superior quality as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Therefore, when one designates the entire cucumber as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, he is not designating both fit and unfit produce.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ile’a says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from poor-</span>quality produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for superior-</span>quality produce is <span class="gemarra-regular">that his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">teruma</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it the best thereof”</span> (Numbers 18:32). By inference, this indicates that it is a transgression to separate the inferior part of the produce as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Rabbi Ile’a explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the inferior produce <span class="gemarra-regular">is not sanctified </span>as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does it involve the <span class="gemarra-regular">bearing of sin, </span>as it is a meaningless act? <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>one can derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from poor</span>-quality produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for superior-</span>quality produce is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>although he acted improperly, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara cited Rav Hamnuna’s opinion that if one says: You and a donkey shall acquire my property, he did not say anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: Rav Avya raises an objection </span>to Rav Hamnuna’s opinion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 50b): <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving five women</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and among them </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">two sisters, and one person gathered a baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of figs that belonged to them, and </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">was of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: You are hereby all betrothed to me with this basket, and one of them accepted </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of all of them. The Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is prohibited to marry the sister of one’s wife during her lifetime.
One can infer from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>only the <span class="gemarra-regular">sisters who are not betrothed, but </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">unrelated women </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed. But why </span>is that so? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>analogous to one who states: <span class="gemarra-regular">You and a donkey </span>shall acquire an item. Since he tried to betroth two women ineligible for betrothal together with the eligible women, the betrothal should not take effect even with regard to the eligible women.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Mordekhai: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is why I saw Rav Huna bar Avya in a dream, because </span>you were going to tell me that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avya raised an objection </span>to Rav Hamnuna’s opinion. But as for this objection, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we interpret </span>the mishna in <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: Those of you who are eligible for </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse </span>with me <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be betrothed to me? </span>Since the sisters were forbidden to him, they were not included in the betrothal in the first place, and there was no impediment to the betrothal of the eligible women taking effect. The case is therefore not comparable to the case discussed by Rav Hamnuna.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife: My property is given to you and to your sons. Rav Yosef says: </span>In such a case, the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires half </span>of the property, even though the man did not specify how much of his property he was giving her. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons” </span>(Leviticus 24:9). This means <span class="gemarra-regular">half for Aaron </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">half for his sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One can infer from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that when it is specified that a gift is to be divided between an individual and a group, the intention is that the individual receives half.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, there, </span>in the case of the shewbread, <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron is eligible to receive a share </span>of the shewbread as a priest; it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One specified him </span>separately, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should take </span>more than other priests, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">half. </span>But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, who is not eligible to inherit </span>her husband’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sufficient for her to receive </span>a portion of the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">as one of the sons, </span>not half of all the property.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But there was an incident in Neharde’a </span>where a man gave a gift to an individual and to a group of people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel collected half </span>the sum for the individual. There was a similar case <span class="gemarra-regular">in Tiberias, and Rabbi Yoḥanan collected half </span>the sum for the individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came </span>from Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain coronation tax that was placed by the royal house on the city councilmen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a’abulei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on the prominent citizens [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’a’isterugei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Let the city councilmen give half and the prominent citizens half. </span>This indicates that when two groups are mentioned together, the intent is that each one represents half.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>the case concerning the tax <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared </span>to the other cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">There, initially, when they would write </span>the writ of assessment, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would write </span>that it was placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the city councilme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the prominent citizens would assist them </span>in raising the sum, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the king knew that they were assisting </span>them. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">what they wrote: </span>It is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the city councilmen and on the prominent citizens, is to say that these </span>should give <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the tax, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>should give <span class="gemarra-regular">half.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises an objection </span>to Rav Yosef’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 12:7): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: It is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal-offering </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred tenths </span>of an ephah <span class="gemarra-regular">in two vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he brings sixty-</span>tenths <span class="gemarra-regular">in one vessel, and </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">forty-</span>tenths <span class="gemarra-regular">in one vessel, </span>as no more than sixty-tenths may be brought in a single vessel. 

Daf 143b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he brought fifty-</span>tenths <span class="gemarra-regular">in one vessel and fifty in one vessel, he fulfilled </span>his obligation. One can infer from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that after the fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>fifty-tenths in each vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he fulfilled his obligation, but he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if it should enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">every case like this is </span>divided <span class="gemarra-regular">half and half, </span>it should be permitted to divide the meal-offering into equal halves <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara dismisses Rabbi Zeira’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of the meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is clear to us that this person initially intended to </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a large offering, and </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said </span>he will bring the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in two vessels </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">that he knew that it is not possible to bring </span>the entire offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in a single vessel. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we bring, </span>in a single vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is possible to bring, </span>which is sixty-tenths. In any other case it is possible that the division should be into two equal portions.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> in three matters where he disagreed with Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the matter of dividing <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field </span>between brothers (see 12b); in the matter of whether certain actions are limited by the court session or by the <span class="gemarra-regular">topic </span>of discussion in the court (see 114a); <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">half, </span>i.e., this matter, whether an unspecified division into two parts is divided into two equal halves.
§ The Gemara cites additional incidents concerning a gift whose method of division was not specified: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who sent swaths of sil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his home </span>as a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami says </span>that in such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>swaths that are <span class="gemarra-regular">suitabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sons’ </span>garments are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sons, </span>and those that are <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters’ </span>garments are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the daughters. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We said this only when he does not have daughters-in-law, but if he has daughters-in-law, </span>it is presumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for his daughters-in-law. And if his daughters are not married, </span>it is presumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not forsake his daughters and send to his daughters-in-law, </span>so the silk is given to his daughters.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>those surrounding him: I leave <span class="gemarra-regular">my property to my sons [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">levanai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a son and a daughter. </span>The question was raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do people call </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>in the plural: <span class="gemarra-regular">My sons, and </span>in his will <span class="gemarra-regular">he came to remove his daughter </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tenth </span>of his property that would rightfully be her dowry? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps people do not call </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">son: My sons, and he came to include </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter in the gift?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that one does refer to a single son using the plural term sons, as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of Dan: Hushim” </span>(Genesis 46:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>this verse should be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, </span>that Hushim is not the name of Dan’s son but <span class="gemarra-regular">that they, </span>Dan’s sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">were as numerous as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">groups [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥushim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of reeds. Rather, Rava said: </span>One can prove this usage of the term sons in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of Pallu: Eliab” </span>(Numbers 26:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This can be proven from another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of Ethan: Azariah” </span>(I Chronicles 2:8).
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to </span>those surrounding him: I leave <span class="gemarra-regular">my property to my sons, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he had a son and a grandson</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his son’s son. The question was raised: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">people call a grandson a son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">not? Rav Ḥaviva said: People call a grandson a son. Mar bar Rav Ashi said: People do not call a grandson a son. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Mar bar Rav Ashi: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from </span>a certain person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sons of </span>that person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, </span>as they are not included in the term sons.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>died and <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>behind <span class="gemarra-regular">adult and minor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the adult </span>sons <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">they enhanced </span>it so that the profit goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middle, </span>i.e., it is distributed among all the heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the adult sons <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>from the outset: <span class="gemarra-regular">See that which </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">father left </span>behind; <span class="gemarra-regular">we are </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">engage </span>in business with our share of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and profit </span>from it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">they enhanced </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wife who enhanced the property </span>of her deceased husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she enhanced </span>it so that the profit goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middle, </span>i.e., it is divided between her and the heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">If she said: See that which my husband left me; I am </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">engage </span>in business with my share <span class="gemarra-regular">and profit </span>from it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">she enhanced </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for herself.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥaviva, son of Rav Yosef, son of Rava, says in the name of Rava: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property was enhanced on account of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the heirs invested money from the common inheritance in order to enhance the property, and their input was only in the management of its investment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">property was enhanced on their account, </span>i.e., on account of the efforts or expenditure of the adult sons, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they enhanced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for themselves.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them nothing but</span>

Daf 144a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a mortar [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">udaini</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which people pay to use, <span class="gemarra-regular">the rent </span>goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middle? But isn’t </span>the profit accruing from <span class="gemarra-regular">a mortar </span>considered profit accruing <span class="gemarra-regular">on his, </span>i.e., the adult son’s, <span class="gemarra-regular">own account, </span>as the adult son must supervise its operation, and there is no outlay from the property? The Gemara dismisses this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">A mortar is different, as for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">typical use </span>it can suffice <span class="gemarra-regular">with supervision</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and even minors are able to supervise its </span>use. Since the adults do not contribute anything more than the minors, they cannot demand a greater share of the profits.
§ The mishna teaches: If the adult sons <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> from the outset: <span class="gemarra-regular">See that which </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">father left </span>behind; <span class="gemarra-regular">we are </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">engage </span>in business with our share of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and profit </span>from it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">they enhanced </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for themselves. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra’s father left </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">dinars. </span>Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">took them </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">entered </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a business venture with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> His brothers came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">charged him in </span>a court of <span class="gemarra-regular">law before Rava, </span>claiming their share of the profits. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Rav Safra is a great man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not abandon his studies and toil for others. </span>It is therefore clear that if he invested the money, it was for his own profit, even if he did not explicitly declare so at the outset.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wife who enhanced the property </span>of her deceased husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she enhanced </span>it so that the profit goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middle. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife doing with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans’ property? </span>What rights does she have to the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a wife </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">an heiress, </span>e.g., if she were the daughter of her husband’s brother, and both brothers died without leaving sons, in which case she inherits in her father’s stead.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case is the same as with regard to any other heir? The Gemara replies: It is necessary to state this, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is not </span>a woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">way to toil </span>to enhance property, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even though she did not expressly state </span>that she is toiling for herself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as though </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">had expressly stated </span>this. The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that only if she expressly stated this do the profits accrue to her.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if she said: See that which my husband left me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I am </span>going to <span class="gemarra-regular">engage </span>in business with my share <span class="gemarra-regular">and profit </span>from it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">she enhanced </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for herself. </span>The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara explains: It is necessary to state this, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is praiseworthy for her </span>to enhance the property on behalf of the orphans, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>people will <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>See how <span class="gemarra-regular">she toils for the orphans, she relinquishes </span>her right to the profits and they should divide them equally. The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who marries a woman to his eldest so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and arranges the wedding feast <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house </span>that he designated for the purpose of the wedding canopy and the wedding feast, the son <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the house as a gift. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">eldest</span> son, <span class="gemarra-regular">and specifically </span>if he is marrying <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, and specifically </span>when this woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">his first wife, and specifically when </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">married him off first </span>among his sons. When all these conditions exist, it is presumed that the father has a particular fondness toward the son, due to which he gave him the house.
The Gemara clarifies the details of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">his father designated a house for</span> the son’s nuptials <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an upper story </span>above the house, the son <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the house, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not acquire the upper story. </span>If he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>for the son, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’akhsadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in front of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses, one within the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the inner one was designated for the son’s nuptials, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara concludes: These questions <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">his father designated a house and furnitur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for his </span>son’s nuptials, the son <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired the furniture, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not acquire the house. Rabbi Yirmeya says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his father’s storeroom was placed there. </span>It is clear that just as his father did not intend to give him the storeroom, neither did he intend to give him the house. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: Even </span>if there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">a dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the house that belongs to the father, the son does not acquire the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda and Rav Pappi say: Even </span>if there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">a pot [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atzitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">fried fish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the son does not acquire the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra married off his son, and hung a sandal </span>in the house, to indicate that he did not intend to give the house as a gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi married off his son, and hung a jug [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ashisha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of oil </span>in the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra says: These three matters were instituted by the Sages as a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without any explanation </span>of their process, i.e., they instituted these enactments despite the fact that the mechanism by which they function is unclear: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the son acquiring the house designated for his nuptials. <span class="gemarra-regular">Another </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: One who writes </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renders her only a steward </span>of his property, i.e., he intends only to put her in charge of the property and she does not acquire it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Another </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav says: </span>With regard to one who says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession; give it to so-and-so, </span>if this occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>parties, that third person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it, without need of witnesses or a formal act of acquisition. 

Daf 144b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who were </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">partners, </span>and it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">that one of them was summoned to </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is assessed per family, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was summoned from the middle, </span>i.e., the profits or expenses of his service are divided among them. If one of the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">became sick and sought treatment, the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">treatment is </span>paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>resources.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: This service </span>mentioned in the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>forced <span class="gemarra-regular">imperial service, </span>but if one of the brothers engaged in a trade of his own volition, the profits are his alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:5): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the brothers who was appointed </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a tax </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collecto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a military commander [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">polmustos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a position with the potential for profit, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he was appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the procedure was to impress a representative from each family for this purpose, any profit accrues <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular">he brothers.

The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he was appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the brothers, </span>then the profit accrues <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the brothers? </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the brother appointed was <span class="gemarra-regular">sharper, </span>i.e., more capable, than the other brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his sharpness caused him </span>to be selected for the position, and he should receive all the profits, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that his talent notwithstanding, since he was selected as a representative of the family, the profit accrues to all the brothers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the brothers, who took two hundred dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the common inheritance to support himself when he went to another place <span class="gemarra-regular">to study Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to learn a trade, the brothers can say to him: If you are </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">with us, you are entitled to sustenance </span>along with us. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you are not </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">with us, you are not entitled to sustenance.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shouldn’t they give him </span>his sustenance <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever he is? </span>The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: The blessing of the house </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in its abundance. </span>This means that the extent to which blessing permeates a home is proportionate to the number of people who live there, and when many people live together the expenses per capita decrease. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But shouldn’t they give him </span>his sustenance <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the blessing of the house, </span>i.e., the expenses he would incur even if he were in the house? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, </span>they are required to provide for those expenses that he would incur in any event.
§ The mishna teaches: If one of the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">became sick and sought treatment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">treatment is </span>paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>resources. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ela: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he became ill through negligence. But </span>if he became ill <span class="gemarra-regular">through circumstances beyond his control, </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the treatment is </span>paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from the middle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., from the common inheritance. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the circumstances in </span>which it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: All </span>occurrences that befall man <span class="gemarra-regular">are in the hand of Heave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for colds </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">obstacles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">paḥim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which one is able to protect himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them” </span>(Proverbs 22:5).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It was common practice for friends of a groom to give him gifts in order to help cover the expenses of the wedding feast. These gifts are known as gifts of groomsmen, and would be reciprocated in turn. While the groom and the groomsman were at times the recipient and the giver of the gifts, respectively, the gifts were at times provided by the father of the groomsman and received by the father of the groom. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, some of whom brought gifts of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">groomsme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in their father’s lifetime, </span>which were provided by their father, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated </span>after the father’s death, when one of the brothers gets married, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are reciprocated to the middle, </span>i.e., the gift is divided among the brothers. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because gifts of groomsmen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>a legal debt owed to the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">collectible in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends his friend jugs of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or jugs of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a reciprocal gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is not collectible in court, because they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">acts of kindness.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between the mishna’s ruling that the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated to the middle, and the first clause of a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a father sent </span>his son with <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts of groomsmen, when they are reciprocated </span>when that son gets married, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are reciprocated to </span>that son. If <span class="gemarra-regular">his father was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">groomsme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for the wedding of one of his sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they are reciprocated </span>from the father’s estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are reciprocated from the middle, </span>i.e., the cost of the gift is divided among the brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When we learned the mishna as well, we learned </span>it as teaching the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to gifts of groomsmen that <span class="gemarra-regular">were sent to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>for the wedding of one of his sons, not with regard to gifts of groomsmen sent by the father.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, some of whom brought gifts of groomsmen. </span>The Gemara responds: Emend the text of the mishna and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>it as saying: With regard to brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">to some of whom </span>gifts of groomsmen were brought. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated. </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saying: When it is collected </span>from the brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">in return, it is collected from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi says: </span>Even if the text of the mishna is not emended, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult </span>and can be reconciled with the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>in the mishna it is referring to where the father sent the gifts of groomsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">without specifyin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> which son should be ascribed credit for bringing the gifts. <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">specified </span>that the credit for the gifts of groomsmen should be ascribed to a specific son, who receives gifts in return, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">his father sent gifts of groomsmen on his, </span>i.e., the son’s, behalf, then <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is reciprocated, it is reciprocated to him, </span>i.e., to that specific son. If <span class="gemarra-regular">his father sent gifts of groomsmen without specification, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is reciprocated, it is reciprocated to the middle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: Here </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose married brother died childless [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The son who brought the gifts of groomsmen died childless, his brother entered into levirate marriage with the widow, and the gifts of groomsmen were reciprocated at the wedding of the <span class="it-text">yavam</span>. Although the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> inherits the property of his brother, since the reciprocal gifts were not extant when his brother died, they do not belong solely to him; rather, they are divided among the brothers. This is because the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take </span>in inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property the deceased already <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed.</span>
The Gemara asks: Is it possible to conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>from Shmuel’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that the other </span>side, i.e., a friend who had received gifts of groomsmen from the deceased, is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">repay </span>the gifts of groomsmen he received from the deceased? Why should this be so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him say: Give me my groomsma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I will rejoice with him. </span>Since the one who gave him the gifts is deceased, he is not obligated to reciprocate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Pesaḥim</span> 3:1) with regard to similar circumstances: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are accustomed to return the betrothal </span>money when the betrothed man or woman dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it; in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are accustomed not to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Ukva says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>in which case one follows the local custom. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the man <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Since <span class="gemarra-regular">she can say: </span>

Daf 145a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, </span>i.e., it is not my fault that we are not getting married, she is not required to return the betrothal money. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, let him say: Give me my groomsman and I will rejoice with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: With what are we dealing here? </span>Shmuel’s statement is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the original recipient, in reciprocation, <span class="gemarra-regular">rejoiced with </span>the brother who brought the gifts of groomsmen during the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven days of </span>the wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast, but did not suffice to repay him before </span>the brother <span class="gemarra-regular">died. </span>Since it was the usual practice to send the gifts of groomsmen after the groomsman rejoiced with the betrothed man for seven days, he is obligated to reciprocate the gifts of groomsmen, and the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> cannot claim them for himself.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that Shmuel’s statement that a betrothed woman can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, is</span> a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betrothed a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and then he divorces her or dies, if she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">collects two hundred </span>dinars in payment of her marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow, </span>she collects <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return the betrothal </span>money when the betrothed man or woman died, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it. In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed not to return the betrothal </span>money, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>it. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Natan. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually they said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it; in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed not to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>it.
The Gemara clarifies: The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rabbi Natan. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>concerns the validity of the claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betrothed a woman </span>and then the betrothal is terminated, if she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">collects two hundred </span>dinars in payment of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow, </span>she collects <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">where he retracted, </span>i.e., he died or divorced her. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to where <span class="gemarra-regular">she died, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return </span>the betrothal money, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it; in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed not to return </span>the betrothal money, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">where she died; but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he died, they do not return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">she can say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him. </span>This is the statement of Rabbi Natan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi came to say: Actually they said: Whether he died or whether she died, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it; in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed not to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she cannot say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him.</span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">she can say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, and </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he died, everyone agrees </span>that she does not have to return the betrothal money. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she died, and here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the question of whether <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is given as a sunk </span>cost, i.e., that it is not returned even if the betrothal is not consummated, that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. Rabbi Natan holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is not given as a sunk </span>cost, and in a place where people were accustomed to return it, they return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is given as a sunk </span>cost.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it? This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not hold that the betrothal money was given as a sunk cost. The Gemara replies: This is not referring to the betrothal money, which is not returned in any event. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">presents, </span>which the betrothed man sent his betrothed following the betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to return </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>them.
The Gemara notes: The dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> just mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case where the man <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a talent </span>of silver, equivalent to six thousand dinars, if she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>in payment of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars over and above this amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow </span>she collects <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>over and above this amount. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: A virgin collects two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and a widow one hundred dinars, and she returns the rest </span>of the betrothal money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. Rabbi Yosei says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he betrothed her with twenty, he gives her thirty halves; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he betrothed her with thirty, he gives her twenty halves, </span>as the Gemara will explain.
The Gemara clarifies the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If we say </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">when she died, is she entitled </span>to receive payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>perhaps the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he died, </span>in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does Rabbi Yehuda state that <span class="gemarra-regular">she returns the rest </span>of the betrothal money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him? Let her say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him. Rather, </span>perhaps the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the wife, </span>i.e., the betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">of an Israelite, who committed adultery, </span>who cannot claim that she is available to marry her betrothed, as it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse with him. The Gemara challenges: This is also difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">with what </span>circumstance is the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> dealing? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>she committed adultery <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly, is she entitled </span>to receive payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rape. </span>But in that case, she <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why should she return the betrothal money?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wife, </span>i.e., the betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">of a priest, who was rape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and is prohibited from engaging in intercourse with her betrothed. She therefore cannot claim: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, yet she is entitled to receive payment of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is given as a sunk </span>cost: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds that betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is given as a sunk </span>cost. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not given as a sunk </span>cost. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei is uncertain if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is given as a sunk </span>cost <span class="gemarra-regular">or not.</span>
The Gemara explains Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since it is uncertain whether or not she is required to return the betrothal money, <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore, </span>she returns only half the money: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he betrothed her with twent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>, which are equivalent to eighty dinars, she owes him forty dinars. Yet, if she is widowed or divorced, she is entitled to one hundred dinars in payment of her marriage contract, so he or his estate <span class="gemarra-regular">gives her thirty halves </span>of a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, which are equivalent to sixty dinars, so that she receives one hundred dinars in all. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he betrothed her with thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which are equivalent to one hundred twenty dinars, she owes him sixty dinars. Since she is entitled to one hundred dinars in payment of her marriage contract, he <span class="gemarra-regular">gives her twenty halves </span>of a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, equivalent to forty dinars.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: In every place where they were accustomed to return </span>the betrothal money, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the interpretation </span>of this statement is that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a. </span>The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest of Babylonia, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">presents are returned </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is not returned. Rav Pappa said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he died </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether she died or </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted </span>his agreement to the betrothal and divorced her, the <span class="gemarra-regular">presents are returne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is not returned. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she retracted </span>her agreement to the betrothal and requested a divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is returned.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">is not returned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes effect with her sister. </span>If the betrothal money is returned, people are likely to think that the betrothal is retroactively nullified and that the man can betroth her sister, whereas in fact the betrothal was not retroactively nullified and he cannot betroth her. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Her bill of divorce proves for her </span>that she was betrothed, so this concern is not in effect. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ashi is a mistake, since there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who heard about this, </span>i.e., the return of the betrothal money, <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not hear about that, </span>i.e., the bill of divorce.
§ The mishna teaches: If the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated after the father’s death, they are reciprocated to the middle, <span class="gemarra-regular">because gifts of groomsmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>a legal debt owed to the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">collectible in court. The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:8): <span class="gemarra-regular">Five statements were said with regard to gifts of groomsmen: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">collectible in court; and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">reciprocated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at their </span>relevant <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., at the time of the groomsman’s own wedding; <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are not subject to</span> the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">interest, </span>i.e., it is permitted to reciprocate with a gift of greater value than the original gift; 

Daf 145b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">does not abrogate them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the firstborn does not take a double </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of them.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that gifts of groomsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">are collectible in court. What is the reason </span>for this? It is that they are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a loan.</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they are not subject to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">interest. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">that in mind </span>that he gave him a larger gift. Rather, he did so on account of his joy at his friend’s wedding. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">does not abrogate them. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that one cannot read </span>the verse concerning the abrogation of debts during the occurrence of the Sabbatical Year: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall not exact </span>it of his neighbor and his brother, because the Lord’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>gifts of groomsmen. Since one cannot choose to exact the gifts until the time of one’s own wedding, they are not addressed by this verse.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the firstborn does not take a double </span>portion from them. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they constitute potential </span>inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the firstborn does not take</span> in inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: The principle with regard to </span>the reciprocation of <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts of groomsme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is: If the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">was in town </span>when his groomsman wed, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have come </span>to the wedding, and even if he did not come, he is obligated to send the gifts of groomsmen. If he was not in town, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was nearby and he <span class="gemarra-regular">heard the sound of the dru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> announcing the wedding, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have come. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was far away and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hear the sound of the drum, </span>the betrothed man <span class="gemarra-regular">should have informed him. </span>If he did not inform him, the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">has a grievance </span>against the betrothed man because he did not inform him about the wedding, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">repays </span>the gifts of groomsmen.
In this case, since he did not partake of the wedding feast, he is entitled to deduct a sum from the reciprocal gift. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And up to how much </span>can he deduct? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">members of a wedding </span>feast <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed </span>to deduct according to the following principle: If the gift of groomsmen that the reciprocal giver received was <span class="gemarra-regular">up to a dinar, </span>he now pays nothing, because what a person <span class="gemarra-regular">brings in his hand he consumes in his stomach. </span>If the gift of groomsmen was <span class="gemarra-regular">up to four </span>dinars, he now <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From that </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, each person </span>deducts <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his prominence, </span>i.e., in accordance with the outlay that would have been required to honor the reciprocal giver properly, had he participated in the wedding feast.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:9): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">served </span>as groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his friend <span class="gemarra-regular">at a public [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pumbei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> wedding, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when the groomsman himself wed, he <span class="gemarra-regular">requested </span>that his friend reciprocate <span class="gemarra-regular">by serving </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for him at a private </span>wedding, the friend <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I </span>am willing to reciprocate and <span class="gemarra-regular">serve </span>as groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at a public </span>wedding, where the rejoicing is greater, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner you served </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for me. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">served </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his friend <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he married <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">requested </span>that his friend reciprocate <span class="gemarra-regular">by serving </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for him when</span> he marries <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow, </span>the friend <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I shall serve </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>you marry <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, in the manner you served </span>as a groomsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for me.</span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “All the days of the poor are terrible; </span>and for the good-hearted it is always a feast” (Proverbs 15:15)? “All the days of the poor are terrible”; <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">master of Talmud, </span>who is wearied by the difficulty of his Talmud study. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">master of Mishna, </span>who recites the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> by rote and is not wearied thereby.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: The opposite </span>is true. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>consistent with that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them; and he that chops wood shall be warmed thereby” </span>(Ecclesiastes 10:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">“He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them”; these are the masters of Mishna. </span>They exert themselves to memorize the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>, but since one cannot reach practical conclusions from the mishna, they are comparable to one who carries a heavy load without benefiting from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">“He that chops wood shall be warmed thereby”; these are the masters of Talmud, </span>who attain the benefit of their exertions in the form of practical conclusions.
The Gemara cites other interpretations of this verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this </span>is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who has a wicked wife. “And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this </span>is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who has a good wife. Rabbi Yannai says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is delicate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">istenis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and overly sensitive, because he constantly encounters unpleasant situations. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this </span>is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is relaxed </span>and not particular with regard to his food or his surroundings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an empathetic person, </span>because he is constantly affected by the suffering in the world. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cruel person, </span>who is not pained by the suffering of others. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this </span>is referring to a person <span class="gemarra-regular">of impatient disposition.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this </span>is referring to a person <span class="gemarra-regular">of patient disposition. </span>

Daf 146a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>Is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the days of the poor are terrible? But aren’t there </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals, </span>when even the poor enjoy their meals and rest? Rather, explain this <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: A change of regimen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> causes <span class="gemarra-regular">the onset of </span>intestinal <span class="gemarra-regular">disease, </span>and as a result the poor suffer even from a change for the good.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is written in the book of ben Sira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> All the days of the poor are terrible. Ben Sira says: The nights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as well. His roof is at the lowest point of the roofs; the rain of roofs go onto his roof. His vineyard is at the height of the mountains; the soil of his vineyard goes onto other vineyards.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends presents [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sivlonot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to his father-in-law’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> following his betrothal, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sent there </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten thousand dinars and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">ate there a groom’s feast even </span>worth the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar, </span>if for any reason the marriage is not effected, the presents <span class="gemarra-regular">are not collected </span>in return by the formerly betrothed man. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not eat a groom’s feast there, </span>the presents <span class="gemarra-regular">are collected, </span>as they were not an unconditional gift. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">sent many </span><span class="gemarra-regular">present</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with the stipulation <span class="gemarra-regular">that they return with her to her husband’s house, </span>i.e., to his own house, after the wedding, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are collected </span>if the marriage is not effected. If he sent <span class="gemarra-regular">a few presents for her to use while in her father’s house, they are not collected.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if the betrothed man ate food worth even a single dinar at his father-in-law’s house, the presents are not returned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he ate food worth <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna with reference to the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar? </span>The Gemara answers: It is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a dinar, and </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar </span>is that it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches the matter in the manner in which it </span>typically occurs, and one does not usually eat less than that. Rava therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the formulation of the mishna is precise; the mishna is not referring to the value of less than a dinar.
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna with regard to a betrothed man who <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>at his father-in-law’s house. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he drank </span>there? <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna with regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>the betrothed, ate there. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">his agent </span>ate there? <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna with regard to a case where the betrothed man ate <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>at his father-in-law’s house. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if his father-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him </span>a feast to his home?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof concerning one these matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving one man who sent to his father-in-law’s house one hundred wagons </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">of jars of wine and of jars of oil, and </span>one hundred wagons full <span class="gemarra-regular">of silver vessels, and </span>one hundred wagons full <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold vessels, and </span>one hundred wagons full <span class="gemarra-regular">of garments of fine wool [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">milat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And he rode </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>state of <span class="gemarra-regular">joy and went and stood by the entrance to his father-in-law’s house. And they brought out </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">a cup of hot </span>drink <span class="gemarra-regular">and he drank </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died.</span>
The question arose as to whether the presents must be returned to the betrothed’s heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Aḥa Sar HaBir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Sages in Usha, and they said: Presents that are typically consume</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not collected, and </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not typically consumed are collected. </span>One can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this incident that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the betrothed only <span class="gemarra-regular">drank, </span>some of the presents cannot be reclaimed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can you learn from this </span>incident that the presents cannot be claimed <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he ate or drank <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar, </span>since a cup of hot drink is not worth a dinar? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Who shall say to us that they did not grind a pearl worth one thousand dinars and serve it to him to drink? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can you learn from this </span>incident that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent </span>the feast <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>the presents cannot be claimed, as he drank at the entrance and did not enter inside? The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps the entire entrance of his father-in-law’s house is considered as his father-in-law’s house.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Rava states that if the betrothed man ate less than the value of a dinar at his father-in-law’s house, and the marriage is not effected, he can collect the presents he sent. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he must divide </span>the value of the presents, and claim only part of the value, in proportion to the amount he ate? And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement of </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the presents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Does one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are </span>extant <span class="gemarra-regular">they are returned to him, </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">they were enhanced under his ownership? Or perhaps, since </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are lost or stolen, </span>the betrothed woman’s family is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to repay him, </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">they were enhanced under her ownership. </span>The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">presents that are typically consumed, but were not consumed? </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Aḥa Sar HaBira raised this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Sages at Usha, and they said: Presents that are typically consumed are not collected, and </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not typically consumed are collected. What, is it not </span>referring to presents that are typically consumed <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they were not consumed? </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the mishna is referring to presents <span class="gemarra-regular">that were </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed.</span>
The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If he sent a <span class="gemarra-regular">few presents for her to use while she is in her father’s house, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not collected. </span>This indicates that they cannot be collected in any event, irrespective of whether they were used or not. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava interpreted </span>the mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a snood or hairnet, </span>which are insignificant items that the betrothed man sends without any intention of later collecting them.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving one man who sent new wine, and new oil, and new linen garments to his father-in-law’s house at the </span>time of <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is this incident <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us the importance, </span>i.e., the greatness, <span class="gemarra-regular">of Eretz Yisrael, </span>where there is new wine, oil, and linen already available at the time of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that it teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the betrothed man <span class="gemarra-regular">claims </span>that he sent these items at the time of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">his claim is </span>a plausible <span class="gemarra-regular">claim, </span>and there is no reason to question it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving one man who was told </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife, </span>i.e., his betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">was one whose sense of smell was impaired</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he followed her into a ruin, </span>carrying a date with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">to check her </span>to see if she could correctly identify the smell. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: I smell </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">scent of radish in the Galilee. </span>

Daf 146b

<span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: Who will give us of the dates of Jericho that I shall eat them, </span>hinting that she smelled the date he had brought with him. <span class="gemarra-regular">The ruin collapsed upon her and she died. The Sages said: Since he went into </span>the ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">after her only to check her </span>sense of smell, and not for the purpose of consummating their marriage, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she dies, he does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the marriage was not effected, and a man does not inherit from his betrothed.
§ The mishna teaches: If he sent <span class="gemarra-regular">a few presents for her to use while in her father’s house, </span>they are not collected. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin the Elder was sitting before Rav Papp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he was sitting and saying: Whether she died, or whether he died, </span>or whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted</span> his agreement to the betrothal and divorced her, the <span class="gemarra-regular">presents return </span>to the betrothed man or his heirs, but <span class="gemarra-regular">food and drink do not return. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she retracted </span>her agreement to the betrothal and requested a divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">even a bundle of vegetables returns </span>to the betrothed man. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>When the presents are returned, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises for </span>the betrothed woman’s family the sum that they must repay for any meat he gave her, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to a reduced </span>assessment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and not according to the price the betrothed man paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>less is the <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced </span>assessment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to one-third </span>less than he paid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">death-be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to others, and he reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, his gift stands </span>even if he subsequently recovers. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reserve </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he recovered, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift does not stand, </span>as the gift was conditional upon his death, since is it evident that he did not intend to leave himself without means of support.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught that we follow </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">assessing </span>a person’s intentions, even when he did not expressly state them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: This is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 5:9): In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one’s son went overseas and he heard that his son died, and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and wrote </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to another, and then his son came </span>back, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift </span>to the other people <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: His gift is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, as had he known that his son </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">alive he would not have written </span>a document granting <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: This is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, as it is taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 65b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">would say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was taken out in a colla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to be executed <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">should write and give </span>her the document. Although he did not explicitly say the word give, this is understood to have been his intention, to release her from the necessity to perform levirate marriage or <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">They then said </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even to one who sets sail and one who departs with a caravan </span>to a far-off place. A bill of divorce is given to his wife under these circumstances even if her husband said just: Write. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is dangerously il</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> who gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman does not interpret </span>the mishna as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Shezuri? </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Naḥman holds that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, as he said: Write </span>a bill of divorce, thereby partially stating his intention to divorce her, whereas in the case of the mishna here, he did not express his intention at all. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet does not interpret </span>the mishna as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">An assessment </span>of a person’s intentions <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">prove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different, </span>and it is possible that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya does not apply this principle where the person’s intentions are less evident.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught that which the Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 4:15): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was ill and bedridden, and </span>those present <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: To whom </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">your property </span>be given? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to them: </span>

Daf 147a

Previously, I <span class="gemarra-regular">thought that I had a son. Now </span>that I have been informed <span class="gemarra-regular">that I do not have a son, my property </span>shall be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so. </span>Or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">was ill and bedridden, and </span>those present <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: To whom </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">his property </span>be given? And <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>Previously, I <span class="gemarra-regular">thought that my wife was pregnant. Now </span>that I have been informed <span class="gemarra-regular">that my wife is not pregnant, my property </span>shall be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so. And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became known, </span>in either of those cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he had a son or that his wife was pregnant, his gift is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he clearly indicated that he bestowed the gift on that recipient only because he thought he had no heir.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that this is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>as the case where he said: I <span class="gemarra-regular">thought</span> that I had a son, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, </span>since he stated the reason for his actions.
Since the difference between the cases is obvious, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who asked it, why did he ask it? </span>The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that when the bedridden man mentioned that he does not have a son, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is mentioning it </span>only as an expression of <span class="gemarra-regular">his sorrow, </span>since the matter of the disposal of his estate brings it to mind, but he is not mentioning this as the reason for the gift, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the reference to his son indicates that had he known that he had a son, he would not have given his property to others.
§ Unlike the gifts of a healthy person, the gifts of a person on his deathbed do not require a formal act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: From where</span> is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gift of a person on his deathbed is by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is stated </span>in the passage delineating the laws of inheritance: “If a man dies, and he does not have a son, <span class="gemarra-regular">then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter” </span>(Numbers 27:8). The term “you shall cause…to pass” is superfluous, as the verse could have stated: His inheritance shall go to his daughter. One can therefore derive from this term that <span class="gemarra-regular">you have another </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">causing </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">to pass </span>to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is comparable to this </span>case of inheritance, which does not require an act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is this </span>case? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the gift of a person on his deathbed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>“And if he has no daughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers” </span>(Numbers 27:9). The verse could have stated: His inheritance shall go to his brothers, as inheritance is transferred by itself, without any intervention. One can therefore derive from the term “you shall give” that <span class="gemarra-regular">you have another </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">giving that is comparable to this </span>case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is this </span>case? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the gift of a person on his deathbed.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, what is the reason </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall cause…to pass”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires that </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">for that </span>which is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: With regard to all of </span>the heirs, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">giving was stated </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>with regard to the daughter, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">causing to pass was stated. </span>One can derive from this that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>heir <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">cause </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance to pass from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe except </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, since her son and her husband inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her, </span>and they may be of a different tribe.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then you shall give”? </span>The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>usage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of the verse, </span>and one cannot derive anything from this term.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Menashya bar Yirmeya says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came to him, and said to him: So says the Lord: Instruct your household, for you will die, and you will not live” </span>(II Kings 20:1). This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">merely by </span>issuing <span class="gemarra-regular">an instruction, </span>a person on his deathbed can transfer ownership of his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Yeḥezkel says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, </span>and he arose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and went to his home, to his city; and he instructed his household, and strangled himself” </span>(II Samuel 17:23). This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">merely by </span>issuing <span class="gemarra-regular">an instruction, </span>a person on his deathbed can transfer ownership of his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>Before his death, when he saw that Absalom’s rebellion against King David had failed, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ahithophel instructe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his sons </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">three matters:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Do not be </span>participants <span class="gemarra-regular">in a dispute. And do not rebel against the kingship of the house of David</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a clear </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">sow wheat, </span>as it is a sign that the wheat crop will thrive. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: It was stated </span>that the wheat crop will thrive if <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cloudy </span>day, not if it is a clear day. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov: </span>According to both opinions, <span class="gemarra-regular">a clear </span>day does <span class="gemarra-regular">not literally </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">a clear</span> day, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloudy </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">literally </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloudy </span>day. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even </span>if the day is <span class="gemarra-regular">cloudy but a north wind is blowing </span>the clouds away, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a clear </span>day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: We teach this </span>matter of signs concerning crops <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, as Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says: </span>At <span class="gemarra-regular">the conclusion of the final day of the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone looked upon the smoke </span>rising from <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrangement </span>of wood on the altar. If the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">inclined toward </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">nort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> due to a south wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">the poor </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">glad and the homeowners </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">sad, because </span>this was a sign that the <span class="gemarra-regular">year’s rainfall </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">plentiful, and </span>although the rain would produce an abundant crop, the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">decay </span>due to the humidity. The humidity would make it difficult to store the abundant harvest, forcing the homeowners to sell the produce quickly at a lower price.
If the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">inclined toward </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">south </span>due to a north wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">the poor </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">sad and the homeowners </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">glad, because </span>this indicated that the <span class="gemarra-regular">year’s rainfall </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">sparse and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>would be meager and would <span class="gemarra-regular">store </span>well. If the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">inclined toward </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">east </span>due to a west wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">glad, </span>because this indicated that there would be sufficient rainfall to ensure a substantial crop, and at the same time, the produce would store well. If the smoke inclined <span class="gemarra-regular">toward </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">west </span>due to an east wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">sad, </span>because the east wind does not bring rain, and this indicated that there would be a drought.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An east </span>wind is <span class="gemarra-regular">always beneficial, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a west </span>wind is <span class="gemarra-regular">always harmful. A north wind </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the wheat when it has reached one-third </span>of its growth <span class="gemarra-regular">and harmful to the olives when they are blossoming. And a south wind is harmful to the wheat when it has reached one-third </span>of its growth <span class="gemarra-regular">and beneficial to the olives when they are blossoming.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef says, and some say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra </span>who says this, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span> who says this: The following is <span class="gemarra-regular">your mnemonic </span>to remember which wind is beneficial to which crop: The <span class="gemarra-regular">Table </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the north </span>of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Candelabrum </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the south. This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">increases its own, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">increases its own, </span>i.e., the Table, upon which the shewbread made from wheat is placed, is in the north, and the north wind is beneficial to the wheat. The Candelabrum, which is lit with olive oil, is in the south, and the south wind is beneficial to the olives. In any event, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradicts the statement of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi with regard to the effect of the western and eastern winds.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This, </span>the east wind, is <span class="gemarra-regular">for us, </span>in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the west wind, is <span class="gemarra-regular">for them, </span>in Eretz Yisrael. In Babylonia the east wind is beneficial, because water is plentiful there, and the dry east wind does not harm the crops. In Eretz Yisrael the east wind is harmful, because water is scarce, and the east wind ruins the crops, whereas the west wind brings the necessary rain.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a clear </span>day, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a good sign for the entire year. Rav Zevid said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this first day of Rosh HaShana, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">warm, the entire year </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">warm, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">cold, the entire year </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">cold. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What difference is there </span>whether one knows this or not? 

Daf 147b

The Gemara answers: The difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the prayer of the High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who would pray on Yom Kippur for beneficial weather, and this knowledge enabled him to formulate his prayers accordingly.
The Gemara resumes the discussion with regard to the gifts of a person on his deathbed: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed </span>does not require an act of acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">is merely by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>he see that his will is not being carried out and <span class="gemarra-regular">he lose control of his mind </span>due to his grief, exacerbating his physical state.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rav Naḥman </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say: Even though Shmuel says </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a promissory note to another and then forgives </span>the debt, the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">is forgive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and the note is nullified, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heir </span>of the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">forgive </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel concedes that if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">as the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his heir <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>the debt?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the gift of a person on his deathbed is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law </span>without an act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>the debt, as the debt was acquired by another. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why </span>is the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">unable to forgive </span>the debt? The Gemara replies: Rav Naḥman maintains that although this gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>nevertheless, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">made it </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the force <span class="gemarra-regular">of Torah law.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so shall reside in this house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so shall eat </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit of this palm tree, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything, </span>as one cannot give that which is not tangible, such as the right to use property, or the right to consume fruit that has not yet grown. His statement is ineffective <span class="gemarra-regular">until he says: Give this house to so-and-so and he shall reside there, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give this palm tree to so-and-so and he shall eat its fruit.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this to say that Rav Naḥman maintains </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that can be </span>conferred as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">by a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> healthy person </span>with an act of acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">can be </span>conferred as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">by a person on his deathbed </span>by means of verbal instruction, but a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be </span>conferred as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">by a healthy person cannot be </span>conferred as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">by a person on his deathbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Consequently, a person on his deathbed cannot transfer ownership of an intangible right, just as a healthy person cannot do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rava say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>

Daf 148a

With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: Give </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>owed <span class="gemarra-regular">to me to so-and-s</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> as a gift, the <span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>owned to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by so-and-so. And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">despite </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that this does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as one cannot transfer a loan to a third party without a promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>In this case the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of transferring loans differs with regard to a person on his deathbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">since an heir inherits </span>loans without a promissory note, and the Sages accorded the gift of a person on his deathbed the halakhic status of an inheritance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: A loan </span>without a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">can be </span>conferred as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">by a healthy person. And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says, as Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to one who said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession, give it to so-and-so, </span>if this was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">three of the </span>parties, the third party <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the money without an act of acquisition and without the need for witnesses.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to one who gave <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and its fruit to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Did </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">reserve the place of the fruit </span>on the tree for the second person in order to give him a tangible object, and therefore the second person acquires the fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">he not reserve </span>it, and the second person does not acquire the fruit? Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that giving the palm tree to one person and giving the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">to another is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>the place of the fruit unless this is explicitly stipulated, then if he reserves the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>stating that the tree is given to another <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fruit, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that giving the <span class="gemarra-regular">palm tree to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and its fruit to another is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving the place of the fruit </span>for the second person, if he gave the <span class="gemarra-regular">palm tree to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and reserved the fruit for himself, </span>he also <span class="gemarra-regular">reserved the place of the fruit </span>for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this distinction? The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>that one reserves <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to himself, he reserves generously, </span>and therefore he reserves for himself not only the fruit itself, but also the place of the fruit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: We learned </span>the aforementioned statement of Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> concerning a different matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a house to another and says to him: </span>I am selling the house <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that the upper story [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyota</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> remains <span class="gemarra-regular">mine, the upper story </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">his. </span>

Daf 148b

<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages with regard to the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: If one sold <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>i.e., a lower story, <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>stated that the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story </span>will be sold <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>additional rights for the second person apart from the upper story, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If you say </span>that in a case where one sells his <span class="gemarra-regular">house to one and </span>the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story to one, </span>his stipulation <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>rights for the second person, there is another dilemma. If one sold a house <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story, </span>reserving the upper story for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this considered reserving additional rights for himself?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that where one sells the <span class="gemarra-regular">house to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story to one </span>other person, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>rights for the second person, if one sold a house <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>additional rights for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Zevid, who says </span>that the reason the seller reserves additional rights is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to extend projections from </span>the upper story into the space of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may extend </span>them.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Evidently, since he reserved </span>the upper <span class="gemarra-regular">story, he also reserved the place of the projections. Here too, </span>with regard to the one who gave a palm tree to another and reserved the fruit for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he said </span>that the tree is given to another <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fruit, he reserved the place of the fruit </span>for himself as well.
§ The mishna (146b) states that if a person on his deathbed granted all of his property to others but reserved for himself any amount of land, his gift is valid even if he recovers. If he did not reserve for himself any amount of land, his gift is not valid if he recovers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to others, </span>the manner in which he divided his property <span class="gemarra-regular">is examined. If </span>it appears <span class="gemarra-regular">that he was </span>intending <span class="gemarra-regular">to divide </span>his entire estate among various recipients, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he dies, all </span>the recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>their gifts. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">recovers, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">retract all </span>of the gifts, in accordance with the ruling of the mishna.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it appears <span class="gemarra-regular">that he was reconsidering </span>the matter, initially intending to give away only a portion of his property, and then reconsidering and distributing the rest, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he dies, all </span>of the recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>their gifts. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he recovers, he can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">retract only the last </span>gift, as the previous gifts were given with the intent to reserve part of the property for himself, and they are valid even if he recovers. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>he was not reconsidering; rather, he initially intended to transfer ownership of all of his property, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he was considering </span>to whom to give each portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and then giving </span>it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The usual </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">of a person on his deathbed is to consider </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">carefully </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">confer </span>his gifts. Therefore, if he pauses to consider in the interim, it appears that he did not initially intend to transfer ownership of his entire estate.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his </span>generally known <span class="gemarra-regular">property to others, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">recovered, he cannot retract </span>it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he has propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in another provinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that he reserved for himself, in which case the gift is valid even if he recovered.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, which teaches: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reserve </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, </span>and he recovered, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift is not valid, how can you find these </span>circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: All my property </span>is given to so-and-so, in which case he clearly reserved nothing for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where our presumption is that he does not have </span>property elsewhere.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">is a partial retraction </span>of the gift considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a retraction of the entire </span>gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a retraction of the entire gift? The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then he partially retracted his gift and gave <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to the second </span>recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second acquired </span>his gift, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the first did not acquire </span>anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>and the reason that the first recipient does not acquire anything is that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift?
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">recovered. </span>The first gift was invalidated, because he left nothing for himself, whereas the second gift remained valid, since he gave only part of his property. Had he died, the first recipient would have received the remainder, as the giver retracted only part of the first gift, which he gave to the second recipient.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to understand the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If he gave <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first </span>recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then he gave <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to the second </span>recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>his gift, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the second did not acquire </span>anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">recovered, due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>the gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he died, both of them should acquire </span>their gifts.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: And even </span>if the first clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he recovered, </span>one can prove that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partial retraction is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a retraction of the entire </span>gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that at least the second </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the gift, as the giver reserved part of his property for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partial retraction is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a retraction of the entire </span>gift, the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as one who was dividing </span>all of his property between the two recipients, <span class="gemarra-regular">and neither of them should acquire </span>their gifts.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partial retraction is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> retraction of the entire </span>gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">You find </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that is stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">died and </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he recovered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You find </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that is stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last claus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he recovered.</span>
§ A series of <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemmas were raised before </span>the Sages: If a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to the Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">recovered, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">that concerns consecrated </span>property the assumption is that he <span class="gemarra-regular">resolves to transfer </span>the property unconditionally, and therefore the consecration is valid even if he recovers? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that concerns himself </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not resolve to transfer </span>the property unconditionally.
Furthermore, if a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">declared all of his property ownerless, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>declaring his property ownerless is <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">the poor as well as the rich, </span>it involves the potential mitzva of providing for the poor, and therefore the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he resolves to transfer </span>the property, i.e., declare it ownerless, unconditionally? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that concerns himself he does not resolve to transfer </span>the property unconditionally.

The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">another version </span>of this series of dilemmas: If a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated all of his property </span>to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he <span class="gemarra-regular">declared all of his property ownerless, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

These dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>If one says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall take </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: </span>So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall gain possession </span>of my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: </span>So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall take possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: He shall acquire </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">are terms </span>that denote the bestowal <span class="gemarra-regular">of gifts. </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If one says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall receive as an inheritance, or:</span> So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> these are <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>valid terms denoting inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him.

A series of <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemmas were raised before </span>the Sages: 

Daf 149a

If a person on his deathbed says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall benefit from </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is he <span class="gemarra-regular">saying that all </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be a gift? Or perhaps </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">shall derive some benefit from </span>the property. If he says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be seen in </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand in </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he says: So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">shall rely on </span>my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">sold all of his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: If he recovers, he cannot retract </span>the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">times, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: If he recovers, he can retract </span>the sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>these statements <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree. This </span>statement, that he can retract the sale, applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the dinars </span>he received as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">extant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement, that he cannot retract the sale, applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he paid his debt with </span>those dinars.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that he owed money to a certain person, where it was possible that he did not actually owe him money, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does his admission qualify as the gift of a person on his deathbed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Issur the convert had twelve thousand dinars </span>deposited in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of Rava. Rav Mari</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Issur’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son, whose conception was not in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity </span>of the Jewish people, i.e., he was conceived before his father converted, <span class="gemarra-regular">but his birth was in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity </span>of the Jewish people, i.e., he was born after his father converted, <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a study hall </span>elsewhere when his father was on his deathbed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>reasoned that he would acquire possession of the deposit for himself, as he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: How can Rav Mari acquire these dinars? If </span>he attempts to acquire the money <span class="gemarra-regular">as inheritance, he is not fit to inheri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from Issur. Since he was conceived before his father converted, he is therefore not halakhically considered his son. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he attempts to acquire it <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, the Sages equated </span>the halakhic status of the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">can be </span>acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">as inheritance, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it can </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be </span>acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">as inheritance, it cannot be </span>acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he attempts to acquire the dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling </span>them, which is a formal act of acquisition, he will not be able to do this, as the dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">are not with him.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>he attempts to acquire them <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of symbolic <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a pro forma act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an article, <span class="gemarra-regular">money cannot be acquired by </span>means of symbolic <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>he attempts to acquire them <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means of </span>the acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Issur <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">land. If </span>he attempts to acquire them by means of verbal instruction made by his father <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>parties, i.e., the giver, the recipient, and the bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he sends for me, </span>the bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">I shall not go,</span> as without the presence of the bailee he cannot transfer ownership of the money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, objected to this: Why </span>is Rav Mari unable to acquire the money? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">let Issur admi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that these dinars are </span>owned <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Mari, and he shall transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to Rav Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">admission? In the meantime, </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>stating that the dinars belonged to Rav Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged from Issur’s house. Rava became angry, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: They are teaching people </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">claim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and causing me loss. </span>In any event, this incident proves that the admission of a person on his deathbed is a valid means of transferring ownership. 

Daf 149b

§ The mishna teaches (146b): If a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, his gift stands </span>even if he subsequently recovers. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is meant by the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>This means <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for his livelihood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he reserved this land for himself, one can assume that he wished to transfer the rest of his property in any event. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says: </span>Even if he reserved for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for his livelihood, </span>his gift is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: How meticulou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">the halakhic statements of the elders </span>Rav Yehuda and Rav Yirmeya. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">land, what </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that he must have reserved enough for his livelihood? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he recovers </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on that </span>land for his livelihood. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property as well, if he recovers </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on it </span>for his livelihood.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef objects to </span>Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is meticulous </span>about these statements? The statement of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>the gift is valid even if he reserved for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property </span>is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that he must leave himself <span class="gemarra-regular">land. </span>The statement of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that he must leave himself an amount <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">for his livelihood </span>is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that his gift is valid if he reserved for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">And anywhere that </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">land is taught, </span>does it mean <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically land? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes, </span>i.e., gives via a document, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">has been emancipated, </span>but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been emancipated, </span>as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: He always </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman </span>regardless of the wording of the document, even if the owner reserved land for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it says </span>in the document: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of my property is given to so-and-so my slave, except for one ten-thousandth of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as in that case it is possible that the master meant to include the slave in the portion that he is not giving away. Consequently, the slave is not emancipated. 

Daf 150a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Dimi bar Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed movable property </span>to be considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property for oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the emancipation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that a slave is not emancipated when his owner gives him all of his other property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they did not deem movable property </span>that one withheld from his sons and earmarked for his wife to be considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one granted all of his property to his sons but reserved any amount of land for his wife, she forfeits her marriage contract. By not protesting the gift, she has conceded that she will collect her marriage contract only from the land he reserved for her. Nevertheless, if he reserved only movable property for his wife, she does not forfeit her marriage contract. Rabbi Elazar’s ruling with regard to a slave indicates that the expression: Reserves any amount of land, does not necessarily exclude movable property.
Rav Yosef replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to the slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">by right </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>but it should have taught the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to all property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">former clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to land, the mishna mentions land in the subsequent clause as well. The Gemara cites the former clause (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:6): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land is obligated in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in first fruits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>if the debtor possesses any amount of land the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> so that his loans will not be canceled in the seventh year; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can acquire property that does not serve as a guarantee </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with it by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by a deed, or by taking possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of it. Rav Yosef concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to this </span>reason, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
Abaye raises an objection to Rav Yosef’s statement that the term any amount should be understood literally: <span class="gemarra-regular">And anywhere that </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any amount, is taught, </span>does the amount <span class="gemarra-regular">not have a measure? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 135a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says: </span>When shearing <span class="gemarra-regular">five sheep, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared </span>wool of each sheep, with the wool weighing <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one hundred and fifty dinars, renders the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span>the mitzva to give <span class="gemarra-regular">the first sheared </span>wool to the priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Five sheep, </span>each of whose <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared </span>wool yields wool weighing <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And we say: And how much </span>is signified by the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any amount? Rav says: </span>A total weight of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and half </span>of one hundred dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>the one hundred and fifty dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">are divided </span>equally <span class="gemarra-regular">between the five </span>sheep. This indicates that the term any amount can denote a certain minimal amount.
Rav Yosef replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to the first sheared wool, <span class="gemarra-regular">by right </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount. But since the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas, <span class="gemarra-regular">states a large measure, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">also state </span>that they require <span class="gemarra-regular">a small measure, </span>and therefore they <span class="gemarra-regular">call </span>this measure <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount. </span>But with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, the term any amount should be understood literally.
§ It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I give <span class="gemarra-regular">my movable propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then that person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his utensils, excluding </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one said: I give <span class="gemarra-regular">all my movable propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to so-and-so, </span>then that person acquires <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley, and he acquires even the upper millstone, </span>since it is occasionally removed from its place. He acquires all the property that is not land or houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the lower millstone, </span>which is never moved. If he said: I give <span class="gemarra-regular">everything that can be moved </span>to so-and-so, that person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires even the lower millstone, </span>as it is possible to move it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is the legal status of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, or </span>is his status <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (68a): A landowner <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells the city has sold </span>with it the <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">ditches and caves, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bathhouses, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the olive presses and the irrigated fields, but not the movable property. But when </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the buyer: I am selling <span class="gemarra-regular">it and everything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is in it, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were animals or </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves in </span>the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are all sold. </span>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not sold in the first </span>case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, why is he not sold </span>with the city?
Rav Ashi replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you say? Do you maintain that his legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property? </span>If there is no difference in legal status between Canaanite slaves and movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the reason that the mishna emphasizes in the second case that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the Canaanite slaves are sold? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say </span>to explain this? One must explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property that moves </span>by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from movable property that does not move </span>by itself, and therefore one might have thought that although the sale includes movable property, Canaanite slaves are not included in the sale. In the same manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, land that moves is different from land that does not move. </span>Therefore, the legal status of Canaanite slaves cannot be proved from this mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes, </span>i.e., gives via a document, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">has been emancipated, </span>but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been emancipated, </span>as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: He always </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman </span>regardless of the wording of the document, even if the owner reserved land for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it says </span>in the document: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of my property is given to so-and-so my slave, except for one ten-thousandth of it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Dimi bar Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed movable property </span>to be considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property for oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a slave, </span>so that the slave is not emancipated when the owner gives him all of his other property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they did not deem movable property </span>that one withheld from his sons and earmarked for his wife to be considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract. And Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What is the reason </span>for this? Rav Naḥman explained: A Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, and </span>reserving <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property is</span> considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving with regard to movable property. But a woman’s marriage contract is </span>a document concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>since the payment of the marriage contract is collected from land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>reserving <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property is not </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving with regard to land. </span>Rav Naḥman states that a Canaanite slave is considered movable property. 

Daf 150b

Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Ravina: The reason the slave is not emancipated if the master reserved part of the property for himself is not that the slave is included in the property that the owner reserved for himself. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> as being <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a bill </span>of manumission <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">sever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the bond between the slave and the master.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>types of gifts to which specific <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply, but the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> do not apply <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">their property</span> to another without reserving anything for themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are as follows: </span>The gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a gift to one’s Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>a gift to one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife, </span>a gift to one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, </span>and the gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who shelters </span>her property from her prospective husband by transferring her property to another before her marriage. In this latter case the Sages instituted that if her husband dies or divorces her she can reclaim the property.
The Gemara explains each of these cases: In the case of a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna (146b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to others, and he reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, his gift stands </span>even if he subsequently recovers. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reserve </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, </span>and he recovered, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift does not stand, </span>as the gift was conditional upon his death, since evidently he did not intend to leave himself without means of support if he survived.
In the case of a gift to one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">has been emancipated, </span>but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been emancipated, </span>as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well.
In the case of a gift to one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: One who writes </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renders her only a steward </span>of his property, i.e., he intends only to place her in charge of the property and she does not acquire it. According to Rav Naḥman, this applies only if he did not reserve any part of the property for himself.
In the case of a gift to one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:7): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his sons, and he writes </span>in the deed that he grants <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land to his wife, she forfeits </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he reserves any amount of land for himself, his wife does not forfeit payment of her marriage contract.
In the case of a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who shelters </span>her property from her intended husband, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Master says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who </span>wishes to <span class="gemarra-regular">shelter </span>her property from her prospective husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must write </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">her property </span>to another. If she reserves for herself any amount of property, she cannot reclaim the property if she is widowed or divorced.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to all of these </span>cases, reserving <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property, <span class="gemarra-regular">except with regard to </span>a woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract. </span>If one grants all of his property to his sons except for any amount of land, which he gives to his wife, and he reserves for himself only movable property, his wife forfeits payment of her marriage contract, as nothing remains in the husband’s possession from which she is entitled to collect payment. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Sages instituted </span>that the lien on the marriage contract is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on land,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not institute </span>that the marriage contract can be collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from movable property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property that is </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">written in the marriage contract </span>as property from which the debt may be collected <span class="gemarra-regular">and is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">extant, </span>if the husband reserves this property for himself, this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">reserving </span>of property, and his wife does not forfeit payment of her marriage contract.
§ If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: My property </span>shall go <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> anything that is referred to as property is included in the gift. A Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is called property, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 3:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes, </span>i.e., gives via a document, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">has been emancipated. Land is called property, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that serves as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantee, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or by taking possession </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">A cloak, </span>as well as other garments and movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is called property, as we learned </span>in that same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not serve as a guarantee, </span>i.e., movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired only by pulling.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Money [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is called property, as we learned </span>in that same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with property that serves as a guarantee by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed, or by taking possession </span>of it. Money is among the types of property that can be acquired by means of the acquisition of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>is evident from <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">involving Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">had twelve thousand dinars </span>loaned to the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">Bei Ḥozai. </span>Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred </span>ownership of the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa, </span>who was traveling to Bei Ḥozai, <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>transferring ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">the threshold of his house, </span>so that Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa could collect the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>back with the money, Rav Pappa was so pleased that he <span class="gemarra-regular">went out as far as Tavakh to meet him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A deed is called property, as Rabba bar Yitzḥak says: There are two </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds </span>with regard to the acquisition of land. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire this field on behalf of so-and-so and write the deed for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> as proof of the sale, the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">can retract the deed but he cannot retract the </span>transfer of ownership of the <span class="gemarra-regular">field </span>once the other party has taken possession of it. If one said: Acquire this field on behalf of so-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that you write the deed for him, </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">can retract both the deed and </span>the transfer of <span class="gemarra-regular">the field, </span>as he stipulated that the acquisition of the field is dependent on the writing of the deed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: There are three </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds. Two </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">those that we stated </span>above, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the seller wrote the deed in advance </span>and kept it until the buyer would come and pay him. The Gemara adds parenthetically: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that we learned </span>in a mishna (167b): 

Daf 151a

A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">write a deed </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for the seller </span>of property at the seller’s request, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the buyer is not with him </span>when he presents his request, as the deed obligates only the seller. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">once this </span>one, the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">has taken possession of the land, the deed is acquired</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wherever it is. And this is </span>as it is stated in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that we learned </span>(<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the property that serves as a guarantee by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed, or by taking possession </span>of it. One can learn from this that a deed is included in the term: Property that does not serve as a guarantee.
<span class="gemarra-regular">An animal is called property, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shekalim</span> 12a): In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrated his property, and on </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">there were animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit to </span>be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar, male </span>animals are sacrificed as <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings, and female </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are sold for the purpose of </span>being sacrificed as <span class="gemarra-regular">peace-offerings. Birds are called property, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shekalim</span> 12a): In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrated his property,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">there were items that were fit to </span>be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar, </span>e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">wines, oils, and birds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Eliezer says: They are sold for the needs of that kind of item, i.e., to individuals who will use them as such.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Phylacteries are called property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 23b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates his property, </span>the value of his <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries is assessed for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and he redeems them by paying their value to the Temple treasury. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it considered property or not? Does one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is not sold, as it is prohibited to sell </span>a Torah scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">property? Or perhaps </span>one says that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it may be sold </span>in order to enable one <span class="gemarra-regular">to study Torah or to marry a woman, it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">property. </span>The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic</span> for the series of incidents stated below: <span class="gemarra-regular">Zutra, the mother, of Amram, from two sisters, Rav Tovi, and Rav Dimi and Rav Yosef.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The mother of Rav Zutra bar Toviyya wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her property to Rav Zutra bar Toviyya, </span>explaining that she was doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">because she wanted to get married to Rav Zevid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and she did not want him to acquire her property. <span class="gemarra-regular">She married </span>Rav Zevid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he divorced her. She came before Rav Beivai bar Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to claim her property from her son. Rav Beivai <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>She transferred her property <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>she wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to get married, and she married. </span>Since her intentions were fulfilled, even though she subsequently was divorced, the gift is a valid gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to </span>Rav Beivai: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because you come from </span>a line of <span class="gemarra-regular">truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mula’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from the house of the High Priest Eli, whose descendants were condemned to premature death (see I Samuel 2:31), that <span class="gemarra-regular">you say truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mulyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and unsound <span class="gemarra-regular">matters? Even according to the one who says </span>that the deed of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who shelters </span>her property from her intended husband <span class="gemarra-regular">effects acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the woman cannot reclaim the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where she did not reveal her intentions </span>in transferring ownership of her property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, she revealed her intentions that </span>she transferred the property <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>she wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to marry; and she married, but was divorced. </span>Therefore, since she is no longer married, she can reclaim the property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The mother of Rami bar Ḥama wrote </span>a deed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the evening </span>granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her property to Rami bar Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In the morning</span> of the following day, <span class="gemarra-regular">she wrote </span>a deed granting her property <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva bar Ḥama. Rami bar Ḥama came before Rav Sheshet, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">established him </span>as the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property, </span>as the deed transferring the property to him preceded the gift to his brother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva bar Ḥama came before Rav Naḥman, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">established him </span>as the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet came before Rav Naḥman </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master established Rav Ukva bar Ḥama </span>as the owner of the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because she retracted </span>her gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t she die? </span>Since the gift of a person on his deathbed is considered valid, Rami bar Ḥama already acquired the property in the evening. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Sheshet: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he could retract </span>his gift <span class="gemarra-regular">if he were to recover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if he transferred ownership of all of his property, even if he does not recover, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can retract his gift.</span>
Rav Sheshet responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that Shmuel said </span>that he can retract his gift if he wants to retain the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>but if he wants to retract his gift in order to give it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, did he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he can do so? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Sheshet: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel explicitly said </span>that he can retract his gift <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>in order to retain the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself and </span>to grant it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The mother of Rav Amram the Piou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a bundle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meloga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes. When she was dying, she said: Let </span>these promissory notes <span class="gemarra-regular">be for Amram, my son. His brothers came before Rav Naḥman. They said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>Rav Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">did not pul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> the bundle of documents, and since an act of acquisition was not performed he did not acquire them. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>An act of acquisition was not required, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of a person on his deathbed is considered as written and as </span>though the documents were <span class="gemarra-regular">delivere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the recipient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The sister of Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wrote </span>a deed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning </span>granting <span class="gemarra-regular">her property to Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattana. In the evening </span>another brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥadvoi bar Rav Mattana, came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cried to her. </span>Rav Aḥadvoi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: Now </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>that you gave your property to Rav Tovi because this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rav Tovi, is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scholar, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rav Aḥadvoi, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a Torah scholar. She wrote </span>a deed granting the property <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span>Rav Tovi <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Tovi: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he could retract </span>his gift <span class="gemarra-regular">if he were to recover, </span>even if he does not recover, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can retract his gift,</span> and therefore the property belongs to Rav Aḥadvoi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The sister of Rav Dimi bar Yosef had a tract of </span>land in <span class="gemarra-regular">an orchard. Whenever she was sick </span>and thought that she was dying, <span class="gemarra-regular">she would transfer </span>ownership of the orchard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Dimi, 

Daf 151b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and when she recovered she would retract </span>her gift. On <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion she was sick. She sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>my property. <span class="gemarra-regular">He sent </span>a message back to her: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not want </span>to come. <span class="gemarra-regular">She sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>my property in <span class="gemarra-regular">any manner that you want. He went and reserved </span>for her part of the orchard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the rest of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> with an act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">When she recovered she retracted </span>the gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">She came before Rav Naḥman </span>to reclaim it. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>to court. Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come. He said: What </span>reason is there for <span class="gemarra-regular">me to come? Didn’t </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">reserve </span>part of the property for her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the rest of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from her </span>with an act of acquisition? Therefore, the acquisition is complete. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you do not come, I will strike you with a thorn [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">besileva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that does not draw blood, </span>i.e., I will excommunicate you.
Inquiring into the matter, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the witnesses: How did the act </span>of transferring the property take place? The witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">she said: Woe, that woman is dying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">!</span> Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: If so, this is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who issues directives </span>with regard to his property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And one who issues directives due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death can retract </span>his gift even if he did not transfer all of his property, as he evidently granted the gift only because he expected to die.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift of a person on his deathbed </span>that includes only <span class="gemarra-regular">a part </span>of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava in the name of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, who said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Naḥman: This </span>type of gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in some respects <span class="gemarra-regular">like the gift of a healthy person, and </span>in other respects <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed. It is like the gift of a healthy person, as, if he recovers he cannot retract </span>it, as stated in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed, as it does not require </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rather, it is acquired by means of verbal instruction alone.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did I not say to you: Do not hang empty pitchers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bukei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon Rav Naḥman, </span>i.e., do not attribute incorrect statements to him? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>A gift of a person on his deathbed that includes only a part of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">is like the gift of a healthy person and requires </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition. </span>If an act of acquisition is not performed, the acquisition of the gift is not effective even if the owner dies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from the mishna (146b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">he reserved </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">land, his gift stands. What, is it not </span>referring even to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was not acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition? <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition. Rava asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the last clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reserve </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount of land, </span>and he recovered, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift does not stand. And if </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does his gift not stand?</span>
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to others </span>without reserving anything for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was acquired from his possession </span>by means of an act of acquisition, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he recovers, he can retract </span>his gift. The reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known that he was issuing directives </span>with regard to his property <span class="gemarra-regular">only due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mesharshiyya raised an objection to Rava: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving the mother of the sons of Rokhel, who was sick, and she said: My brooch [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keveinati</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be given to my daughter, and it is </span>valued <span class="gemarra-regular">at twelve hundred dinars. And </span>this woman subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">upheld her statement </span>even though the gift included only a part of her property and an act of acquisition was not performed. Rava replied: That incident is different, as the case <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who issues directives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection to Rava </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 13a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: Give this bill of divorce to my wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or: </span>Give <span class="gemarra-regular">this bill of manumission to my slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, one should not give it after </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>But if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does give </span>the recipient the money <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>This indicates that a gift of a person on his deathbed that includes only a part of his property does not require an act of acquisition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>can one learn <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">was not acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition? This is learned from the fact that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was juxtaposed to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a bill of divorce, indicating that this case is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a bill of divorce. Just as a bill of divorce is not subject to </span>the standard <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of an act of acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of the gift of one hundred dinars, the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">was not acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition. Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, too, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who issues directives </span>with regard to his property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>The gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who issues directives </span>with regard to his property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death generally requires </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And when it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span> that an act of acquisition is not required, the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who divides all of his property </span>between different recipients, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">accorded </span>the gift the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift of a person on his deathbed.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift of a person on his deathbed </span>that includes only <span class="gemarra-regular">a part </span>of his property <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition; </span>otherwise it is invalid <span class="gemarra-regular">even though he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>and the gift is inherited by his heirs instead. The gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who issues directives </span>with regard to his property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his expectation of his imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death does not require </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition. And this </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">recovered, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">retract </span>his gift <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it was acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition. 

Daf 152a

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to a deed pertaining to the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed in which </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>that an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>was also performed. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall of Rav they say in the name of Rav: </span>The person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">to mount two steeds, </span>i.e., he strengthened the validity of his gift in two different ways. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: I do not know what I should rule with regard to this </span>gift, as it may not be a valid gift.
The Gemara explains: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall of Rav they say in the name of Rav </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he caused him to mount two steeds. </span>On the one hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a healthy person, </span>but on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed. It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a healthy person, as, if he recovers he cannot retract </span>the gift, because an act of acquisition was performed. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed, as, if he said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>should be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">loan </span>owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by so-and-so, </span>whereas a healthy person cannot transfer his right to collect a debt except in the presence of all three parties.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: I do not know what I should rule with regard to this </span>gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps</span> the fact that an act of acquisition was performed indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he resolved to transfer it </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">only with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deed. </span>The gift of a person on his deathbed takes effect only after he dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a deed is not </span>effective if it is delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the owner.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction between </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, and between </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Ravin sent in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: You should know that Rabbi Elazar sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Diaspora, </span>i.e., Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of our teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rav: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: Write </span>a deed <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to so-and-so, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>before the deed was written, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not written and given </span>to that person. The reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he resolved to transfer </span>the gift to him <span class="gemarra-regular">only with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">deed, and a deed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>effective if it is delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the deed <span class="gemarra-regular">is written and given </span>to the recipient.
The Gemara concludes: The first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as it is apparently contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>and the first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel is difficult, </span>as it is apparently contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel.</span>
The Gemara replies: The apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span> and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement, that the gift is valid, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was acquired from </span>the person on his deathbed by means of an act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>other statement is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">was not acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition, but only by verbal instruction, and therefore the deed is not written after his death. The apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel</span> and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as Shmuel’s statement that the deed is written after his death is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver was clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancing the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>of the recipient by providing him with a deed, and he was not making the gift contingent upon the delivery of a deed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was sitting behind Rava, and Rava was sitting before Rav Naḥman, </span>and Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the fact that an act of acquisition was performed indicates that the person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved to transfer </span>ownership of the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">only with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">deed, and </span>therefore the gift is invalid, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deed is not </span>effective if it is delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property to others, even though </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an act of acquisition, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he recovers he can retract </span>his gift? 

Daf 152b

The reason for Shmuel’s ruling is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known that </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">only due to </span>his expectation of imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>This ruling indicates that if the giver does not recover, the recipient acquires the gift, and the performance of an act of acquisition does not indicate that the giver intended to transfer the property only after his death. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">indicated </span>the answer <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a gesture of <span class="gemarra-regular">his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">arose </span>from his place, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What did he indicate to you </span>with that gesture? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>He indicated that the statement of Rav Yehuda is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the giver was clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancing the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>of the recipient by requiring an act of acquisition to be performed in addition to bestowing the gift.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is considered </span>an act of acquisition that <span class="gemarra-regular">enhances the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>of the recipient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>An act of acquisition is clearly intended only to reinforce the legal power of the recipient when, for example, the following phrase is written in the deed: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we, </span>the witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition <span class="gemarra-regular">in addition to this gift. </span>This indicates that the act of acquisition was not performed in order to effect the actual acquisition.
§ It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a deed of transfer granting his property <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a deed granting the same property <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>individual, i.e., a second recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the case discussed by Rav Dimi. <span class="gemarra-regular">As when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>A later <span class="gemarra-regular">will [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dayetikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullifies </span>an earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree with regard to a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a deed of transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">conferred possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>individual, and then he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a deed of transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">and conferred possession </span>of the same property <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span>second individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the gift.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the gift. Since an additional act of conferring possession of the property was performed, the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a healthy person, </span>which cannot be retracted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the gift because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed, </span>which can be retracted.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>Rav and Shmuel already <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about this </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">once? With regard to </span>a deed pertaining to the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed in which </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>that an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>was also performed, Rav maintained that the gift cannot be retracted, whereas Shmuel maintained that the acquisition was not effective. Why is it necessary to record another disagreement with regard to the same principle?
The Gemara replies: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to cite both cases. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because if it were stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that </span>case, where an act of acquisition was recorded in the deed, one might say that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the gift cannot be retracted, <span class="gemarra-regular">because an act of acquisition was </span>performed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where an act of acquisition was not </span>performed, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he concedes to Shmuel. And if it was stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>case, where he conferred possession of the property on the recipient through a deed alone, one might say that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says </span>that he can retract the gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in the other </span>case, where an act of acquisition was recorded in the deed, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to Rav </span>that he cannot retract it. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to cite both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In Sura they taught </span>the statements of Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">that way, </span>as stated above. <span class="gemarra-regular">In Pumbedita they taught </span>their statements <span class="gemarra-regular">like this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says: </span>After the death of Rav, the following question <span class="gemarra-regular">was sent from the study hall of Rav to Shmuel: Let our teacher teach us: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who wrote </span>a deed of transfer granting <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to others, and they performed an act of acquisition, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">sent to them </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>is performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing </span>can effect a retraction of the gift. 

Daf 153a

Rav’s disciples <span class="gemarra-regular">understood from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only when the person on his deathbed wishes to retract his gift and transfer it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another. But </span>if he recovers and wishes to retract the gift and retain it <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>Shmuel’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>apply. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to them: When Rav Huna came from Kufrei, he explained </span>that Shmuel’s statement applies <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>to retaining the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself and </span>to transferring it <span class="gemarra-regular">to others.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person on his deathbed who wrote a deed of transfer granting his property to another, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it was acquired from him </span>by means of an act of acquisition. He subsequently recovered and wanted to retract the gift, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he came before Rav Huna. </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What can I do for you? </span>You cannot retract the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">as you did not transfer </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that people </span>on their deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>ownership of gifts, and you enhanced the legal power of the recipient by performing an act of acquisition.
§ The Gemara relates: There was a deed pertaining to <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain gift </span>of a person on his deathbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which it was written </span>that the gift is given both <span class="gemarra-regular">in life and in death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed, </span>and if he recovers he can retract it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a healthy person, </span>and he cannot retract it.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a person on his deathbed. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written in </span>the deed that the gift is given <span class="gemarra-regular">in death. </span>This means that the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to him </span>that the gift should take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death, and that which is written </span>in the deed, that the gift is given <span class="gemarra-regular">in life, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>an auspicious <span class="gemarra-regular">omen, </span>expressing hope <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">will live.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: It is like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift of a healthy person. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written in </span>the deed that the gift is given <span class="gemarra-regular">in life. </span>This means that the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that the gift takes effect <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">life, </span>i.e., immediately. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which he wrote, </span>that the gift is given <span class="gemarra-regular">in death, is like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who says: From now and for evermore, </span>i.e., that the gift is not retractable. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And if it was written in </span>the deed that the gift is given <span class="gemarra-regular">during life </span>and in death, the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the gift and it cannot be retracted, as this term indicates that the gift takes effect while the giver still lives.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: </span>Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav? </span>Ameimar replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that with regard to the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">During life, Rav concede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that the giver intends for the gift to take effect immediately, Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that since the giver also mentioned death, he intended the gift as the gift of a person on his deathbed and he can retract it.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person who wrote in the deed that the gift is given in life and in death. When he recovered he wanted to retract the gift. He <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman in Neharde’a. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him to </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba in Shum Tamya. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in explanation of his actions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>Neharde’a, <span class="gemarra-regular">is the place of Shmuel. </span>Consequently, Shmuel’s rulings should be followed, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">how can we act in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>woman who wrote in the deed that the gift is given during life and in death. She <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. Rava acted with regard to her </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his halakhic </span>ruling, and he ruled that she cannot retract the gift. She did not accept the ruling, and <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>constantly <span class="gemarra-regular">troubled him,</span> saying that he had not judged her case properly.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Pappa, his scribe, son of Rav Ḥanan: Go, write for her </span>a ruling in her favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and write in </span>the ruling the phrase: He may <span class="gemarra-regular">hire </span>replacements <span class="gemarra-regular">at their </span>expense, <span class="gemarra-regular">or deceive them </span>to get them to return to work. This is a phrase from the mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 75b) that discusses the ruling in the case of one who hired laborers to perform a task that cannot be delayed, and they quit. Rava intended this phrase to indicate to the court that the ruling was merely a ruse in order to persuade the woman to leave. The woman understood the ruse. <span class="gemarra-regular">She said: May his ship sink; you are deceiving me. Rava had his clothes immersed in water </span>so that the curse should be fulfilled in this alternative manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">but even so he was not saved from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sinking </span>of his ship.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write in </span>the deed that he was <span class="gemarra-regular">on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deathbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he then recovered and wished to retract the gift, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: I was on my deathbed, </span>and since I recovered, I can retract the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">say: You were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">healthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the gift cannot be retracted, the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">must bring proof that he was on his deathbed </span>in order to retract the gift. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>and since the property is in the possession of the giver, the recipients must bring proof that they have the right to receive it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was a deed pertaining to <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain gift </span>of a person on his deathbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which it was written </span>that the gift was bestowed <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">was sick and lying in his bed, but </span>the continuation of the standard formula: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from his sickness he departed to his </span>eternal <span class="gemarra-regular">home, was not written in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The giver’s heirs claimed that although he was ill when he wrote the deed, he later recovered, and his gift is not valid. 

Daf 153b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: He is dead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his grave proves </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>died. It may therefore be assumed that he did not recover from his sickness, and his gift remains valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: And now, if </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ship </span>that sank, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fate of <span class="gemarra-regular">most of </span>the passengers of sunken ships is <span class="gemarra-regular">to perish, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stringencies of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">living and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stringencies of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dead are applied to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> due to the uncertainty as to whether they are alive or dead, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sick people, where </span>the fate of <span class="gemarra-regular">most sick people </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>return to <span class="gemarra-regular">life, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that one should assume that he recovered from the illness and his gift is invalid?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabba? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a case where one who gave his property to others claims that since he was on his deathbed at the time he can retract the gifts, and the recipients claim that he was healthy and cannot retract it, <span class="gemarra-regular">who removes </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from whose possession? </span>The giver <span class="gemarra-regular">can remove </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the recipients’ <span class="gemarra-regular">possession without proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the property was previously established to be in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">can remove </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the giver’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession only with proof. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: </span>The presumption is that the current situation reflects the situation at the time the gift was bestowed. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he is </span>currently <span class="gemarra-regular">healthy, </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">is upon him to bring proof that he was on his deathbed </span>when he gave his property to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is </span>currently <span class="gemarra-regular">on his deathbed, </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">is upon </span>the recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring proof that he was healthy </span>then.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: And with regard to </span>a case of uncertain <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> depends <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Teharot</span> 6:7): The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that a case where it is uncertain if something or someone became impure in the public domain, the item or person is deemed pure. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an expanse of fields, in the summer, </span>when many people pass through the fields, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, but </span>it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and if one is uncertain as to whether he was rendered impure there, he is deemed pure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the rainy season, </span>when not many people pass through the fields, an expanse of fields is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this, </span>Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> ritual impurity. Therefore, if one is uncertain whether he was rendered impure there, he is deemed impure. If one does not know whether the day he entered the expanse of fields was considered part of the summer or the rainy season, and he is uncertain whether he was rendered impure there, Rabbi Ya’akov maintains that he retains the status of purity that he held before entering the fields. According to Rabbi Natan, it is presumed that he entered the fields during the same season in which he came to ask whether he was rendered impure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>disagrees with Rabbi Elazar and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: They taught </span>the ruling of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the rainy season has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">passed over </span>the fields after the possibility arose that the fields contained impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the rainy season has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">passed over </span>the fields, it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this, </span>Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to that, </span>ritual impurity. Even though the one who passed through the fields came to ask about his status in the summer, when the fields should be considered the public domain, he is nevertheless deemed impure even according to Rabbi Natan, and there is no parallel dispute with regard to uncertain ritual impurity.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>and since the property is in the possession of the giver, the recipients must bring proof that they have the right to receive it. 

Daf 154a

The Gemara asks: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>that the recipients must bring, <span class="gemarra-regular">in what </span>manner is it brought? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>who testify that the giver was healthy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the deed, </span>i.e., the recipients are required only to ascertain that the signatures of the witnesses on the deed are authentic in order to prove that it is not forged.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses. </span>He maintains that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute of Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Natan </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (153b).
The Gemara notes <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device that indicates which tannaitic opinions are correlated: <span class="gemarra-italic">Manniaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which represents the letters <span class="it-text">mem</span>, <span class="it-text">nun</span>, <span class="it-text">yod</span>, <span class="it-text">ḥet</span>, stands for Meir, Natan, Ya’akov, and the Rabbis [<span class="it-text">ḥakhamim</span>]. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who says that the giver must bring proof that he was on his deathbed, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, </span>who maintains that one presumes that the current situation reflects the situation at the time the gift was bestowed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>who say that the recipients must bring proof that the giver was healthy, hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the deed. </span>The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna maintain that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>whether when there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">must ratify i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in court in order to collect payment. The same ruling would apply to a case where the person on his deathbed admits that he wrote the deed granting the gift. They explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir holds </span>that when there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">need not ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment, and in this case the giver cannot invalidate the deed by claiming that he was on his deathbed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis hold </span>that even when there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">must ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to this </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">once? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that at the time they signed the document they were not fit to bear witness, their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible to invalidate </span>the document; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: </span>Their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to state both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">because if </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case with regard to witnesses who disqualified their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, </span>one might think that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages say </span>that their testimony is accepted only <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses is powerfu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they can impair </span>the validity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">document, but here, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>the giver, <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>admitted that he wrote the deed but it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in his </span>power to impair the validity of the deed, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that his claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accepted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, with regard to a debtor who admits that he wrote a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, </span>one might think that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that the giver cannot invalidate the deed only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to that </span>case, where the witnesses ratified their signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to the Rabbis </span>that witnesses can invalidate the deed. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to state the dispute in both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba also says: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>that the recipients must present, it is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who testify that the giver was healthy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that in all </span>deeds of gift the following formulation <span class="gemarra-regular">is written: When he was walking on his feet in the marketplace, </span>which indicates that the gift was the gift of a healthy person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in this </span>deed this <span class="gemarra-regular">was not written, </span>therefore one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the deed that the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">was on his deathbed, </span>that is not correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>one could say that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that in all </span>deeds concerning the gifts of a person on his deathbed the following <span class="gemarra-regular">is written: When he was sick and lying in his bed, and in this </span>deed this <span class="gemarra-regular">was not written, </span>therefore one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the deed that the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">was healthy.</span>
Rabba replied: Since one <span class="gemarra-regular">can say this and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">can say that, </span>nothing can be concluded from the formulation of the deed. Therefore, due to the uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">establish the property in the possession of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>last known <span class="gemarra-regular">owner.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this dispute with regard to the statement of the Rabbis is also the subject <span class="gemarra-regular">of a dispute </span>between other <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the deed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident in Bnei Brak involving one who sold </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that he had inherited, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he died, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family came and contested </span>the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: He was a mino</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the time of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>and therefore the sale was not valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they came and asked Rabbi Akiva: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted to exhume the corpse in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine it </span>and ascertain whether or not the heir was a minor at the time of his death? Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">you to disgrace him</span> for the sake of a monetary claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, signs </span>indicating puberty <span class="gemarra-regular">are likely to chang</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after death, </span>and therefore nothing can be proved by exhuming the body. 

Daf 154b

Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to my </span>explanation of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">that I say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>must be presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>I can explain the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the buyers: Bring witnesses, and they did not find </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that they came and said to him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine him? But according to you, that you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by ratification of the deed, why do they </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine him? Let them ratify their deed and they shall be established </span>as owners <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the property.</span>
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the property stood in the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family and the buyers came and contested </span>their possession of the property? Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the property stood in the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family came and contested </span>the sale. Since they claimed that the deed was invalid, they could not prove their claim by ratifying the deed, but only by bringing witnesses or examining the body.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This, too, stands to reason, as </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the claimants: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are not permitted to disgrace him, and they were silent. Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family were contesting </span>the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">they were silent, </span>as they accepted that they should not disgrace their relative. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyers were contesting </span>the claim of the relatives, <span class="gemarra-regular">why were they silent? They should have said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">We gave him money, </span>and if our right to the property cannot be proven without disgracing him, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him be disgraced.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is due to that</span> reason, i.e., this claim they could have said, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>conclusive <span class="gemarra-regular">argument. This is what </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: One </span>reason to prohibit exhuming the body is <span class="gemarra-regular">that you are not permitted to disgrace him. And furthermore, if you should say: He took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money; let him be disgraced, </span>in any event nothing can be proved by exhuming the body, as <span class="gemarra-regular">signs </span>indicating puberty <span class="gemarra-regular">are likely to change after death.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish aske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught in the Mishna of bar Kappara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> There was one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was continually enjoying </span>the profits from <span class="gemarra-regular">a field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it was the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption that it was his, and someone contested his </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: It is mine. And that </span>person, who was profiting from the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">produced a deed, </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: </span>It is mine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as you sold </span>this field <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, or: </span>It is mine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as you gave me </span>this field <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift. If </span>the one who protested his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I do not recognize that deed </span>as one that I have <span class="gemarra-regular">ever </span>written, <span class="gemarra-regular">the deed </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">be ratified through its signatures.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the one who protested his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This is a document of appeasement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shtar </span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">assim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a document written only so that the holder should appear wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a document of trust</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which means <span class="gemarra-regular">that I sold </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>and provided you with the deed, trusting you to provide payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">you did not give me </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>the sale is void, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are witnesses, follow </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, and if not, follow the deed.</span>
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish concludes: According to your explanation, the Rabbis maintain that even if the deed is ratified the claimant cannot take possession of the property without bringing witnesses. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that when there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not required </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis?</span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is not so. <span class="gemarra-regular">As I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that in the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not required to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t they disagree, as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that they were not fit to bear witness when they signed the deed, their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible to invalidate </span>the document; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: </span>Their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible.</span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses is powerful and they impair </span>the validity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">deed, </span>which they admit to have written, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>the giver, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it in his </span>power to impair the validity of a deed that he admits to have written? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated in your name </span>with regard to the aforementioned incident in Bnei Brak: The <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family contested </span>the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">correctly, </span>even though they admitted that the deed was authentic? This means that the claimant is required to ratify the deed. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in my name by Rabbi <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> my disciple, but <span class="gemarra-regular">I never said that statement.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says: If Rabbi Yoḥanan denies </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar, his disciple, will </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan also <span class="gemarra-regular">deny that </span>which he said to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai, his teacher? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yannai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>When there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not required to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ratify it </span>in court in order to collect the payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said to </span>Rabbi Yannai: <span class="gemarra-regular">My teacher, is this not </span>the case discussed in <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna, </span>which states to the contrary: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant? </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes: The <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>mentioned in this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is nothing other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the deed. </span>This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, the recipient is required to ratify the deed. If so, why does he state that everyone agrees that the recipient is not required to ratify the deed?
Rabbi Zeira explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, the statement of our teacher, </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef, appears </span>to be correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">as our teacher </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The opinions here should be reversed. <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught by bar Kappara, according to which the deed does not require ratification, <span class="gemarra-regular">is the statement of the Rabbis. But Rabbi Meir says </span>that when there is a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that in this case, the recipient is not required to ratify the deed? Rabbi Yoḥanan means that this is the statement of the Rabbis, and a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis that </span>is disputed only <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Meir is </span>tantamount to <span class="gemarra-regular">a statement </span>accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">by all.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn the opposite </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant? </span>This means that the recipient is required to ratify the deed. The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the opinions in the mishna. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that they were not fit to bear witness, their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">not deemed credible to invalidate </span>the document; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: </span>Their testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible. </span>This indicates that according to the Rabbis the document requires ratification. The Gemara answers: Here too, <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>the opinions.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>with regard to the proof that the recipient is required to bring, that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>is presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who testify that the giver was healthy, and not by ratifying the deed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the recipient is required to prove his claim only by ratifying the deed, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish maintains that the recipient is required to bring witnesses. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that we should <span class="gemarra-regular">also reverse the objection </span>that Rabbi Yoḥanan raised to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish previously, and say that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised the objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>that is unnecessary. 

Daf 155a

<span class="gemarra-regular">This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Granted, according to my </span>explanation of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">that I say </span>that presenting <span class="gemarra-regular">proof through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification of the deed </span>is sufficient in order to enable the recipient to claim the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>with regard to the incident in Bnei Brak <span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that the buyers take possession of the propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> by ratifying the deed. It is therefore possible that the buyers held the property, and the relatives were claiming it from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to you, that you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>must be presented <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, how can you find </span>circumstances in <span class="gemarra-regular">which the buyers take possession of the property, </span>since they have no proof?
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">I concede to you with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>the deceased’s <span class="gemarra-regular">family contested </span>the legality of the buyers’ claim <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">contesting </span>the legality of that claim <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>taken into consideration, since they are contesting the deed held by the buyers. It is therefore possible for the buyers to take possession of the property, as in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">what do </span>the relatives <span class="gemarra-regular">say? </span>They say that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">was a minor. </span>But there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses do not sign the document unless </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">has become an adult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In the mishna, by contrast, there is no presumption that counters the giver’s claim that he was on his deathbed. The recipient is therefore required to bring proof that the giver was healthy.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that there was a dispute with regard to the following matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">From when, </span>i.e., from what age, <span class="gemarra-regular">can a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sell his </span>deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>From the time he is <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen years old, and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: From </span>the time he is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty years old. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises an objection </span>from the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident in Bnei Brak involving one who sold </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s property, </span>which he had inherited, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he died, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family came and contested </span>the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: He was a minor at the time of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>and therefore the sale was not valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they came and asked Rabbi Akiva: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted to exhume the corpse in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine it </span>and ascertain whether or not the heir was a minor at the time of his death? Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">you to disgrace him </span>for the sake of a monetary claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, signs </span>indicating puberty <span class="gemarra-regular">are likely to change after death, </span>and therefore nothing can be proved by exhuming the body. Rabbi Zeira explains the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that the heir can sell the property once he is <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen years old, </span>

Daf 155b

<span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that they came and said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine </span>the corpse? <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that he can sell the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the time he is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if they examine him, what of it? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 47b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a twenty-</span>year<span class="gemarra-regular">-old </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not develop two </span>pubic <span class="gemarra-regular">hairs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> proof must be brought that he is twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>and then he is no longer considered a minor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he is the sexually underdeveloped man, </span>who is excluded from the mitzva of levirate marriage. Therefore, if his married brother dies childless, <span class="gemarra-regular">he neither performs </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor enters into levirate marriag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with his widow. Since a twenty-year-old is considered an adult even if he has not developed signs of puberty, there is no reason to examine the body.
The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: And </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">where he developed the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man? </span>Otherwise, a twenty-year-old who has not developed two pubic hairs is still considered a minor. The examination of the deceased could therefore be effective to see if he has other signs of being sexually underdeveloped. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also precise, as it teaches: And he is the sexually underdeveloped man. </span>The usage of the definitive article indicates that the mishna is referring to one who is clearly a sexually underdeveloped man. The Gemara affirms: One can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that the mishna is speaking of one who developed the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he did not develop the signs of a sexually</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> underdeveloped man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until when </span>is he considered a minor if he does not develop two pubic hairs? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: He is considered a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">until most of his years </span>have elapsed, i.e., until he is thirty-five years old. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the case of one who had not developed pubic hair <span class="gemarra-regular">would come before Rabbi Ḥiyya, </span>he would offer the following advice: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the person was <span class="gemarra-regular">thin, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>those appearing in court: Cause him <span class="gemarra-regular">to become fat, and if he was fat, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to them: </span>Cause him <span class="gemarra-regular">to become thin. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because these signs </span>indicating puberty <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes develop due to </span>excessive <span class="gemarra-regular">thinness, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes they develop due to corpulence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">During </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>i.e., the year, when a minor comes of age with regard to selling his deceased father’s property, i.e., during his eighteenth or twentieth year, is this year considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span> that he comes of age <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time? </span>Does one come of age at the beginning or end of that year? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: During </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he does not come of age until the year has elapsed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Sheila </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: During </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>and he is considered as having come of age during that year.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person who was <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>i.e., the year, when one comes of age <span class="gemarra-regular">who went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>his father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property, and </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the litigants: <span class="gemarra-regular">He did not do anything, </span>and the sale is not valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who observed </span>Rava’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed </span>that he ruled in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he maintained <span class="gemarra-regular">that during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>when he comes of age is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time. But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. </span>The reason for Rava’s ruling was that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">observed excessive mental incompetence in </span>the behavior of that individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was emancipating his slaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since Rava saw that he was mentally incompetent, he invalidated the sale.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel bar Menashya sent </span>an inquiry <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava: Let our teacher instruct us: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a girl </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">fourteen years and one day ol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">understand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the nature of business </span>negotiations, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Can she sell property that she inherited from her father? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a reply <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Giddel bar Menashya: <span class="gemarra-regular">If she understands the nature of business </span>negotiations <span class="gemarra-regular">her purchase is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">purchas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and her sale is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>Giddel <span class="gemarra-regular">could have sent </span>this question <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rava with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy. </span>Why did he not do so? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The incident that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took place, took place in this way. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But he could have sent </span>this question <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rava with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a girl </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve years and one day old, </span>at which age a girl reaches her majority. Why did he not do so? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The incident that took place, took place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in this way.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference, as </span>it was inferred from the following incident. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person who was <span class="gemarra-regular">under twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>and understood business negotiations <span class="gemarra-regular">who went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sold his father’s property, in accordance with </span>the ruling that Rava sent to <span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel bar Menashya, </span>and the case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. </span>The seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">relatives said to </span>the one who sold the property: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go eat dates and throw </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">pits into Rava’s house, </span>in order to prove to Rava that their relative was not mentally competent. <span class="gemarra-regular">He did so. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: His sale </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When they were writing for him a writ </span>containing the decision, <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyers said to </span>the seller, in order to prove that he was mentally competent: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to Rava: The scroll of Esther, </span>which is a large scroll, is bought <span class="gemarra-regular">for a dinar. </span>Why then does <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>short <span class="gemarra-regular">writ </span>containing <span class="gemarra-regular">Master’s </span>ruling also cost <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar, </span>which was the scribe’s fee? The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rava. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: His sale </span>is a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. The </span>boy’s <span class="gemarra-regular">relatives said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">The buyers taught him </span>to say that. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>Even so, when <span class="gemarra-regular">they explain </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">to him he understands. Since, when they explain </span>a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">to him he understands, he knows </span>what he is doing. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he acted </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, throwing the pits into Rava’s house, was because of <span class="gemarra-regular">excessive impudence that was in him, </span>not mental incompetence.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: And with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>of one who is not old enough to sell property that he inherits from his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">his testimony </span>is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony. Mar Zutra said: We said </span>that his testimony is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to movable property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not with regard to land.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is movable property different </span>from land? It is different <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>with regard to movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. But if that is so, </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 59a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A purchase </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">by young children </span>is a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a sale </span>made by them is a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. </span>These <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> transactions involving <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property. </span>Is it possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that also </span>in the case of young children <span class="gemarra-regular">their testimony </span>is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony? </span>Isn’t it an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that minors are disqualified from bearing witness? Mar Zutra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">I require </span>the witnesses to be men, as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then the two men shall stand”</span> (Deuteronomy 19:17), which is interpreted as referring to witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this requirement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fulfilled in the case of young children.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar says: </span>With regard to one who is not old enough to sell property that he inherits from his father, if he gave a gift from the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">his gift </span>is a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: Now, if </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a sale, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he receives money, you say </span>that the Sages instituted an ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> authorized to sell, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he reduce </span>the price of the property and deplete his father’s estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift </span>he is not authorized to give a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">as nothing at all comes into his </span>possession in exchange. Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: 

Daf 156a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, </span>that the money he receives in exchange for the property is a reason one could consider his sale valid, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">worth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> five </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">for six </span>dinars, would <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale also be </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the Sages maintain that a child’s inclination </span>is to be <span class="gemarra-regular">attracted to money. And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale, </span>there may be <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>that there are potential buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">who rattle the dinars </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>in order to tempt him to sell, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he will go and sell all of his father’s property. </span>That is why the Sages ruled that all of his sales are not valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a gift, if he did not </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from </span>the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not give him a gift. The Sages </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Let the gift </span>of an orphan <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">gift, so </span>that people <span class="gemarra-regular">will perform </span>beneficial <span class="gemarra-regular">matters for </span>the orphans, as the orphan can reciprocate by giving gifts.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>Children who have reached the age of majority, i.e., a boy who is thirteen years old and a girl who is twelve years old, <span class="gemarra-regular">are examined </span>for signs indicating puberty if it is necessary to determine their adulthood <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce, for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>for the purpose of stating a girl’s <span class="gemarra-regular">refusa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> to remain married. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to sell from the property that </span>one inherited from <span class="gemarra-regular">his father, </span>the seller must be older, and one cannot sell this property <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">is twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But once I examined </span>the boy <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal, why do I </span>need to examine him again <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce? </span>The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate marriag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of a minor, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 45a): A boy who is <span class="gemarra-regular">nine years and one day old who engaged in intercours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his brother’s widow, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired her </span>as his wife by means of engaging in the act of intercourse. Although a minor cannot betroth a woman under ordinary circumstances, in the case of levirate marriage the act of intercourse of a nine-year-old with his <span class="it-text">yevama</span> effects acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he cannot give </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce until he reaches his majority. </span>It is therefore necessary to examine him at the time of the divorce.
The Gemara explains why it is necessary to mention examining a boy <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> This is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of that which Rabbi Yosei </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “Man,” </span>i.e., an adult man, <span class="gemarra-regular">is written in the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">passage </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>, as the verse states: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">But a woman, whether </span>she is <span class="gemarra-regular">an adult or a minor, </span>can be released by <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>, as the verse does not indicate her age. To counter this, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that a woman is juxtaposed to a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in this passage, indicating that the <span class="it-text">yevama</span> must also have reached adulthood, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei.</span>
The Gemara explains why it is necessary to mention examining a person <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of stating her <span class="gemarra-regular">refusal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of that which Rabbi Yehuda </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that a girl whose mother or brother married her off while she was a minor can nullify her marriage by refusing to remain married, and she can state this refusal <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>she reaches complete maturity, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the area covered by <span class="gemarra-regular">black </span>pubic hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater </span>than the skin of the genital area. Rav Naḥman therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>and once a girl has developed two pubic hairs she cannot state her refusal.
Rav Naḥman states: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to sell from the property that </span>one inherited from <span class="gemarra-regular">his father, </span>the seller must be older, and he cannot sell the property <span class="gemarra-regular">until he is twenty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old. </span>This is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that the seller can be <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that with regard to the age when a minor can sell property inherited from his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>i.e., during his twentieth year, is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>when it is permitted, and he cannot sell until the end of his twentieth year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the ruling that Rava sent to <span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel bar Menashe, </span>that a child who has reached his majority and understands the nature of business negotiations can sell land.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, </span>that one who is not fit to sell land is also not fit to bear witness with regard to land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar, </span>that an orphan under the age of twenty can bestow gifts from the property he inherited from his father. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says with regard to all </span>the matters that he mentioned.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who divides his property </span>between various recipients <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal </span>instruction, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>Both in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">healthy and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">dangerously </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that serves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a guarantee, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by a deed </span>of transfer, <span class="gemarra-regular">or by taking possession </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">does not serve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a guarantee, </span>i.e., movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be acquired only by pulling. </span>

Daf 156b

The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Elazar: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving the mother of the sons of Rokhel, who was sick, and </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: My brooch shall be given to my daughter, and it is </span>valued <span class="gemarra-regular">at twelve hundred dinars. And </span>this woman subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">upheld her statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This indicates that a person on his deathbed can gift property without an act of acquisition. Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>That case was different; <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother, </span>i.e., he cursed them. It is not possible to bring a proof from this incident, as these sons were wicked people. Consequently, when ruling in this matter the Sages did not act in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, but allowed the mother of the sons of Rokhel to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister without an act of acquisition having been performed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said to the Rabbis: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mero</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who was in Jerusalem, and he had a lot of movable property. And he desired to give </span>the movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">as gifts </span>to various individuals, but they could not be acquired by pulling. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There is no remedy for </span>transferring the property <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he transfers </span>the movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>transferring the ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He went and acquired one </span>plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">rocky </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to Jerusalem, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I give <span class="gemarra-regular">the north </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>this area <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And </span>I give <span class="gemarra-regular">the south </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And he died, and the Sages upheld his statement. </span>This indicates that a person on his deathbed cannot transfer property without an act of acquisition. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Eliezer: Do you bring <span class="gemarra-regular">proof from there? </span>The man <span class="gemarra-regular">of Meron was healthy </span>at the time. This was not the gift of a person on his deathbed, and it could not be acquired by verbal instruction.
§ The mishna teaches: Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>That case was different; <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was cursing them? Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: They were maintaining thorns in a vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and did not uproot them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Eliezer </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 5:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who maintains thorns in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer says: He has proscribed </span>the vineyard, rendering it forbidden due to the prohibition against diverse kinds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Only </span>growing <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter, </span>i.e., a crop, <span class="gemarra-regular">the like of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>people usually <span class="gemarra-regular">maintain, proscribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a vineyard and renders it forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>if it were <span class="gemarra-regular">saffron </span>that grew in the vineyard, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is useful </span>for seasoning and other uses, and therefore it proscribes the vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">thorns, for what are they useful? Rabbi Ḥanina said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because in Arabi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they maintain thorns in the fields for their camels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Eliezer holds that since thorns are maintained in one place, they are considered useful everywhere.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi says: </span>An act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition may be performed </span>in order to effect acquisition of property <span class="gemarra-regular">from a person on his deathbed even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even though transactions are not performed on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this, that an act of acquisition must be performed, is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to take into consideration the statement of Rabbi Elieze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that the gifts of any person on his deathbed require an act of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason for this is that if a person on his deathbed requests the performance of an act of acquisition, his request is fulfilled, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>his anxiety upon seeing that his will is not being carried out cause him to <span class="gemarra-regular">lose control of his mind </span>due to his grief, exacerbating his poor physical state.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat, the </span>verbal <span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>of a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">stands, as </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot write, </span>and the Sages instituted that he can effect the transaction verbally lest the inability to do so exacerbate his condition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>a verbal instruction does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stand if stated <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday. Rabbi Yehoshua says: With regard to Shabbat, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that his verbal instruction is sufficient, even though writing is prohibited. One can infer <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> that the same applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a weekday, </span>when writing is permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, one can acquire </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but one cannot acquire </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of an adult, </span>since he can perform the act of acquisition himself; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a minor, </span>and one may infer <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> that this also applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an adult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who is able to perform the act of acquisition himself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is ex-pressed in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>With regard to a person on his deathbed who distributes his property by verbal instruction, <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday, his statements stand, because he can write, but </span>his statement does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stand <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>because he cannot write.

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says that Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat, </span>the verbal <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of </span>a person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">stands due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he cannot write.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A house collapsed on </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon his father, or upon </span>a certain person <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon those </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he stands to inherit, </span>and it is unknown who died first.

Since it cannot be determined who died first, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: They divide </span>the property between them so that the father’s heirs receive half of his property and the son’s creditors receive the other half. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>retains <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>previous ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">status</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the last known owner of the property was the father, the property is given to the father’s heirs.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(175a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note can collect </span>the debt even <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that has been sold. If one lends money only <span class="gemarra-regular">with witnesses, he can collect </span>the debt only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel raises a dilemma: </span>If the borrower wrote in the promissory note: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>in the future shall be liened to this debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the property liened or not? The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world, you should not raise the dilemma, as </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly acquires, </span>i.e., places a lien, on the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, when should you raise the dilemma? </span>Raise it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who say: A person cannot transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 110a): If one produces a promissory note against another, and the borrower produced a bill of sale dated after the promissory note that states that the lender sold him a field of his, Admon says that the borrower can say: Were I really indebted to you, you should have collected the loan when you sold me the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>This does not prove anything. It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>lender <span class="gemarra-regular">was perspicacious, as he sold </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">the land </span>for a good reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">he can take </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">as collateral from him </span>in lieu of the outstanding loan. This mishna indicates that even property acquired by the borrower after the promissory note is written is liened.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">speak </span>of a case where the debt is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the debtor? With regard to collecting the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>the debt is collected from any property currently in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">even from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak that is upon his shoulders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised to us, </span>it was with regard to a case where the borrower wrote: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it to others. The dilemma also pertains to a case where the borrower wrote: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeathed </span>it to his heirs. In these cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Can the lender repossess the property from the buyer or heir?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the house collapsed on </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon his father, or upon </span>a certain person <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon those </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he stands to inherit, </span>and it is unknown who died first, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> depends on the circumstances. If the son <span class="gemarra-regular">bore </span>the responsibility to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife and </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor, </span>and the son had no money with which to pay them except that which he might inherit from his father, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s heirs say: The son died first and afterward the father died, </span>and therefore the son did not inherit property from his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the creditors say: The father died first </span>and afterward the son died, there is a dispute with regard to how to rule. In this case, the creditors claim that the son inherited his father’s property, and therefore they have a lien upon the property.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that when the borrower writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells </span>it to others, it is not liened, and that when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeaths </span>it to his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not liened, </span>then the mishna is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Although the father indeed died first, </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> comparable to one where the borrower writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, as the son acquired the property after receiving the loan. This indicates that a lien can be placed upon property that one will acquire in the future.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span>the Sages: Rabbi <span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira, our colleague, interpreted </span>the mishna as follows: In this case, the creditors do not claim the property because it is liened. Rather, they claim it because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the orphans to repay their father’s debt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi objects to this: </span>If the promissory note does not place a lien on the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral</span> agreement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav and Shmuel both say: A loan by oral </span>agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be collected, neither from the heirs nor from the buyers. </span>

Daf 157b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? This mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world. </span>Similarly, Rabbi Meir maintains that one can place a lien on property that the borrower will subsequently acquire.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yaakov from Nehar Pekod says in the name of Ravina: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 10:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">Promissory notes that are antedated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that are dated prior to the date on which the loan actually was given, <span class="gemarra-regular">are invalid. </span>This is because the promissory note places a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender appears to have a lien on property that the borrower sold prior to taking out the loan, enabling the lender to fraudulently repossess it from the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>promissory notes <span class="gemarra-regular">that are postdate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are valid, </span>as this does not enable the lender to defraud a buyer.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liened </span>even when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells </span>it to others, or when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeaths </span>it to his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">postdated </span>promissory notes <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? </span>They should be invalid, as in some instances they enable the creditor to fraudulently repossess property that is not liened, e.g., if the borrower acquires property after receiving the loan but before the date on the promissory note, and he sells it after that date. This case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>comparable to one where the borrower writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? This mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to collecting a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of land, how </span>does it happen that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a field to another and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed it </span>from the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the value of the land from the seller, he <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the principal </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that was sold to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he collects the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liened </span>even when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells </span>it to others, or when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeaths </span>it to his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor collect </span>his debt by repossessing the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>from the buyer? Since the enhancement was not extant at the time of the loan, it is not liened.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>mishna? This mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer </span>ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world. </span>The dilemma of Shmuel is raised according to the opinion of the Rabbis.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that when the borrower writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells </span>it to others, it is not liened, and that when he writes: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will acquire </span>shall be liened, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeaths </span>it to his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not liened, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not liened </span>and the following question will not arise. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is liened, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>money from one lender <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>money from another lender, stating in both cases that the property that he will acquire shall be liened, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>land? Does <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>lender <span class="gemarra-regular">have a lien upon </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>lender <span class="gemarra-regular">have a lien upon </span>the property?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: This matter was raised before us, and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a response <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span>lender <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the property, since his lien came first. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>The lenders <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so teaches Rabba bar Avuh: </span>The lenders <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: The first time Rav Ashi </span>taught this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to us: The first </span>lender <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">The last time Rav Ash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> taught this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to us: </span>The lenders <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>the property between them.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to collecting a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of land, how </span>does it occur that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">sold a field to another, and </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the value of the land from the seller, he <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the principal </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that was sold to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he collects the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property. And if it is so </span>that in general, the property is divided between the creditors, then, since both the creditor and the buyer have a lien upon the enhancement of the property, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>collect only <span class="gemarra-regular">half of </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches </span>that the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the enhancement?

<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: They divide </span>the property under dispute between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>The guaranteed <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>previous ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">status</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the husband’s heirs, </span>since the marriage contract is collected from the husband’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that is brought into and taken out </span>of the marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">with her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., usufruct property that remains in the wife’s possession during her marriage, remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the heirs of the </span>woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father. </span>

Daf 158b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Hillel, the guaranteed property that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains its previous ownership status. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In whose possession </span>does the guaranteed property remain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>It remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the husband’s heirs, </span>since the husband is liable to compensate his wife for guaranteed property in the event of loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> It remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the wife’s heirs, </span>as the property came from her father’s house and belongs to her.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says in the name of bar Kappara: They divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise bar Kappara teaches </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since these </span>heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">come to inherit and those </span>heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">come to inherit, </span>and neither can prove his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>the property between them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">the house collapsed on </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon his mother, </span>and it is unknown who died first, the following claims arise: The mother’s paternal family claims that the son died first, and therefore they inherit from the mother, and the son’s heirs claim that the mother died first and her son inherited from her, and therefore they inherit from the son. In this case, both <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>Sages, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">concede that they divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: In this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that the property </span>retains <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> previous ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">status</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">troubled by </span>those cases where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">are in disagreement. But </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">you come to bring upon us a disagreement </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>case where they <span class="gemarra-regular">agree?</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that according to Rabbi Akiva, the property retains its previous ownership status. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In whose possession </span>does the property remain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ila says: </span>It remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the mother’s heirs. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when he was still in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the son’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Zeira ascended </span>to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he adopted the opinion of Rabbi Ila, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">adopted the opinion </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi Zeira said: Conclude from </span>this incident <span class="gemarra-regular">that the air of Eretz Yisrael makes </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">wise, </span>as when I ascended to Eretz Yisrael I accepted the opinion of Rabbi Ila, who was also from Eretz Yisrael, whereas Rabba, who remained in Babylonia, accepted my former opinion.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that the property remains in the possession of the mother’s heirs? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: Since the inheritance was </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of that tribe </span>of the mother, it is not removed from their possession in order to transfer it to the son’s heirs, who are from a different tribe.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">troubled by </span>those cases where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">are in disagreement. </span>But do you come to bring upon us a disagreement with regard to the case where they agree? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shamlai said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai was a disciple-colleague of Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> and not just a disciple, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he said to him: </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you come, </span>in the second person, rather than using the more formal third person.
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>Eretz Yisrael: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a son who borrowed </span>money based <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the security of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father’s property during his father’s lifetime, and </span>whose father subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, his son repossesses </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the buyers. And this is the </span>most <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> to understand <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary law. </span>The Gemara clarifies the ruling: If the son <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed, what does he repossess? </span>He needs to repay a debt, not to collect payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, what is the relevance of the buyers </span>in this matter? There is no mention of them in the premise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, </span>it is in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner

Daf 159a

that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a son who sold </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during his father’s lifetime, and </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son repossesses </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the buyers. And this is a difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary law, </span>as the buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the son’s son: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">your father sell </span>the property to us <span class="gemarra-regular">and you repossess </span>it?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come </span>to repossess the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of </span>the right of my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father </span>to the property, as I inherit directly from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them into princes throughout the land” </span>(Psalms 45:17). The phrase “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, and he does not inherit through his father.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>there is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to monetary law that poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is the difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn son who sold, during his father’s lifetime, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the firstborn </span>that he was set to inherit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">died in his father’s lifetime, his son can repossess </span>the portion of the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">from the buyers. And this is a difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary law, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">his father sells </span>the property and <span class="gemarra-regular">he repossesses </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Here too, he says: I come </span>to repossess the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of </span>the right of my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father </span>to the property, this is not a valid claim, as, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he comes </span>to repossess the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of </span>the right of his <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father, what is the relevance of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the firstborn, </span>since he is not his grandfather’s firstborn?
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come </span>to repossess the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of </span>the right of my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father </span>to the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet I receive the portion of the firstborn, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I stand in </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s stead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>there is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to monetary law that poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficulty, this is the difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">knew testimony supporting </span>another, and his testimony was written <span class="gemarra-regular">in a document before he became a robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became a robber </span>and was disqualified from bearing witness.

The difficulty is that <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deemed credible, </span>although he knows of the matter with certainty, is it logical that <span class="gemarra-regular">others are deemed credibl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and his signature is ratified according to their testimony? <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is a difficult </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary law.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty?

But others may ratify his handwriting. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty? Perhaps here too, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the signature <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">his handwriting </span>before he became an interested party, and the witnesses testify merely that the document was already ratified.

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Here too, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the signature <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">his handwriting </span>before he became a relative, this is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>Others may testify as to the validity of his handwriting <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the signature <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">his handwriting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty? Perhaps it is the King’s edict, </span>i.e., a divine decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the testimony of a son-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deemed credible, and </span>yet the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">others is deemed credible, and </span>the reason he is disqualified is <span class="gemarra-regular">not that he is </span>suspected of <span class="gemarra-regular">lying. </span>This must be so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not say so, </span>why are <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses and Aaron </span>disqualified from bearing witness <span class="gemarra-regular">for their father-in-law? </span>Could this be <span class="gemarra-regular">because their </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deemed credible? Rather, it is the King’s edict that </span>even Moses and Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not bear witness for </span>their relatives. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, it is the King’s edic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>a son-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not testify as to </span>the validity of <span class="gemarra-regular">his handwriting for his father-in-law.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the difficulty is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually as we said initially, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that if a son sold some of his father’s property and then died, the son’s son repossesses the property from the buyers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>posed <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for you: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” </span>(Psalms 45:17), which apparently indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, this is not difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written as a blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The verse does not indicate the halakhic status of the grandson’s inheritance, and the reason he can repossess the property is still difficult.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But can you say </span>that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written as a blessing, </span>

Daf 159b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>indicate anything?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in the mishna (157a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A house collapsed on </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon his father, or upon </span>a certain person <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon those </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he stands to inherit, </span>and it is unknown who died first. If the son <span class="gemarra-regular">bore</span> the responsibility to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife and </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor, </span>and the son had no money with which to pay them except that which he might inherit from his father, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s heirs say: The son died first and afterward the father died, </span>and therefore the son did not inherit property from his father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the creditor says: The father died first and afterward the son died, </span>there is a dispute as to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The son therefore inherited his father’s property, and his creditor has a lien upon the property, enabling him to collect payment from the property even after the son’s death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>correct to explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s heirs </span>are the son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons, </span>and the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he stands to inherit, </span>is referring to the deceased son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if it enters your mind </span>to maintain that the grandson <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot say: I come </span>to repossess the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of </span>the right of my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s father </span>to the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when it is written </span>in the verse in Psalms: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In the place of your fathers shall be your sons,” </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is written as a blessing, </span>then the mishna is difficult. According to this understanding, grandsons inherit from their grandfather only through their father. If so, even <span class="gemarra-regular">if the son died </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward the father died, what of it? Let the creditor say to </span>the son’s sons: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">their father’s inheritance </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I am taking, </span>as the grandsons inherit from their grandfather only through their father.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, the father’s heirs are </span>the deceased son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, </span>who certainly inherit from their father directly, and the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he stands to inherit, </span>is referring to the deceased son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s brothers. </span>Therefore, one cannot derive from the mishna that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly.
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inheriting from his mother </span>while he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave, in order to bequeath </span>that inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers? </span>If a son dies, and afterward his mother dies, does the deceased son inherit from his mother, and subsequently bequeath the inheritance to his paternal brothers, who are not related to the mother? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said to them: You learned it </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Consider <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">father who was taken captive </span>and died in captivity, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his son died in the province,</span> i.e., at home, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consider the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a son who was taken captive </span>and died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his father died in the province. </span>Since it is not known who died first, <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s heirs and the son’s heirs divide </span>the inheritance.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the case <span class="gemarra-regular">is as </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are the father’s heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and who are the son’s heirs? </span>The same individuals inherit from both of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>Consider the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a father who was taken captive </span>and died in captivity, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his daughter’s son die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the province, and </span>consider the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">son of his daughter who was taken captive </span>and died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the father of </span>the captive’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother died in the province, and we do not know which of them died first. </span>If the father died first, his daughter’s son inherits from him, and the son’s paternal relatives subsequently inherit from the son. If the son died first, the father’s heirs inherit the father’s estate. Since it is unknown which of them died first, <span class="gemarra-regular">the father’s heirs and the son’s heirs divide </span>the inheritance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that a son inherits from his mother while in the grave, <span class="gemarra-regular">although the son indeed died first, he should inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother’s father </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in his grave and bequeath </span>his inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers, </span>and the son’s heirs should receive the entire inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the son does not inherit from his mother </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave in order to bequeath </span>that inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said to Abaye: We learn </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna (158b) <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the house collapsed on </span>a son <span class="gemarra-regular">and upon his mother, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>Sages, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">concede that </span>the son’s heirs and the mother’s heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the property between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that a son inherits from his mother while in the grave, <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">son indeed died first, he should inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in his grave and they should inherit </span>from him, i.e., he should bequeath his inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers. Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>that mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the son does not inherit from his mother </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave in order to bequeath </span>that inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that this is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that a son does not inherit from his mother while in the grave? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer, </span>concerning the transfer of inheritance from one tribe to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to </span>the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a son </span>(see Numbers 36:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer was stated with regard to </span>the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband</span> (see 111b–113a and Numbers 36:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer that was stated with regard to </span>the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a husban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the husband does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>while he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in order to bequeath that inheritance to his heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in the case categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer that was stated with regard to </span>the inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a son, the son does not inherit from his mother </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the grav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to bequeath </span>that inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his paternal brothers.</span>
§ There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: I am selling to you </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">the property </span>that I own <span class="gemarra-regular">of bar Sisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There was one </span>parcel of <span class="gemarra-regular">land that was called </span>the tract <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin. </span>The seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>latter parcel of land <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin, and it is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">called: Of the house of bar Sisin, </span>and therefore it is not included in the sale.
The matter <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the buyer. Rava said to Rav Naḥman: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>which in this case is the buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction between </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, and between </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman </span>and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman.</span>
The Gemara explains the contradictions. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: What do you want, </span>i.e., what are you doing, <span class="gemarra-regular">with this house </span>of mine? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">I purchased it from you and I </span>worked and <span class="gemarra-regular">profited </span>from it for <span class="gemarra-regular">the years </span>necessary for establishing the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership. </span>The claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was </span>traveling <span class="gemarra-regular">among the settlements </span>in a distant location, and I was unaware that you were residing in my house, which is why I did not lodge a protest.
The one residing in the house <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>for a judgment. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go clarify your profiting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., prove that you really resided there for three years, and then the case can be judged. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this the </span>correct <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>Therefore, the claimant should have to prove that the possessor did not reside in the house. The first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava is difficult, </span>as it is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the second statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman </span>is difficult, as it is contradicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the second statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman. </span>In the first case, Rav Naḥman ruled in favor of the buyer, and Rava ruled in favor of the seller, whereas in the second case their rulings were reversed.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the first statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>and the second statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>with regard to the property of bar Sisin, the <span class="gemarra-regular">seller stands in </span>possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, </span>and the buyer claims the parcel of land from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer stands in </span>possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, </span>since he dwells in the house, and the seller wishes to evict him.
The contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman and </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult as well, </span>because there, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I am hereby selling you all of the property that I own <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of bar Sisin, and </span>this parcel of land is <span class="gemarra-regular">called: Of the house of bar Sisin, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">incumbent on him to reveal that it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not of the house of bar Sisin. But here, </span>in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, it <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be </span>considered as any case <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>than one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the possessor is <span class="gemarra-regular">holding a document </span>as evidence that he purchased the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wouldn’t we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">ratify your document, and </span>only then be <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>as the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In this case as well, since his presumptive ownership is in place of a document, he needs to clarify the matter by means of witnesses. 


Daf 160a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> document, its witnesses </span>are to sign <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, </span>i.e., on the written side of the paper. In a folded and <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>document, <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses </span>are to sign <span class="gemarra-regular">on the back of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">whose witnesses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>their signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">on the back of it, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">whose witnesses wrote </span>their signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">inside of it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">both of these </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥanina ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel says: A tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">whose witnesses wrote </span>their signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">inside of it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid, because one can transform it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into an ordinary </span>document by untying it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel says: Everything </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with regional custom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">An ordinary document </span>is rendered valid <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>its having at least <span class="gemarra-regular">two witnesses, and a tied </span>document is rendered valid <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>its having at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>witnesses. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">in which a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> single witness wrote </span>his signature, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two witnesses wrote </span>their signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not valid.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? What biblical basis is there for the existence of these two types of documents? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “They shall buy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and call witnesses” </span>(Jeremiah 32:44). When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>

Daf 160b

<span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document. When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And seal them,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tied </span>document. The next phrase, “and call witnesses [<span class="it-text">veha’ed</span> <span class="it-text">edim</span>],” which more literally would be translated: And have witnesses bear witness, is interpreted as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And have bear witness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veha’ed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>this indicates the need for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, as the term “witness [<span class="it-text">ed</span>]” in the Torah generally refers to two witnesses. As to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“witnesses [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">edim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>this additional term indicates the need for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>How can the verse call for both two witnesses and three witnesses? Rabbi Ḥanina explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two </span>witnesses are required <span class="gemarra-regular">for an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ordinary </span>document, and <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>are required <span class="gemarra-regular">for a tied </span>document.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But I </span>can just as well <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the tied document requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its ties, </span>it stands to reason that it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses, </span>requiring three rather than two.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram says </span>that there is a different source for two kinds of documents, <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here: “So I took the deed of the purchase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that which was sealed, the terms and conditions, and that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which was open” </span>(Jeremiah 32:11). When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So I took the deed of the purchase,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document. When it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which was sealed,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tied </span>document. When it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And that which was open,” this</span> is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary, </span>unfolded part <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>document. 
Rafram continues: With regard to the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The terms and conditions,” these are the matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>distinguish <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">from a tied </span>one. <span class="gemarra-regular">How</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so? </span>What are the details that differentiate the two types of documents? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the ordinary document, has <span class="gemarra-regular">two witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and that </span>one, the tied document, has <span class="gemarra-regular">three witnesses. </span>And in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the ordinary document, <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses </span>are signed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, </span>on the front side, while in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, the tied document, <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses </span>are signed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the back</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of it.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I </span>can just as well <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the tied document requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its ties, </span>it stands to reason that it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to its witnesses, </span>requiring three rather than two.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Yeḥezkel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that there is a different source for two sets of <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> for two types of documents <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of three witnesses shall a matter be established” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>witnesses’ <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony is established with two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>did the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">specify for you </span>that it is also established <span class="gemarra-regular">with three, </span>which is self-evident? Rather, this verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you </span>that there is a requirement for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ordinary </span>document, and a requirement for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">for a tied </span>document.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But I </span>can just as well <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse</span> it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the tied document requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ties, </span>it stands to reason that it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>to be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its witnesses, </span>requiring three rather than two.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>verses <span class="gemarra-regular">are coming for this</span> purpose, to teach that there are two types of documents? But <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">comes for its</span> own <span class="gemarra-regular">purpose. </span>The first verse comes <span class="gemarra-regular">for that which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seal them, </span>and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44), it is merely to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us good advice, </span>that people should carefully document their purchases in order to provide permanent proof of purchase. When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So I took the deed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the purchase” </span>(Jeremiah 32:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">this was </span>merely how that <span class="gemarra-regular">incident </span>occurred, and the phrase is not intended to teach any <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“At the mouth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses </span>shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), this is stated in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to juxtapose three </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span>witnesses for several reasons, as delineated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the dispute between Rabbi Akiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis </span>(<span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 5b).
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the entire institution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>document is <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>in origin, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>all these <span class="gemarra-regular">verses </span>that were cited above by various <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> were intended as <span class="gemarra-regular">mere suppor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for the concept of a tied document, as opposed to actual sources.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages instituted </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>document? The Gemara explains: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where there were </span>many <span class="gemarra-regular">priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they were very quick tempered, and they would </span>seek to <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce their wives </span>impetuously. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that a priest may not marry a divorcée, even his own ex-wife. These priests, who acted impetuously, often regretted having divorced their wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages instituted an ordinance </span>that the bill of divorce for these people should be of the tied format, which is a long, drawn-out process, hoping that <span class="gemarra-regular">meanwhile, their composure would be regained </span>and they would reconsider their decision to divorce.
The Gemara asks: This <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">bills of divorce, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">what can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be said </span>with regard to other <span class="gemarra-regular">documents? </span>Why is this procedure used for other documents as well? The Gemara answers: This was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">so that you should not differentiate between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bills of divorc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">documents.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Where do the witnesses sign </span>on a tied document? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>They sign <span class="gemarra-regular">between each tied </span>fold. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says: </span>They sign <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">back of the written </span>side, taking care that the signatures are exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the writing, on the outside.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Ḥisda: According to Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, who says </span>that the witnesses sign <span class="gemarra-regular">between each tied </span>fold, it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters our mind </span>that he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">between each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>fold <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside </span>of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is difficult, as there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, not realizing it was tied, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is no date</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on this </span>document, so it is not valid. Then, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the date is <span class="gemarra-regular">hidden between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>folds. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">opened it and saw </span>that the date was in fact between the tied folds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it is so </span>that the witnesses sign between each tied fold on the inside of the document, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>had two objections, and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no date on this </span>document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses </span>signed <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>document.
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Do you maintain </span>that Rav Huna meant that the witnesses sign <span class="gemarra-regular">between the tied </span>folds <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside? No, </span>he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">between the tied </span>folds <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside </span>of the document.
The Gemara questions Rav Huna’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us be concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the party holding the document <span class="gemarra-regular">falsified </span>some information <span class="gemarra-regular">and wrote whatever he wanted. And </span>this is a concern, as there are already <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses signed </span>on the document. In an ordinary document the witnesses sign immediately following the text, so there is no possibility of adding to the text. A tied document has part of its text written in the folds, but also has a part written on the face of the document on the unfolded paper, before or after the text in the folded part. If the witnesses sign between the folds there is the possibility of writing additional text in the unfolded section.
The Gemara explains: The case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is written in </span>the document: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and established. </span>That is, every folded document must contain this formula at the end of the text, to prevent forgery, as any writing after this formula would be disregarded.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us be concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote whatever he wanted and afterward wrote </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>time: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and established. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">We write </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>declaration of: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we do not write two </span>declarations of: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and established. </span>Therefore, anything written after the first declaration would be rejected, even if followed by a repetition of the declaration.
The Gemara questions further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">erased </span>the declaration: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and established, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote whatever he wanted </span>over the erasure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward wrote</span> the declaration: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and established. </span>The Gemara responds: How could this happen? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>A document that includes <span class="gemarra-regular">a suspended </span>correction of text inserted between lines of the document, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">verifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> at the end of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid; </span>

Daf 161a

but a document with a reference to words written over <span class="gemarra-regular">an erasur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not valid, even if it is verified </span>at the end of the document. At the end of a document, before the formula: Everything is confirmed and established, is written, any corrections made in the document are verified by adding to the text: On line so-and-so, such and such a word has been added, or some similar formulation. This may be done only for inserted corrections, not for erasures.
The Gemara clarifies this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they said that an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">erasure </span>on a document renders the document <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid only </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place </span>on the document where the declaration: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and established</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> should have been written, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only if the erasure <span class="gemarra-regular">is the measure </span>of space in which the declaration: Everything is <span class="gemarra-regular">confirmed and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established, </span>can be written. The only concern with erasures is that the crucial formula: Everything is confirmed and established, might have been erased, as this would allow for unlimited forgery. If the erasure is such that this formula could not possibly have been erased, the document is valid.
§ Rami bar Ḥama asked Rav Ḥisda: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Yirmeya bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba, who says </span>that the witnesses sign <span class="gemarra-regular">on the back</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the written </span>side, taking care that the signatures are exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the writing, on the outside let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the party holding the document <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write whatever he wants on the inside, </span>i.e., the front of the document, adding to the text, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">have extra witnesses sign on the outside, and </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to anyone questioning the number of witnesses being more than the minimum: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did </span>this in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">increase </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>the more to publicize the matters written in the document.
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you maintain </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses sign in order, </span>that is, one under the other, starting from the top of the page on the back? This is not correct; rather, the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses sign from bottom to top</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The witnesses sign in a perpendicular direction relative to the text of the document. The first signature begins at the reverse side of the last line of the document, and it continues upward toward the first line. There is therefore no possibility of adding to the text of the document, as, if the text extended beyond the beginning of the signatures, it would be recognized as a forgery.
Rami bar Ḥama continues to question the method of signature prescribed by Rav Yirmeya bar Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps something </span><span class="gemarra-regular">detrimental </span>to the holder of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">happens </span>to appear <span class="gemarra-regular">in the final line </span>of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he excises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the final line, and </span>in doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">excises </span>the first name of the witness on the opposite side as well. For instance, if the witness’s name is Reuven, son of Ya’akov, he will excise <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven along with </span>the final line of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendered valid with </span>the remaining part of the signature: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Ya’akov, witness.” As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 87b): If one signs: <span class="gemarra-regular">Son of so-and-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, witness, </span>without mentioning his own name, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is written “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven, son of” on one line, </span>i.e., opposite the final line of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “Ya’akov, witness,” above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> beginning from the penultimate line of the document and continuing upward in a perpendicular manner. That is, a tied document is valid only if the witnesses sign in this manner. In this case, if the final line of the document is excised, all that will remain of the signature will be: “Ya’akov, witness.”
Rami bar Ḥama continues to ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excise </span>the final line of the document, along with the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“Reuven, son of,” and </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendered valid with </span>the remaining part of the signature: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov, witness.” As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 87b): If someone signs just: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so, witness, </span>the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">witness is not written </span>after the witnesses’ names. That is, a tied document is valid only if the word witness does not appear after the signatures. It is only in such a case that the document cannot be materially changed by excising the final line without rendering the witnesses’ names disqualified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you wish, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that actually </span>the witness <span class="gemarra-regular">did write</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “witness” </span>after his signature, and the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where we know </span>for a fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that this signature, </span>which consists of the words “Ya’akov, witness,” 

Daf 161b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not Yaakov’s </span>signature. That is, it is known for a fact that there is no one living in the city where the document was written who is named Ya’akov and whose signature matches the signature on this document. Therefore, the court will recognize that the signature must have originally stated: “So-and-so, son of Ya’akov, witness,” and that the last line had been excised, and they will invalidate it.
Rami bar Ḥama challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps </span>this witness <span class="gemarra-regular">signed using the name of his father</span> instead of his own name, as a gesture of respect toward his father. The Gemara answers: This is not done; <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not discard his own name and sign</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> using </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the name of his father.</span>
Rami bar Ḥama challenges further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the witness <span class="gemarra-regular">made </span>this name <span class="gemarra-regular">into a mere distinguishing mark </span>that he uses as his signature, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is known that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>used to <span class="gemarra-regular">draw</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> as his signature mark, rather than signing his name, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina </span>used to <span class="gemarra-regular">draw a palm </span><span class="gemarra-regular">branch </span>as his signature mark, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>used to sign just the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">samekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya </span>used to sign just the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Huna</span> used to sign his name by drawing a ship’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mast [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">makhota</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person is not</span> so <span class="gemarra-regular">insolent </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">to use his father’s name as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a distinguishing mark.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Why do you need all this? </span>Why go to such lengths to answer the question posed above? There is a simpler answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">whose witnesses do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> end on a single line </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid. </span>The Gemara had previously assumed that the witnesses sign one after the other, beginning at the document’s bottom line and going upward toward the first line; this arrangement leaves open the possibility that the signature of the first witness could be truncated by an unscrupulous party. Mar Zutra explains that this is not so; rather, the signatures are written with each one beginning opposite the bottom line and heading upward toward the beginning of the document. Therefore, if a line of text is excised from the bottom of the document, the names of all the witnesses on the reverse side will be truncated, and the forgery will become apparent.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>There are two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to documents: For <span class="gemarra-regular">any erasure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in a document, the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">must write </span>at the end of the document: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is their verification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, he must list the erasures, stating that on line so-and-so there is an erasure and a correction stating such and such, for each erasure. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the second <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">must review </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of the details of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">documen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the final line </span>of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>for this second requirement? 

Daf 162a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not learn </span>any new details <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">final</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of a document. There is a concern that the holder of the document may have written in an extra line of text to his advantage, between the text and the witnesses’ signatures. Therefore, any new information contained in the last line is disregarded. Since the final line is disregarded, it is necessary that the final line of a document contain only a review of what is already written in it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to Rav Amram: From where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>know <span class="gemarra-regular">this? </span>Rav Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:1): If one writing a document <span class="gemarra-regular">distanced the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">two lines from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the text </span>of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid, </span>as it would be possible for the holder of the document to fill in false information in those lines. But if one distanced the signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> line </span>from the text, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
Rav Amram analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>blank <span class="gemarra-regular">lines </span>that that the document is not valid? If you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document will take advantage of those two blank lines, and <span class="gemarra-regular">forge </span>unverified information <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span>it in those lines, then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one line </span>left blank <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">forge </span>information <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span>it in that line. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not learn </span>any new details <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">final</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> line </span>of a document? Therefore, only when two lines are left blank is there a concern that false information would be added to the penultimate line. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is so. 

Daf 162b

<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: If the space of <span class="gemarra-regular">a line and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> is left blank, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara seeks a solution to the dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier: If one writing a document <span class="gemarra-regular">distanced the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">two lines</span> from the text of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid. </span>One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if there is a gap of only <span class="gemarra-regular">a line and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a half, </span>the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara deflects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one writing a document distanced the witnesses’ signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">one line </span>from the text of the document, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>One can infer: It is only when there is a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">one line </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid, but </span>if there is a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">a line and a half </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, no </span>inference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>halakhic conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span> reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a different source, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:10): If one writing a document <span class="gemarra-regular">distanced the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">two lines from the text </span>of the document, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid, </span>but if the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than that, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>It is clear from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that any gap less than two full lines does not invalidate the document.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were four or five witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> signed on the document, and one of them was found</span> to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a relative </span>of one of the parties in the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one of them was found to be otherwise <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from bearing witness, the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>on the document may be <span class="gemarra-regular">established via the other </span>witnesses.
The Gemara draws a further conclusion from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiyya, as Ḥizkiyya says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">filled in </span>the gap between the document and the signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">relatives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
Ḥizkiyya continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not be surprised </span>by this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a similar situation is found with regard to the roofing of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. Empty <span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>in the roofing <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukk</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifies </span>the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> if the space extends for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, whereas materials that are <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit </span>to be used as <span class="gemarra-regular">roofing disqualify </span>the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> only if the unfit material extends for <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths. If a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> had a gap in its roofing of three handbreadths it is disqualified, but if the gap is filled in with unfit material the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is valid, since it is less than four handbreadths. This is comparable to the situation with a document: If there is a significant gap between the text and the signatures the document is not valid, but if the gap is filled in with signatures of those disqualified from bearing witness it is valid.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to the gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>blank <span class="gemarra-regular">lines </span>between the text and the signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>invalidates the document, 

Daf 163a

does this refer to the size of lines <span class="gemarra-regular">with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> space </span>between lines added? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>referring to lines of writing themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">without their spaces?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yitzḥak said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">stands to reason that </span>it is referring to the lines <span class="gemarra-regular">with their spaces</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it were to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that it is referring to the lines <span class="gemarra-regular">without their spaces, for what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one line without its space fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> did not have to state that a document with a single blank line after the text, measured without counting spaces, is not forgeable; this is obvious. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this claim that the reference is to two lines <span class="gemarra-regular">with their spaces. </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>this claim that it is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shabbtai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says in the name of Ḥizkiyya: </span>With regard to the gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>blank <span class="gemarra-regular">lines </span>between the text and the signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>invalidates the document, the lines are measured <span class="gemarra-regular">by the handwriting of witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the handwriting of a scribe, </span>who is presumably skilled enough to write in a smaller script. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who forges </span>a document, adding additional lines to the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">would not go to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scrib</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>ask him to <span class="gemarra-regular">forge </span>it; he would execute the forgery himself, or have another unscrupulous person who is not a professional scribe forge it. Therefore, in order to present a concern for possible forgery, a document must have two blank lines that are measured by the handwriting of an ordinary person, such as one of the witnesses.
The Gemara has established that the width of the gap required to invalidate the document is two lines with interlinear space. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>interlinear space is necessary to invalidate the document? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak ben Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: For example, </span>enough to write the Hebrew word <span class="gemarra-italic">lekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>then the Hebrew word <span class="gemarra-italic">lekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>word <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of that </span>one. These two words each consist of the two letters <span class="it-text">lamed</span> and final <span class="it-text">khaf</span>; the former has a projection that fully occupies the interlinear space above it, and the latter has a projection that fully occupies the interlinear space below it. Writing these words one under the other, then, would require an additional interlinear space above and below both lines. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rav Yitzḥak ben Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">lines with four</span> interlinear <span class="gemarra-regular">spaces</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami states </span>a different opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Ulla: For example, </span>enough to write a <span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper </span>line <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a final <span class="gemarra-italic">khaf</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>line. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">lines with three</span> interlinear <span class="gemarra-regular">spaces, </span>one above the first line, one between the two lines, and one beneath the second line.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu states </span>a different opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>enough to write the name <span class="gemarra-regular">Barukh ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levi on one line. </span>Barukh contains a final <span class="it-text">khaf</span>, and Levi contains a <span class="it-text">lamed</span>. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">line with two </span>interlinear <span class="gemarra-regular">spaces, </span>one above the line and one beneath the line.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a gap of two lines invalidates the document n <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if that space is <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and the text </span>of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if there is a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a court’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ratificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the document, which follows the witnesses’ signatures, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>space than this, the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>about the case where the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses and the text, </span>that it invalidates the document? There is a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">may forge </span>additional lines <span class="gemarra-regular">and write whatever he wants, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the witnesses </span>have already <span class="gemarra-regular">signed </span>at the bottom, giving the appearance that they attest to the added lines as well. But the same concern can be raised concerning a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the court’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well: </span>There, too, he can <span class="gemarra-regular">forge </span>additional lines <span class="gemarra-regular">and write</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whatever he wants, and </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses sign it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with the court’s ratification giving the appearance that it attests to the added lines and signatures as well. Why is this document valid?
The Gemara explains: When is a gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the court’s ratification not problematic, according to Rav? Only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">inks i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> the blank space with lines or dots, to prevent information from being added there. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the text of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> document </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be made irrelevant in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span> the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">ink in [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metayyet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> the blank space. Why, then, was it taught categorically that the witnesses must sign within two lines of the text?
The Gemara answers: Inking in the gap between the text and the signatures of the witnesses will not help, as people might <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>i.e., the concern might be raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">The witnesses are signed </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inking in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is possible that the witnesses’ signatures were affixed only to attest that the inking was done in their presence and that the inking in is not a sign of duplicity, and their signatures do not relate to the actual text of the document. The Gemara asks: If so, raise the same concern when the gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>court’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification </span>is inked in; there too, people might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: The court’s </span>ratification <span class="gemarra-regular">is signed </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for the inking in, </span>and not for the actual text of the document. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A court does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not sign on </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">inking in; </span>their ratification is always in reference to the entire document.
The Gemara raises another issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document will <span class="gemarra-regular">excise </span>the entire text that appears <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">erase the inked-in </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">and writ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whatever</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he wants </span>in that erased area, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>have unscrupulous <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sign </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this would be a valid document, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: A document that comes </span>before the court for ratification in which <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>content <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses are </span>both written <span class="gemarra-regular">over an erasure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>The court ratification would then be assumed to be referring to this new, forged document. 

Daf 163b

 <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well, </span>i.e., this concern does not apply,<span class="gemarra-regular"> according to Rav Kahana, who teaches in the name of Shmuel</span> that a document in which its content and its witnesses’ signatures are both written over an erasure is valid; according to him, all<span class="gemarra-regular"> is well. </span>It is Rav who says that an inked-in gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the court’s ratification is acceptable, and it is Shmuel who says that a document that is written and signed over an erasure is acceptable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rav Tavyumei,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches </span>this latter statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav, what can be said? </span>According to him, Rav said both statements, and taken together they pose a difficulty: The inked-in gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the ratification can easily be erased and a new document with signatures can be written over the erasure.
The Gemara answers: Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that in<span class="gemarra-regular"> all cases like this, </span>where a document and its witnesses’ signatures are written over an erasure and there is a court ratification on a non-erased part of the paper, the later court <span class="gemarra-regular">ratifies </span>the document<span class="gemarra-regular"> not on the basis of the </span>previous court’s<span class="gemarra-regular"> ratification that is on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>only<span class="gemarra-regular"> on the basis of the </span>signatures of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses that are on it.</span> Therefore, the forging of a document in this manner is impossible, as the prior ratification of the court is disregarded, and the witnesses will attest to what they signed upon.
The Gemara cites another opinion:<span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a gap of one line does not invalidate the document <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case where that space is <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the text</span> of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the gap is<span class="gemarra-regular"> between the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> a court’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ratificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the document, then a space of <span class="gemarra-regular">even one lin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> renders the document <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid.</span>
The Gemara asks:<span class="gemarra-regular"> What is different </span>about the case where there is a one-line gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the court’s<span class="gemarra-regular"> ratification </span>that you say it is not valid? The Gemara answers: There is a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document will<span class="gemarra-regular"> excise </span>the entire text of the document at <span class="gemarra-regular">the top </span>of the paper <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">write</span> a new, brief document, with <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> text <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses on one line.</span> The court’s ratification will appear to verify the new, forged document. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> Rabbi Yoḥanan<span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a document that comes </span>before the court with<span class="gemarra-regular"> its</span> text<span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses</span> appearing <span class="gemarra-regular">on one lin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is valid.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the same problem <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span> exists when there is a one-line gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between the witnesses’ </span>signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and the text: </span>There should be a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">excise </span>the entire text of the document at<span class="gemarra-regular"> the top </span>of the paper <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">write whatever he wants </span>in a brief, one-line document. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the witnesses’ </span>signatures on the next line, which are there from the old document, will still be <span class="gemarra-regular">signed</span> there, appearing to attest to the veracity of the new, one-line document. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a document that comes </span>before the court with<span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>text <span class="gemarra-regular">on one line and </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses</span> appearing <span class="gemarra-regular">on another line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., on the following line, is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>there be<span class="gemarra-regular"> a concern </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps </span>the holder of the document will excise the entire document, leaving only the blank line and the signatures that follow it, and he will<span class="gemarra-regular"> write </span>a brief document in which<span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>text <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">on one line, </span>followed by the original signatures that remained from the original document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> he will <span class="gemarra-regular">say:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I did this </span>in order<span class="gemarra-regular"> to increase </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>the more to publicize the matter written in the document. The document is therefore still forgeable.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">all cases like this, </span>where a document and its witnesses’ signatures are written on one line, followed by other signatures on subsequent lines, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">ratifies </span>the document<span class="gemarra-regular"> not on the basis of the </span>signatures of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses that</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">on the bottom,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the basis of the </span>signatures of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses that </span>are<span class="gemarra-regular"> on top, </span>on the same line as the text. Therefore, the forging of a document in this manner is impossible. The false signatures of the witnesses will be discovered when those witnesses attest to what they signed upon.
§ Having cited Rav’s statement, the Gemara discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: A document that comes </span>before the court in which <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>content <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses are </span>both written <span class="gemarra-regular">over an erasure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>

Daf 164a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: </span>There is a possibility of forgery with such a document, as the holder of the document can <span class="gemarra-regular">erase </span>the original writing on the paper, then write the text of the document and have witnesses sign on the part that had been erased, <span class="gemarra-regular">then</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">erase </span>the document text <span class="gemarra-regular">once again,</span> substituting for it a text that is more to his advantage, leaving the original signatures in place, this is not a valid argument. Paper that has been <span class="gemarra-regular">erased once is not similar </span>in appearance<span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>paper that has been <span class="gemarra-regular">erased twice. </span>It will be seen that the signatures are on a place that had been erased once and that the text is written on a place that had been erased twice, and the forgery will be noticed.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the holder of the document will <span class="gemarra-regular">initially, </span>after the entire original document, including the signatures, has been erased, but before the second one is written,<span class="gemarra-regular"> throw </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">ink on the place </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>are to sign under the text of the second document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">erase</span> that ink. He will do this <span class="gemarra-regular">so that</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">when, </span>after the witnesses have signed,<span class="gemarra-regular"> he then erases </span>the document text and writes a false text, it will emerge that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the new document’s text, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that,</span> the signatures, will be on paper that had been <span class="gemarra-regular">erased twice.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in response:<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses may not sign </span>a document written over <span class="gemarra-regular">an erasure unless </span>the paper<span class="gemarra-regular"> was erased in their presence, </span>i.e., unless they saw the paper after its old text had been erased, before the new text was written. They will then see that the place where they are to sign has been erased twice, while the place where the document is to be written has been erased only once. They will realize that this leaves open an opportunity of subsequent erasing and falsification, and they will refrain from signing.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection</span> to the opinion of Rav from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A document in which <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> text is <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>a part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">paper </span>that has never had writing erased<span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an erasur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is<span class="gemarra-regular"> valid. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us be concerned </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps </span>the holder of the document will<span class="gemarra-regular"> erase </span>the text <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span>in its place <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever he wants, and it will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>a document where both <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>text <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">on an erasure. </span>Since Rav maintains that such a document is valid, it is easily forgeable in this manner.
The Gemara answers: Such a document is valid only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">write this: We, </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> signed on an erasure, but the document </span>text <span class="gemarra-regular">was written on</span> a part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">paper </span>that never had writing erased. If the holder of the document then tries to erase the original text and write new text in its place, the forgery will be noticed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span>do the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>this declaration? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>they write it <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath </span>their signatures, the holder of the document can simply <span class="gemarra-regular">excise</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>And<span class="gemarra-regular"> if</span> they write it<span class="gemarra-regular"> above </span>their signatures, the holder of the document can <span class="gemarra-regular">erase it </span>along with the text of the document. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They write </span>the declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the signature of one<span class="gemarra-regular"> witness and </span>the signature of the other<span class="gemarra-regular"> witness.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so,</span> that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case in which the witnesses write a declaration about the circumstances of the document’s condition, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A document in which <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> text <span class="gemarra-regular">is on an erasure</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the signatures of<span class="gemarra-regular"> its witnesses are on</span> a part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that never had writing erased is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid.</span> The Gemara presents its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why</span> is such a document <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid? Here, too,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span> the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">write</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">this:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">We, </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses, signed on paper</span> that never had writing erased,<span class="gemarra-regular"> but the document </span>text was written<span class="gemarra-regular"> on</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an erasure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well</span> it should be valid, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>can<span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>to argue that it is a forgeable document? If you say that the holder of the document, having <span class="gemarra-regular">erased </span>the original document, can <span class="gemarra-regular">erase</span> the writing <span class="gemarra-regular">once again </span>and write a new, false document, this is not a concern, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you say </span>that paper that has been <span class="gemarra-regular">erased once is not similar </span>in appearance<span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>paper that has been <span class="gemarra-regular">erased twice? </span>It would therefore be noticeable that the document had been erased a second time, and the forgery would be noticeable. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when the witnesses are signed on an erasure, </span>and the appearance of that erasure can be compared with the appearance of a double erasure. But in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the witnesses are signed not on an erasure but on paper</span> that has not had its writing erased, so that there is no contrast between a single erasure and a double erasure, the forgery would<span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>be<span class="gemarra-regular"> known.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>let the court<span class="gemarra-regular"> bring another parchment, </span>write something on it <span class="gemarra-regular">and erase it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">compare </span>this single erasure with the erasure on the document in question. If the document were erased twice, a contrast would be seen between a single erasure and a double erasure. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The erasure of this parchment is</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the erasure of that parchment. </span>A single erasure on one parchment might resemble a double erasure on a different parchment.
The Gemara continues to suggest: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us accept, </span>i.e., verify, <span class="gemarra-regular">the signatures of the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>on the document <span class="gemarra-regular">in court,</span> after which they may safely be erased; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then<span class="gemarra-regular"> erase</span> the signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and compare </span>that erasure to the erasure of the document text, to see if it was erased once or twice. In response to this question <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya says:</span> That which is <span class="gemarra-regular">erased on the same day </span>that it was written<span class="gemarra-regular"> is not</span> necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to</span> that which was <span class="gemarra-regular">erased two days </span>ago, i.e., more than a day after it was written. An older erasure looks different from a new one, so the comparison might not show that there was a double erasure in the document.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us retain </span>the document for an extra day, at which point both erasures will be old and can be compared. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are concerned for </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">an erring court. </span>If such complicated procedures were used in order to declare a document valid, there would be a chance that a particular court would not apply them properly, and that court would end up ratifying a document that was not valid.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A tied </span>document whose witnesses wrote their signatures inside of it is valid, because one can transform it into an ordinary document by untying it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel:</span>

Daf 164b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But the date of this one,</span> a tied document, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not the same as the date of that one,</span> an ordinary document. In <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary</span> document, when the king has<span class="gemarra-regular"> reigned </span>for one<span class="gemarra-regular"> year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one<span class="gemarra-regular"> year is counted for him,</span> and when he has reigned for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years,<span class="gemarra-regular"> two</span> years <span class="gemarra-regular">are counted for him.</span> By contrast, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a tied </span>document, when the king has<span class="gemarra-regular"> reigned </span>for one<span class="gemarra-regular"> year,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years<span class="gemarra-regular"> are counted for him,</span> and when he has reigned for<span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>years,<span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>years<span class="gemarra-regular"> are counted for him.</span> If a tied document is simply opened up and used as an ordinary document, then it will emerge that it is postdated by a year.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there are<span class="gemarra-regular"> times </span>this can be problematic, as in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">money</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the creditor, and the details of the loan are written <span class="gemarra-regular">in a tied</span> document. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">chances upon</span> some <span class="gemarra-regular">money in the interim, </span>i.e., during the first year after the document was written, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> he<span class="gemarra-regular"> repays</span> the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and says to him: Give me </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>promissory<span class="gemarra-regular"> note, </span>as I have just repaid you. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the debtor:<span class="gemarra-regular"> I lost </span>the document and cannot give it to you. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in lieu of returning the promissory note, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt </span>for the debtor, as protection against a second collection.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> then,<span class="gemarra-regular"> when</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">time for</span> repayment written in the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives, </span>the creditor will <span class="gemarra-regular">make it</span> into <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary</span> document by undoing its stitches and opening it up, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> he can then <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the debtor:<span class="gemarra-regular"> It is now that you borrowed this </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from me, </span>as attested in this promissory note, and the receipt you have in your possession is for a previous debt, as its date precedes the date on my document.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not write a receipt </span>in such cases. If a creditor loses his promissory note, the debtor need not pay him at all, out of concern that the debt may one day be collected again when the promissory note is found. He is not required to pay the debt and accept only a receipt, which he will then have to guard permanently to protect himself against a second collection.
The Gemara asks with regard to the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And was Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">expert in </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">tied</span> documents? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>wasn’t there<span class="gemarra-regular"> a certain tied</span> document <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">came before</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi saw the date he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This is</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a postdated document. And </span>a Sage named <span class="gemarra-regular">Zuni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi:<span class="gemarra-regular"> Such is the custom of this nation; </span>when the king has <span class="gemarra-regular">reigned </span>for one<span class="gemarra-regular"> year, two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">are counted for him,</span> and when he has reigned for<span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>years,<span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>years<span class="gemarra-regular"> are counted for him. </span>The document is therefore not postdated. From this anecdote it is clear that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi himself had not been familiar with this practice.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">heard it from Zunin</span> he accepted the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">and held</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>way himself, and that is what prompted him to raise his objection.
§ There was<span class="gemarra-regular"> a certain document on which was written,</span> as its date: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the year of so-and-so, Archon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Arkhan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a title for a ruler, without stating any particular year of his reign. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: Let it be investigated when </span>it was that this <span class="gemarra-regular">Archon rose to his </span>position of<span class="gemarra-regular"> archon,</span> i.e., find out the year he came to power, and the validity of the document is established from that year.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the writer of the document was using an Aramaic or Hebrew term, and intended to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the reign of</span> so-and-so had already <span class="gemarra-regular">extended</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arikh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> for several years. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya says:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Such </span>is<span class="gemarra-regular"> the custom of this nation </span>where the document was written: In the<span class="gemarra-regular"> first year</span> of the king’s reign<span class="gemarra-regular"> they refer to him </span>with the title <span class="gemarra-regular">Archon; </span>in his<span class="gemarra-regular"> second </span>year<span class="gemarra-regular"> they refer to him </span>with the title <span class="gemarra-italic">Digon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">deposed </span>the ruler<span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">then</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">reinstated him, </span>and the document was written in the first year of his second reign. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>would<span class="gemarra-regular"> refer to him </span>with the title <span class="gemarra-regular">Archon</span><span class="gemarra-italic"> Digon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ Apropos these Greek terms, the Gemara cites two <span class="it-text">baraitot </span>that mention them. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Nazir</span> 1:2) that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">heina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or stated a similar expression with other comparable Greek terms, <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos said </span>that his status depends on which term he used. If he used the word <span class="gemarra-italic">heina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is a nazirite for <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> term of naziriteship, i.e., thirty days; if he said <span class="gemarra-italic">digon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is a nazirite for <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> terms of thirty days each; if he said <span class="gemarra-italic">terigon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he is a nazirite for<span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>terms; <span class="gemarra-italic">tetrigon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for<span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>terms; <span class="gemarra-italic">pentigon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for<span class="gemarra-regular"> five </span>terms.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in another <span class="it-text">baraita </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Nega’im</span> 6:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">A round house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or one that is shaped like <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">digon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it has two walls, one straight and one curved, or one that is shaped like <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terigon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a triangle, or one that is shaped like <span class="gemarra-regular">a pentagon, does</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not become susceptible to the ritual impurity of leprous spots. </span>If it is shaped like <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tetrigon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a quadrilateral, it <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes susceptible to the ritual impurity of leprous spots.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">states</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">above: </span>“If the plague be in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:37). The verse did not state: <span class="gemarra-regular">A wall, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">“walls,” </span>indicating that the house in question has at least <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> walls. And where it <span class="gemarra-regular">states below: </span>“If the plague has spread in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:39), instead of stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">A wall, </span>the verse states<span class="gemarra-regular"> “walls,” </span>indicating another <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> walls. There <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span> walls mentioned<span class="gemarra-regular"> here </span>in order to indicate that a house can become impure through leprous spots only if it has four sides.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">that came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, not realizing it was a folded document, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is no date on this </span>document, so it is not valid.<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, son of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the date is<span class="gemarra-regular"> hidden between its tied </span>folds. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi<span class="gemarra-regular"> opened it and saw </span>that the date was in fact between the tied folds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Afterward,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">looked at</span> his son <span class="gemarra-regular">disapprovingly, </span>as he held that one should not write a tied document. His son <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I did not write it; Rabbi Yehuda Ḥayyata wrote it. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> his son: <span class="gemarra-regular">Turn away</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Another<span class="gemarra-regular"> time,</span> Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">was sitting before</span> his father <span class="gemarra-regular">and reciting a section of the book of Psalms. Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">How straight</span> and neat is<span class="gemarra-regular"> this writing</span> in this book from which you are reading. Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I did not write it; Yehuda Ḥayyata wrote it.</span> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">told</span> his son: <span class="gemarra-regular">Turn away from </span>uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, there,</span> in the first episode,<span class="gemarra-regular"> there is malicious speech </span>involved, since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was displeased with the writer of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here,</span> in the second episode, <span class="gemarra-regular">what malicious speech is there?</span> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was complimenting the writer of the book of Psalms, not criticizing him. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi</span> teaches. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra, teaches: A person should never speak the praises of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as out of the praise </span>spoken about<span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>someone may<span class="gemarra-regular"> come to </span>speak to<span class="gemarra-regular"> his detriment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three sins</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from which a person is not spared each day.</span> They are: Having<span class="gemarra-regular"> sinful thoughts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> committing sins concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">deliberation in prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech.</span> The Gemara asks: Can it<span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind</span> that a person cannot go through the day without uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech?</span>

Daf 165a

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> Rav was referring to uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">a hint, </span>i.e., words with a bare trace, <span class="gemarra-regular">of malicious speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> The<span class="gemarra-regular"> majority </span>of people suc-cumb to sin <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to robbery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and a minority</span> of people succumb to sin <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to sexual matters,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and everyone</span> succumbs to sin <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech.</span> The Gemara asks: Can it<span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind</span> that all people sin <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">malicious speech?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> Rav was referring to uttering <span class="gemarra-regular">a hint</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of malicious speech.</span>
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to documents, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with regional custom.</span> The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does the first</span><span class="gemarra-italic"> tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accept</span> that one should follow the <span class="gemarra-regular">regional custom?</span> It is not reasonable that he would take issue with such a basic concept.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said</span> in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">In a place where the custom </span>is to write<span class="gemarra-regular"> an ordinary</span> document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> a scribe:<span class="gemarra-regular"> Make an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, and </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and<span class="gemarra-regular"> made a tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>it is assumed that he was <span class="gemarra-regular">particular</span> about wanting an ordinary document. Similarly, in a place where <span class="gemarra-regular">the custom </span>is to write <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">tied</span> document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> a scribe: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make a tied</span> document <span class="gemarra-regular">for me,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and<span class="gemarra-regular"> made an ordinary</span> document <span class="gemarra-regular">for him,</span> it is assumed that he was <span class="gemarra-regular">particular</span> about wanting a tied document. In both of these cases, the document is considered to have been written without the consent of the one who requested it. If it is a bill of divorce it may not be used, as a bill of divorce must be written with the knowledge and consent of the husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>is<span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place where the custom </span>is to write <span class="gemarra-regular">both an</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary</span> document<span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a tied</span> document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>a scribe: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">for me,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">went and made a tied </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">for him.</span> In such a case, one<span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that the one requesting the document was <span class="gemarra-regular">particular</span> about wanting an ordinary document, and since the scribe wrote a tied document, it is considered to have been written without his consent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one<span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that the one requesting the document was merely <span class="gemarra-regular">indicating </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">position</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the scribe, stating that if the scribe wanted to save himself the trouble of writing a tied document there would no objection.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Concerning<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar, they all hold</span> that when one gives instructions to an agent, he is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">indicating </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">position</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to him,</span> as opposed to expressing an insistence on certain details.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>holds this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we have </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">said. Rabbi Shimon </span>holds this as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 48a), as explained by the Gemara there, that the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> rules that if a woman appoints an agent to accept her betrothal money and tells him that the man will be giving a golden dinar, or that he will be giving a silver dinar, and he in fact gives the other type of dinar, the betrothal is not valid, as in accepting the wrong dinar the agent did not follow the woman’s instructions exactly.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: If he misled her to </span>her<span class="gemarra-regular"> advantage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he told her he was going to give a silver dinar and gave her a golden dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is betrothed. </span>When the woman told the agent to receive the silver dinar she did not mean to insist that the dinar be silver as opposed to gold, but was only indicating her position, which is that she would have no objection to receiving only a silver dinar.
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span> also holds this,<span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 65a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman who, </span>when designating her agent for receipt of her bill of divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to her agent: <span class="gemarra-regular">Receive my bill of divorce for m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in such and such a place, and he received it for her in another place, </span>the divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid; and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar deems </span>it<span class="gemarra-regular"> valid. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage,</span> the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that the woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">particular </span>that her instructions be followed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage,</span> Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that she was merely <span class="gemarra-regular">indicating </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">position to </span>the agent, informing him of where she thought her husband would be.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to<span class="gemarra-regular"> an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">in which</span> the signature of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single witness is written,</span> and a tied document in which the signatures of only two witnesses are written, they are both not valid. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> for the mishna to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">tied</span> document <span class="gemarra-regular">in which</span> the signatures of only <span class="gemarra-regular">two witnesses</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are written</span> is<span class="gemarra-regular"> not valid, </span>as it might<span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">generally</span> a document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid</span> with two signatures, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too </span>it is<span class="gemarra-regular"> valid;</span> therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid. But </span>why was it necessary to state that <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">in which</span> the signature of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single witness is written </span>is not valid; isn’t this<span class="gemarra-regular"> obvious?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It<span class="gemarra-regular"> is necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness</span> signed on the document <span class="gemarra-regular">in writing</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and, </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness</span> testifies <span class="gemarra-regular">orall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to the contents of the document, the document is not valid.
The Gemara relates:<span class="gemarra-regular"> Ameimar</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed</span> a document <span class="gemarra-regular">vali</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness</span> signed on the document <span class="gemarra-regular">in writing</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness</span> testifying <span class="gemarra-regular">orally</span> to the contents of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And what of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>which deemed such a document invalid? Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not hear</span> of it, as though <span class="gemarra-regular">to say:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not hold</span> like it; I disagree with Abaye.
Rav Ashi asks:<span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if you disagree, the <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty</span>

Daf 165b

with <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna</span> remains: Why does the mishna state that which is obvious, that a document with a single witness’s signature is not valid?
The Gemara answers that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses signed <span class="gemarra-regular">on a tied </span>document is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness</span> signed <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary</span> document: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">there,</span> in the case of a single witness signed on an ordinary document, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualification</span> is<span class="gemarra-regular"> by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too here, </span>in the case of two witnesses signed on a tied document, <span class="gemarra-regular">the disqualification</span> is<span class="gemarra-regular"> by Torah law.</span>
Ameimar added: <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that the signature of one witness on a document and the oral testimony of one person about it can be combined into a single testimony,<span class="gemarra-regular"> as the colleagues </span>of the academy <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a question <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yirmey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> seeking clarification of a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that the testimony of two witnesses to an event can be combined into a single testimony only if both of them witnessed the event together, while Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa holds that the testimony can be combined even if they saw the event one after the other. Furthermore, the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that their testimony is accepted only if they both testify together. By contrast, Rabbi Natan holds that the testimony of one witness may be accepted today, and when the other witness comes the next day his testimony may be accepted, and the two testimonies may thereby be combined.
The dilemma they posed to Rabbi Yirmeya was this: In the case of a loan for which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness in writing, </span>signed on a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">witness </span>who testifies to the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">orally, what</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha </span>with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the two of them <span class="gemarra-regular">will combine </span>to testify as two witnesses?
The dilemma is clarified:<span class="gemarra-regular"> According to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who engages in a dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">you should not raise the dilemma,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> according to his opinion there are situations where <span class="gemarra-regular">even two</span> testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">in writing or two oral </span>testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">are not combined</span> into a single testimony. All the more so they are not combined when one is written and one is oral. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">when should you raise the dilemma?</span> Raise it<span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the opinion<span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa.</span> The dilemma is: Is it only testimonies of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">in writing or two</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">oral</span> witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">that are combined</span> into a single testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">but we do not combine </span>testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness in writing and one orally?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>between these cases.
Rabbi Yirmeya humbly <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>back his response <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the colleagues of the academy:<span class="gemarra-regular"> I am not worthy</span> of being the recipient of the query <span class="gemarra-regular">that you sent to me.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">But this</span> is how <span class="gemarra-regular">the opinion of your student, </span>i.e., himself,<span class="gemarra-regular"> leans:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>the testimonies<span class="gemarra-regular"> should be combined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This exchange between Rabbi Yirmeya and his questioners indicates that Ameimar’s opinion is accepted.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> Ameimar: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach</span> this entire incident with Rabbi Yirmeya differently, <span class="gemarra-regular">as follows: That the colleagues </span>of the academy <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>this question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yirmeya: </span>If there are<span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">testified,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in this court and one in that court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the judges of one <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">could come</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> in this manner the two testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">will be combined </span>to become a valid testimony of two witnesses?
The dilemma is clarified:<span class="gemarra-regular"> According to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who also engages in a dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Natan,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">you should not raise the dilemma,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> according to his opinion, testimonies that are not given concurrently <span class="gemarra-regular">are not combined</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even in one court;</span> all the more so when they are given in two different courts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">when should you raise the dilemma?</span> Raise it<span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the opinion<span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Natan. </span>The dilemma is: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in one court that </span>the two separate testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">are combined, but </span>when they are given <span class="gemarra-regular">in two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">courts they are not combined? Or perhaps</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">sent</span> back his response <span class="gemarra-regular">to them: I am not worthy</span> of being the recipient of the query <span class="gemarra-regular">that you sent to me.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>is how <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">opinion of your student leans: That they</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should be combined.</span> According to this version of the exchange between Rabbi Yirmeya and his questioners there is no relevance to Ameimar’s statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Ḥiyya said</span> yet a third version, that the dilemma the colleagues of the academy <span class="gemarra-regular">sent to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya is<span class="gemarra-regular"> as follows: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">who testified in this court and then</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">testified in that court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that one </span>judge would <span class="gemarra-regular">come</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from each court </span>to one location and relate the testimony he had heard to the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> in this manner the two testimonies <span class="gemarra-regular">will be combined?</span>
The dilemma is clarified:<span class="gemarra-regular"> According to </span>the opinion<span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Natan you should not raise the dilemma. Now</span> that he maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">we combine</span> two individual <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to ask if <span class="gemarra-regular">judges</span> may be combined in this manner? They certainly can be combined. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">when should you raise the dilemma?</span> Raise it<span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the opinion<span class="gemarra-regular"> of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who engages in a dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Natan. </span>The dilemma is:<span class="gemarra-regular"> Is</span> it only testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses that we do not combine</span> into a single testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">but we do combine judges</span> from two different courts? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference.</span>
Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">sent</span> back his response <span class="gemarra-regular">to them:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I am not worthy</span> of being the recipient of the query <span class="gemarra-regular">that you sent to me.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">But this is</span> how <span class="gemarra-regular">the opinion of your student leans:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">That they should be combined.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said</span> a fourth version, that the dilemma the colleagues of the academy <span class="gemarra-regular">sent to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya is<span class="gemarra-regular"> as follows: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>judges <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sat</span> as a court <span class="gemarra-regular">to ratify a document,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and,</span> after verifying the signatures of the witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">died, must they </span>mention this in their statement of ratification, to account for why the declaration is signed by only two judges, and<span class="gemarra-regular"> write: We were sitting in </span>a group of<span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>judges,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and one of </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>longer alive? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or</span> perhaps they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> required to write this.
Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">sent</span> back his response <span class="gemarra-regular">to them: I am not worthy</span> of being the recipient of the query <span class="gemarra-regular">that you sent to me. But this is</span> how<span class="gemarra-regular"> the opinion of your student leans:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">That they are required to write: We were sitting in </span>a group of<span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>judges,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and one of </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>longer alive.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was<span class="gemarra-regular"> because of this</span> fitting answer, to whichever version of the dilemma that is adopted, that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">brought</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">into the study hall </span>after he had been expelled, as related earlier in this tractate (23b).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written in</span> a document that someone owes: <span class="gemarra-regular">One hundred dinars, which ar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twenty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is internally inconsistent since there are twenty-five <span class="it-text">sela</span> in a hundred dinars, the holder of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to claim <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>, the lower of the two amounts. If it is written that he owes: <span class="gemarra-regular">One hundred dinars, which are thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the holder of the document<span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>the right to claim <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">dinars,</span> again the lower of the two amounts.
If it is written that someone owes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Silver dinars that are,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the remainder of the text, where the number of dinars should be specified, <span class="gemarra-regular">was erased</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two</span> dinars, the lowest amount to which the plural word dinars can be referring. That is what the creditor can claim. Similarly, if it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Silver </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that are, and</span> the remainder of the text <span class="gemarra-regular">was erased,</span> the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>. And if it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Darics</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that are, and</span> the remainder of the text <span class="gemarra-regular">was erased,</span> the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two</span> darics.
If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written in </span>the document<span class="gemarra-regular"> above, </span>in an earlier place in the document, that someone owes <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and below,</span> toward the end of the document, it is written that the amount owed is <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>it is written <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred</span> dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and below one hundred dinars,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">everything follows the bottom</span> amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span> does one <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>the information in <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper</span> part of the document at all?

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:2): If a document <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>that someone owes <span class="gemarra-regular">silver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without specifying which silver coin, the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">silver dinar. </span>If it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Silver dinars, or: Dinars silver, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two silver dinars, </span>the lowest amount to which that phrase can refer. If it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Silver, in dinars, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two golden dinars’ </span>worth of<span class="gemarra-regular"> silver.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the beginning of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says:</span> If a document states that someone owes <span class="gemarra-regular">silver,</span> without specifying which silver coin, the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">silver dinar. </span>The Gemara asks:<span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>why not<span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the intention of the word silver is not to a coin at all, but to a small <span class="gemarra-regular">piece</span> of silver? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the word <span class="gemarra-regular">coin is written</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the document. The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not<span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the intent is not a dinar, but smaller coins, such as <span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a place</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">silver</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not circulate.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If it is written in a document that someone owes <span class="gemarra-regular">gold,</span> the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than a golden dinar. </span>If it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Golden dinars, or: Dinars golden, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two golden dinars. </span>If it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gold, in dinars, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two silver dinars’ </span>worth of<span class="gemarra-regular"> gold.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the beginning of this section of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says:</span> If it is written in a document that someone owes <span class="gemarra-regular">gold,</span> the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than a golden dinar. </span>The Gemara asks: But why not<span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the intention of the word gold is not to a coin at all, but to a small <span class="gemarra-regular">piece</span> of gold? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the word <span class="gemarra-regular">coin is written</span> in the document.

Daf 166a

The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the intent is not a dinar, but smaller coins, such as <span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">People do not make </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of gold.</span>
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: If it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gold, in dinars, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two silver dinars’ </span>worth of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the document <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">two golden dinars’ </span>worth of <span class="gemarra-regular">pieces of gold? Abaye says: </span>This interpretation is also possible, but the guiding principle in all interpretations of ambiguities is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the holder of the document </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">at a disadvantage.</span>
The Gemara asks a question from <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches </span>that if the document states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Silver in dinars, </span>the amount must be <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than two golden dinars’ </span>worth of <span class="gemarra-regular">silver. Why </span>is he entitled to so much? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the document <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">silver </span>only, and means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two silver dinars’ </span>worth of silver <span class="gemarra-regular">pieces. </span>This interpretation would be a lower value than the interpretation assigned to it by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and would be in keeping with the principle that the holder of the document is at a disadvantage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>in reply that the text of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote: </span>Silver in dinars, using the plural form <span class="gemarra-italic">dinarei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which refers specifically to golden dinars. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause, </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote: </span>Gold in dinars, using the plural form <span class="gemarra-italic">dinarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which denotes silver dinars specifically.
The Gemara supports its assertion that there is a difference between these two plural forms: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difference between </span>the words <span class="gemarra-italic">dinarei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dinarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Karetot</span> 8a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman for whom there was uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five births</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and likewise a woman for whom there was <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>irregular <span class="gemarra-regular">discharges </span>of blood from the uterus [<span class="it-text">ziva</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">she brings one offering, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she may partake of </span>the meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings. And the remaining </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are not an obligation for her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If she <span class="gemarra-regular">has in her </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">five definite births </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">five definite discharges of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, she brings one offering, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she may partake of </span>the meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings. And the remaining </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are an obligation for her.</span>
That mishna continues: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where </span>the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">nests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., pairs of birds, <span class="gemarra-regular">stood in Jerusalem at golden </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dinarei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the great demand for birds for the offerings of a woman after childbirth and a <span class="it-text">zava</span> led to an increase in the price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: </span>I take an oath by <span class="gemarra-regular">this abode </span>of the Divine Presence that <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not lie </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">tonight until </span>the price of nests <span class="gemarra-regular">will be in</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">dinarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Ultimately, <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered the court and taught: A woman for whom there were five definite births </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">five definite discharges of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings one offering, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she may partake of </span>the meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings. And the remaining </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are not an obligation for her. </span>

Daf 166b

The mishna concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as a result, the price of the <span class="gemarra-regular">nests stood that day at one-quarter </span>of a silver dinar, as the demand for nests decreased. It is clear in the mishna that the term <span class="it-text">dinarei</span> indicates a higher value than the term <span class="it-text">dinarin</span>.
§ The mishna teaches: If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the document <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>that someone owes one hundred dinars, and below it is written two hundred dinars, or if above it is written two hundred and below one hundred, everything follows the bottom amount. If so, why does one write the information in the upper part of the document at all? It is a safety measure, so that if one letter is erased from the lower part of the document, thereby rendering it illegible, the information can be learned from the upper part of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:4): Information concerning what is written <span class="gemarra-regular">below may be learned from </span>what is written <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>if the lower text is missing <span class="gemarra-regular">one letter, but not </span>if it is missing <span class="gemarra-regular">two letters. </span>In that case, in the event of a discrepancy between information written above and information written below, the document is not valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>if the name of one party is written as <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan </span>below and Ḥanani above, it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanani </span>written above that the party is named Ḥanani. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, if a name is written <span class="gemarra-regular">Anan </span>below, it may be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the name <span class="gemarra-regular">Anani </span>written above that the party is named Anani.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">two letters </span>missing, that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the name written below <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be corrected from the name written above? The Gemara suggests: It is out of concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it will <span class="gemarra-regular">occur </span>by chance that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a four-letter name, and </span>the omission of two letters <span class="gemarra-regular">would be half of the name, </span>and for this reason the Sages extended this concern to all cases where two letters are missing. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the same could be said when <span class="gemarra-regular">one letter </span>is missing <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it will <span class="gemarra-regular">occur </span>by chance that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a two-letter name, and </span>the omission of one letter <span class="gemarra-regular">would be half of the name.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is the reason </span>that when <span class="gemarra-regular">two letters </span>are missing the name written below cannot be corrected from the name written above: The concern is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it will <span class="gemarra-regular">occur </span>by chance that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a three-letter name, and </span>the omission of two letters <span class="gemarra-regular">would be a majority of the name. </span>The Sages applied this concern to all cases where two letters are missing.
The Gemara continues to discuss discrepancies between the information written above and below in a document. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that if a document states <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>that one owes <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of cup, <span class="gemarra-regular">and below </span>it states <span class="gemarra-italic">kefel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">everything is determined by the </span>information written <span class="gemarra-regular">below. </span>In this case there is not a missing letter at the bottom but an altered letter. Therefore, the information written below is not corrected from the information written above.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What </span>if it is stated <span class="gemarra-italic">kefel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> above and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The difference between the two words is that the former begins with <span class="it-text">kuf</span>, whereas the latter begins with <span class="it-text">samekh</span>. The orthographical difference between these two letters is a single stroke that extends downward, as the omission of the extension of this stroke would change <span class="it-text">kuf</span> into <span class="it-text">samekh</span>. Rav Pappa’s dilemma is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we concerned for </span>the possibility that <span class="gemarra-regular">a fly </span>landed on the stroke of the <span class="it-text">kuf</span>, removing the ink and changing it into <span class="it-text">samekh</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>are we <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>concerned with this possibility? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it was written </span>that the amount due was <span class="gemarra-regular">six hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a dinar, </span>without specifying to which denomination the six hundred amount referred. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sherevya sent </span>this question <span class="gemarra-regular">before Abaye: </span>Does the holder of the document collect <span class="gemarra-regular">six hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">istira</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a dinar? </span><span class="it-text">Istira</span> is another name for a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, which equals four dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>entitled to collect only <span class="gemarra-regular">six hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and a dinar, </span>a <span class="it-text">peruta</span> being a small fraction of a dinar? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Remove </span>the possibility of six hundred <span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not write </span>large numbers of <span class="it-text">perutot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a document, as they </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">combine them </span>into larger denominations

Daf 167a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and change them </span>into a smaller number of <span class="gemarra-regular">dinars. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can you say? </span>The highest and lowest remaining possibilities are: <span class="gemarra-regular">Six hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">istira</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a dinar, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">six hundred dinars and one </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar. </span>The guiding principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the holder of the document </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">at a disadvantage,</span> and the lesser of these two values is assumed.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who needs to show his signatur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in court </span>for the purpose of corroborating his signature on a document, he <span class="gemarra-regular">should not show </span>it by writing it <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of the parchment, lest another, </span>unscrupulous, person <span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>the parchment <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span>above the signature <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the signatory <span class="gemarra-regular">owes him money. And </span>such a document would be valid, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned</span> in a mishna (175b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">presents to </span>a debtor a document in the <span class="gemarra-regular">handwriting of </span>the debtor stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that he owes </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., property that is currently in the possession of the debtor.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>Jewish <span class="gemarra-regular">tax collector who came before Abaye </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let the Master show me his signature </span>on a piece of paper to keep in my records, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when rabbis come </span>to me and <span class="gemarra-regular">show me </span>a note with your signature on it, attesting to the fact that they are Torah scholars, <span class="gemarra-regular">I let them pass without</span> paying the <span class="gemarra-regular">tax. Abaye showed him </span>his signature <span class="gemarra-regular">at the top of the parchment, </span>though the unscrupulous tax collector kept <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling </span>the parchment away from Abaye so that the signature would be at the bottom. Abaye noticed this and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Sages </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">already anticipated </span>people such as <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>and advised that one should never write his signature at the bottom of a paper.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>When writing a promissory note, one <span class="gemarra-regular">should not write </span>any number <span class="gemarra-regular">from three until ten at the end of a line, lest </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">commit forgery and write </span>an extension to the number, since it is at the end of the line. In Hebrew and Aramaic, the words for the numbers three through nine can be changed to thirty through ninety, respectively, by appending to them the suffix <span class="it-text">in</span>, written with the letters <span class="it-text">yod</span> and <span class="it-text">nun</span>. Ten can be changed to twenty in a similar manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>by chance <span class="gemarra-regular">it occurs for him </span>that these numbers fall out at the end of a line, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should repeat his words two </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">three times, </span>stating and restating the agreement in question, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is impossible that </span>the number will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">occur for him in the middle of a line. </span>When there is a contradiction, it is the final mention of the amount that is authoritative, as the mishna teaches.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it was written </span>that the item sold was: In my garden, <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of the orchard. </span>The purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">erased the roof and the foot of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> of the term: Of the orchard [<span class="it-text">befardeisa</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">changed </span>the prefix <span class="it-text">beit</span> into a <span class="it-text">vav</span>, yielding: In my garden one-third, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the orchard [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufardeisa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>indicating that the sale included one-third of the garden in addition to all of the orchard. The document <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Abaye, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the purchaser: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">so much space around this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Since the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span> is narrower than the letter <span class="it-text">beit</span>, a larger space between letters emerged as compared to the spacing of letters in the rest of the document. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">bound </span>the purchaser, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the forgery.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it was written </span>that the item being sold was: <span class="gemarra-regular">The portions of Reuven and Shimon, brothers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Reuven and Shimon happened to <span class="gemarra-regular">have a brother </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose name </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥai, </span>which, when writing without vowels, is spelled identically to <span class="it-text">aḥei</span>. The purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a conjunctive <span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the document before the word <span class="it-text">aḥei</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and changed </span>the wording into: The portions of Reuven and Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">and Aḥai. </span>The document <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Abaye, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the purchaser: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so crowded around this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>By inserting the extra <span class="it-text">vav</span>, a smaller space between letters emerged as compared to the spacing of letters in the rest of the document. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">bound </span>the purchaser, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admitted </span>the forgery.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain document upon which </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava and Rav Aḥa bar Add</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were signed. </span>The one holding the document <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is my signature, but I never signed </span>any document <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Aḥa bar Adda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">bound </span>the holder of the document, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admitted </span>the forgery. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Granted, you </span>were able to <span class="gemarra-regular">forge my </span>signature, <span class="gemarra-regular">but how did you perform </span>a forgery of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Adda’s </span>signature, <span class="gemarra-regular">since his hands shake</span> and as a result his signature is distinctive? The man <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I placed my hands on </span>the rope of <span class="gemarra-regular">a narrow footbridge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amitzra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and was thereby able to duplicate Rav Aḥa’s signature. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say</span> that the forgery was accomplished when the forger <span class="gemarra-regular">stood upon a </span>wobbly <span class="gemarra-regular">water skin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">azarnuka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wrote </span>the signature.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">write a bill of divorce for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who requests one, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if his wife is not with him </span>to give her consent when he presents his request, as there is no possibility that he will misuse the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a scribe may write <span class="gemarra-regular">a receipt for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> upon her request, attesting to the payment of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if her husband is not with her </span>to give his consent. This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">recognizes </span>the parties requesting the document, to prevent misrepresentation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for both documents, <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband gives </span>the scribe his <span class="gemarra-regular">wages</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">recognizes </span>the parties requesting the document? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he recognizes the man’s name in the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bill of divorce and the woman’s name in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the receipt.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rav Aḥa bar Huna and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting, and Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting near them. And </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">they were sitting, they raised a dilemma: </span>Did Rav mean that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the man’s name in the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of divorce bill, yes, </span>it must be known to the scribe, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman’s name </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be known to the scribe? And did he mean that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman’s name in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the receipt, yes, </span>it must be known to the scribe, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the man’s name </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be known to the scribe?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the man who made the request <span class="gemarra-regular">writes the bill of divorce and </span>intends to <span class="gemarra-regular">go and give it to the wife of another </span>man with the same name.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, in the case of the receipt let there be a concern that there will be <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when the <span class="gemarra-regular">woman writes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">receipt and </span>intends to <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a man who is not her </span>husband, whose wife shares her name.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to them: </span>You are not understanding Rav’s statement correctly. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: The man’s name in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bill of divorce </span>must be known to the scribe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true of the woman’s name, </span>which must also be known to the scribe. And <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman’s name in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the receipt </span>must be known to the scribe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true of the man’s name, </span>which must also be known to the scribe.
They continued their line of questioning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even if both names are known to the scribe, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern for </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>men with the same name, such as two men named <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef ben Shimon, who live in one cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and whose wives share the same name as well, and <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the man who made the request will <span class="gemarra-regular">write the bill of divorce and </span>intend to <span class="gemarra-regular">go and give it to the wife of the other </span>man who bears the same name as him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Huna said to them </span>in reply that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>men named <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef ben Shimon who live in one city </span>and are married to women who share the same name, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may divorce their wives only in the presence of one another.</span>
They continued to ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even if the scribe knows the man’s name and the name of the man’s wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>someone will <span class="gemarra-regular">go to another city and establish </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">name for himself as Yosef ben Shimon, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">will write the bill of divorce and give it to the wife of the other </span>man, whose name really is Yosef ben Shimon.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone whose name has been established in a city </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no concern </span>harbored <span class="gemarra-regular">about him </span>that his name is false. It is assumed that this is his true name.
They continued to ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> if his name has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>been <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>for thirty days? How can a newcomer in a town have a bill of divorce drawn up for him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">call him </span>by the name he claims for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and he respond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to that call. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: A liar is careful about </span>upholding <span class="gemarra-regular">his lies, </span>and just because he responds to being called by a particular name does not prove he is telling the truth. A newcomer would therefore have to wait thirty days before requesting that a scribe write him a bill of divorce.
§ There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain receipt </span>of payment of a marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was signed </span>as a witness. <span class="gemarra-regular">That woman, </span>whose name matched the name on the receipt, <span class="gemarra-regular">came before </span>Rav Yirmeya, seeking to collect payment of her marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya recognized her name, but not her appearance. The woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It was not I </span>whose name was on the receipt that you signed, but another woman with the same name; I have not collected payment of my marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I, too, said to </span>the other witnesses signed on the document: The woman for whom we signed the receipt <span class="gemarra-regular">is not she. But they said to me: </span>It is in fact the same woman, but <span class="gemarra-regular">she has aged and her voice has matured </span>and changed, and that is why you do not recognize her.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">although the Sages said: </span>

Daf 168a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">has stated </span>his testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not then state a revision, </span>this case of Rav Yirmeya is an exception, and he can retract his initial statement in which he supported the woman’s claim. The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not the manner of a Torah scholar to be carefu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> about identifying women, for reasons of modesty.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain receipt </span>of payment for a marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was signed.</span> A woman whose name appeared on the receipt, who was seeking to collect payment of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It was not I, </span>but another woman with the same name, who had this receipt written. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: But it was you, </span>and you are lying now. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Although </span>I said that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not the manner of a Torah scholar to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">careful </span>about identifying women, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he is careful </span>about such an identification and states positively that he recognizes a particular woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is careful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: A Torah scholar who goes to betroth a woman should take an ignoramus with him </span>to establish a positive identity of the woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange </span>another woman for <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>when given to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>for marriage, taking advantage of his innocence.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband gives </span>the scribe’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wages </span>for writing a bill of divorce. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span> for this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As the verse states: </span>“When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter in her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall write </span>her a scroll of severance <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). It is therefore the husband’s responsibility to have the bill of divorce written. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But today, </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not do so, </span>but instead have the woman pay the scribe, is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages placed </span>the burden <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">should not delay </span>the divorce by refusing to pay the scribe.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for a debtor </span>who requests one, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor is not with him, </span>and it is the debtor who gives the scribe his wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the debtor pays the wages? After all, he is the beneficiary of the loan. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to state this, as there are times when the loan is beneficial to the creditor as well, as <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a joint venture, </span>where the creditor receives a share of the profits engendered by the money provided to the borrower (see <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 104a).
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">write a bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for a seller </span>of property who requests one, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the purchaser is not with him </span>when he presents his request, and it is the purchaser who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the purchaser pays the wages? After all, he is the beneficiary of the sale. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to state this, as sometimes the sale is beneficial to the seller as well, as <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a field because of its poor </span>quality, as he is anxious to be rid of it.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write documents of betrothal </span>and documents of marriage except with the consent of both the groom and the bride, and it is the groom who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the groom pays the wages? After all, he is the one acquiring his betrothed. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to state this, to teach us <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when the groom is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">it gives his father-in-law satisfaction to bring him into his family </span>by having him marry his daughter. Even in such a case, where the bride’s family is a beneficiary, it is the groom who pays the wages.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write contracts for sharecroppers and contractors </span>except with the consent of both parties, i.e., the sharecropper or contractor and the one who hires him, and it is the sharecropper or contractor who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the contractor pays the wages? After all, the contract details his rights to the field. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to state this, as sometimes the deal is detrimental to the contractor, as <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fallow</span> field. It might have been thought that in this case the cost of the document is borne by the landowner.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">documents </span>testifying to <span class="gemarra-regular">arbitration </span>or any other court enactment <span class="gemarra-regular">except with the consent of both </span>parties to the litigation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">documents </span>testifying to <span class="gemarra-regular">arbitration? Here </span>in Babylonia the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted</span> it to mean <span class="gemarra-regular">documents recording the claim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the two parties to the litigation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</span> A document testifying to arbitration is one that records the procedure in which the composition of the court is chosen, as described in tractate <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> (23a), whereby <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>litigant <span class="gemarra-regular">chooses one </span>judge <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>litigant <span class="gemarra-regular">chooses one </span>judge, and these two judges choose the third one.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>The scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">writes two</span> documents <span class="gemarra-regular">for the two </span>parties, one <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">by himself and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">by himself. </span>The Gemara analyzes the disagreement between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, who did not call for two separate documents: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the principle that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">coerces </span>people to prevent <span class="gemarra-regular">conduct</span> characteristic <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sodom, </span>i.e., selfish behavior? That is, the case is where one of the litigants does not want to contribute to the writing of a joint document, and insists that each litigant pay to have his own document written, which would entail an additional expenditure on the part of the other party.
The dispute is then as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">coerces </span>people to prevent this conduct, so the obstinate litigant is forced to pay his share of a joint document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coerce </span>people to prevent this conduct, and a litigant can insist upon paying only for a document of his own.
The Gemara rejects this analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>in the mishna holds that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">coerces </span>people to prevent conduct characteristic of Sodom, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is the reason </span>for the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: </span>It is because the litigant demanding separate documents is not making a pointless, selfish request at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he says to </span>the other litigant: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not amenable for me that your defense, </span>i.e., the record of your claims, <span class="gemarra-regular">should be together with my defense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as you are to me like an ambushing lion, </span>i.e., our interests are in conflict.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who repaid part of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with the agreement of the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">deposited </span>the promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note with a third party </span>serving as a trustee to ensure that the creditor would not collect the full amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the trustee: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I have not given you </span>the balance <span class="gemarra-regular">from now until such and such a day, give </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>thereby enabling him to collect the full amount stated on the note, if the stipulated <span class="gemarra-regular">time arrived and </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give </span>the balance to the trustee, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says:</span> The trustee <span class="gemarra-regular">should give </span>the promissory note to the creditor, in accordance with the debtor’s stipulation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The trustee <span class="gemarra-regular">should not give </span>it, as the stipulation is void.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction with inconclusive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">effects acquisition. </span>In this case, the debtor willingly undertook a penalty if he would not repay the remainder of the debt on time. Yet, he did not think that he would miss the deadline and be held accountable to pay that penalty. Rabbi Yosei holds that he is nevertheless bound by his word. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquisition, </span>i.e., it is not binding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. When </span>questioners <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ami, </span>inquiring of him what the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in this matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: But since </span>it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan taught us a first time and a second </span>time, i.e., repeatedly, that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, what can I do </span>to contradict his words?
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in fact the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>i.e., an <span class="it-text">asmakhta</span> is not binding.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">whose promissory note</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has become erased, </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">produce witnesses </span>who remember the details of the document to testify <span class="gemarra-regular">about it. And </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">come before the court, and they ratify </span>his promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>stating: The promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note of so-and-so was erased, </span>and it stated that a loan for such and such an amount took place <span class="gemarra-regular">on such and such a date, </span>

Daf 168b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and so-and-so and so-and-so were its witnesses. </span>The ratification document is signed, and it may be used as a replacement for the erased document.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 1:16): <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the text of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ratification </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>an erased document? The court writes as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We, so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so, were sitting as three </span>judges, and <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so, son of so-and-so, produced an erased document before us, </span>which was written <span class="gemarra-regular">on such and such a date, and so-and-so and so-and-so </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses. And if it is written in </span>this ratification document also: <span class="gemarra-regular">We engaged in </span>the investigation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the testimony of the witnesses and their testimony has been found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">congruent, </span>the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>his debt on the basis of this ratification document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not need to bring </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">proof. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>this formula is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>written, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to bring </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span>of the loan in order to collect it.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues with its discussion of damaged documents: If a promissory note was <span class="gemarra-regular">torn </span>intentionally it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid, </span>but if it <span class="gemarra-regular">became torn </span>accidentally it is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>In a case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">was erase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or smudged, if its imprint is recognizable, </span>i.e., if the words are still legible, though barely, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara seeks to clarify the terms in the second part of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances, </span>i.e., what are the defining characteristics, of a document that was <span class="gemarra-regular">torn, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances </span>of a document that <span class="gemarra-regular">became torn? Rav Yehuda says: </span>A document that was <span class="gemarra-regular">torn </span>means that it had <span class="gemarra-regular">a tear </span>created <span class="gemarra-regular">by the court, </span>because they wished to render it not valid due to payment of the loan or some other circumstance. A document that <span class="gemarra-regular">became torn </span>means it had <span class="gemarra-regular">a tear that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>created <span class="gemarra-regular">by the court.</span>
The Gemara seeks further clarification: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances, </span>i.e., what are the signs, of a document that had <span class="gemarra-regular">a tear </span>created <span class="gemarra-regular">by the court? Rav Yehuda says: </span>The document has a tear that ruins <span class="gemarra-regular">the place of the witnesses’</span> signatures <span class="gemarra-regular">and the place of the date and the place of the essential part </span>of a document. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>It has <span class="gemarra-regular">a tear </span>that goes both <span class="gemarra-regular">lengthwise and widthwise.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>group of <span class="gemarra-regular">Arabs who came to Pumbedita </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">who would rob people’s land </span>and force the victims to surrender the deeds to their property to prevent subsequent legal action. <span class="gemarra-regular">The owners of </span>land who had not yet had fallen victim to these Arabs <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Abaye </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let the Master look at our deeds </span>to our property <span class="gemarra-regular">and let the Master write us another deed for it, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that if one </span>of the deeds <span class="gemarra-regular">is robbed we will have </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one in our possession.</span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: What can I do for you? </span>I cannot comply with your request, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Safra says: </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two deeds </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">for one field, lest </span>the owner of that land <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess property</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">go back and repossess </span>it once again. Generally, whenever real estate is sold there is a guarantee given to the purchaser in the event that the land is repossessed by the seller’s creditor or by someone else who proves that the land rightfully belongs to him. If the seller of the repossessed land has no money to honor the guarantee, the purchaser can repossess property from others who had purchased property from the same seller subsequent to the sale of the repossessed land. In order to do so, he would have to produce the bill of sale proving that he had purchased the repossessed property. If he has two such deeds, he would be able to collect payment twice. To eliminate this possibility, duplicate property deeds are not written.
The landowners <span class="gemarra-regular">kept badgering </span>Abaye to write the duplicate documents, until, in order to be rid of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to his scribe: Go write </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">for them, </span>but first write on paper and then erase it, and then write the desired document over the erased text, so that the text of the document will be written <span class="gemarra-regular">over an erasure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">its witnesses </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>a part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the paper </span>where the writing had not been erased, a situation in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said to Abaye: But perhaps </span>the first writing on the paper was not erased thoroughly, so <span class="gemarra-regular">its imprint is recognizable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that in a case where the writing on a document <span class="gemarra-regular">was erased or smudged, if its imprint is recognizable, </span>the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did I say </span>that he should write <span class="gemarra-regular">a proper document </span>and then erase it? <span class="gemarra-regular">I said, </span>i.e., I intended, that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>write letters of the <span class="gemarra-regular">alphabet [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>not actual words.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: My promissory note was lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if witnesses said: We wrote and signed</span> such a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>this man, the court may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write </span>a new <span class="gemarra-regular">document for him. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">documents </span>detailing <span class="gemarra-regular">loans.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds of buying and selling </span>land, the court may <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>a replacement document, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding the </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the first document, which states that if the field is repossessed the seller will compensate the purchaser for his loss. 

Daf 169a

The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>The court may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write </span>a replacement document <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds of buying and selling </span>land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says as well: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives a gift </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, and </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">returned the deed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him, his gift </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>to him as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: His gift </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>in the possession of the recipient.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to deeds of buying and selling land, the court may write a replacement document, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding the guarantee that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the first document. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the guarantee may not be written?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the court may <span class="gemarra-regular">not write two deeds </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the same sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">one field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lest a creditor </span>of the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>the field sold <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">go and take out one </span>deed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in accordance with the guarantee clause of the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>land from other <span class="gemarra-regular">purchasers </span>who purchased land from the same seller at a later date, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to the creditor: Remain quiet [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> about this matter for a few years, <span class="gemarra-regular">while I become established in </span>the property I repossessed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And then, come </span>and claim your loan again, and then you will <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>this property <span class="gemarra-regular">from me. And </span>then, after it is taken from him a second time, the purchaser will then <span class="gemarra-regular">take out the other </span>document of sale, the replacement that the court had written for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>land from <span class="gemarra-regular">other purchasers </span>who purchased land from the same seller. In short, a replacement document with a guarantee will enable double collection on that guarantee.
The Gemara asks with regard to Rav Safra’s scenario: How would it be possible for this to occur? <span class="gemarra-regular">But once </span>the creditor repossessed the land the first time as payment of the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">we, </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">tore the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note of </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor; with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>document could the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>the purchaser’s land <span class="gemarra-regular">again?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that we did not tear </span>the creditor’s promissory note in the course of the first collection, that cannot be. <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization to repossess </span>liened property from its purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it is not written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> We have torn the creditor’s </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, is not </span>a valid document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repossess </span>liened property; <span class="gemarra-regular">and any document of authorization </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>seize a debtor’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it is not written: We have torn the</span> creditor’s document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization to repossess </span>liened property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">document of authorization; and any document of appraisal </span>of an article’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">in which it is not written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> We have torn </span>the creditor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">document of authorization, is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">document of appraisal.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to explain Rav Safra’s case as follows: The concern is not that a creditor will repossess the field, but <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>someone will <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to repossess it <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>his claim to the land as the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ancestors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, he proved that the field had belonged to his ancestors, and by extension belongs to himself as their heir, and the one who sold the field was in fact a thief. It was for this reason that he repossessed the field from the purchaser, and the concern is that the purchaser will seek reimbursement, as stipulated in the guarantee, from other property sold subsequently by the seller. If the purchaser has two deeds of sale with guarantees, he can collect payment twice.
The Gemara presents another question pertaining to Rav Safra’s case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And why did </span>Rav Safra have <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>include in his case that the purchaser will <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Remain quiet </span>about this matter for a few years <span class="gemarra-regular">while I become established in this land </span>I repossessed, and then come and claim your loan again? Why did he devise a case in which the seller’s creditor collects payment twice? Let the problem <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that since </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">holds two deeds</span> he will be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>land based on his guarantee once <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">repossess </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">again, </span>even if the creditor does not collect his debt twice.
Ravina answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the purchaser attempts to repossess land twice based on a single repossession of the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will have </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">many litigants </span>to deal with at once, and his dishonest dealings will be discovered.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">write a proper bill </span>of sale, one that includes a guarantee, <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">write a receipt for the seller, </span>stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">All documents that are issued with regard to </span>the purchase of <span class="gemarra-regular">this field are not valid, except for </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">issued on this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> date, </span>referring to the replacement document written by the court. This will prevent double collection, as if the purchaser attempts to collect on his guarantee with a second document, the seller will foil this attempt by showing this receipt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis said before Rav Pappa </span>in response to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it was said <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Ashi: Is that to say </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that in general the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not write a receip</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in such cases? 

Daf 169b

Rav Pappa or Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>them: Do not draw this conclusion. It is possible that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">generally </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt </span>when a creditor has lost his promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, this is the reason </span>that it does not write a receipt: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the creditor, </span>i.e., the one from whom the property was stolen, will <span class="gemarra-regular">go and repossess </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchaser </span>who bought the stolen land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the purchaser, seeking reimbursement in accordance with the guarantee, will <span class="gemarra-regular">go and repossess </span>property from other <span class="gemarra-regular">purchasers </span>who had later bought property from the same seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the receipt </span>will not help, because it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not with the purchasers </span>who bought property from the seller, but is in the possession of the seller himself. The purchasers, who are the ones who will suffer from the double collection, have no protection; they will in fact not even be aware that they are the victims of a double collection.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, don’t </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">purchasers go back to the owner, </span>i.e., the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">of the land </span>to demand reimbursement? At that point the seller will produce the receipt, exposing the double collection, and the entire process will be reversed, so that ultimately the purchaser who suffered from the unjust collection will obtain possession of his property.
The Gemara answers: While it is true that ultimately the deception will be discovered, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the interim, </span>between the time the land was unjustly repossessed from the purchaser and the time when the injustice is reversed, the one who repossessed the land <span class="gemarra-regular">seizes </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">and consumes </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he enjoys the profits produced by the land, and it will be difficult to receive full reimbursement for this stolen produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the reason the option of writing a receipt for the seller of the land is not pursued here is that there is a concern <span class="gemarra-regular">about one who purchases </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee. </span>As such a purchaser knows that he has no recourse to be reimbursed from the seller if the land he bought is repossessed, he will never contact the seller and discover that the seller has a receipt and that he has been the victim of an unjust double collection.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the same concern should be taken into consideration in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">promissory notes as well. </span>And yet Rav Pappa, or Rav Ashi, said that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concedes that a receipt may be written for the debtor to enable the collection of a debt in the event of the loss of the promissory note. Why are the aforementioned concerns not applicable to the case of debt collection?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, where </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">owes money, </span>when the creditor seeks to repossess sold land, the purchaser of that land <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>to himself: There is a possibility that the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased the creditor by </span>paying him <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>since debts are usually settled with money. I will therefore investigate the matter with the debtor before allowing the creditor to repossess my land. At that point the receipt, held by the debtor, will be discovered, and double collection will be prevented. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, where he owes land, </span>as the issue is that the claim is based on reimbursement for having bought stolen land, the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">knows that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>common for one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">owed land </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased with money </span>in such cases. The purchaser will therefore allow his land to be repossessed and will seek reimbursement at a later time.
§ The Gemara returns to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and analyzes one of its statements. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to deeds of buying and selling land, the court may write a replacement document, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding the guarante</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the first document that if the field is repossessed the seller will compensate the purchaser for his loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">How do we write </span>a bill of sale in such a way that it does not include this guarantee? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that the case is one in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">writes as follows: Our deed is not </span>intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to enable </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">collection </span>of reimbursement in event of repossession, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>collection <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened </span>property that has been sold <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>collection <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unsold </span>property; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it is intended merely to ensure <span class="gemarra-regular">that the land is established in the possession of the purchaser.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>statement of Rav Naḥman serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that the omission of the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee </span>of the sale from a document <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scribal error</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is, it is assumed that when one purchases land he expects to have his purchase guaranteed, and that if such a clause is not stated in the document it is presumed to be a mere scribal oversight, and a guarantee is in effect. Rav Naḥman said, in explaining the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>a land purchase would not have a guarantee <span class="gemarra-regular">is that </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote this for him, </span>i.e., he wrote that there is no guarantee, explicitly in the deed; <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>indicates that if the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">did not write this </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purchaser, but left out the subject of the guarantee altogether, the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>nevertheless have the guarantee and would be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>reimbursement from the seller in the event of repossession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The omission of the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee </span>of the sale from a document <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a scribal error. </span>Accordingly, if mention of a guarantee is omitted from a bill of sale, there is in fact no guarantee. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Excluding the guarantee that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the first document? It means simply <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in this case there was <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>clause about a <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee written in it </span>at all.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who gave money to a certain man to </span>act as her agent and <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase land for her. </span>The agent <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, </span>but he conducted the purchase in such a way that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The woman wanted to take action against the agent and <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>to ask what recourse she had.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the agent: The principle with regard to an agent is that if he acts to the detriment of the one who appointed him, the one who appointed him can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">I sent you</span> to act <span class="gemarra-regular">for my benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and not to my detriment. </span>Therefore, the entire agency is null and void, thereby negating the purchase. Nevertheless, you agreed to purchase the land without a guarantee. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>yourself and <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">from him without a guarantee, and then sell it to </span>this woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a guarantee </span>that you will reimburse her in the event the land is repossessed.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives a gift</span> of land <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, and </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">returned the deed to him, his gift</span> of land <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>to him as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: His gift </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>in the possession of the recipient. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? Rav Asi says: It becomes as </span>if the giver <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> the recipient: <span class="gemarra-regular">This field is given to you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as the deed </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">in your possession. </span>Therefore, by returning the deed to the giver, the recipient is canceling the gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba objects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to this: If that is so </span>that these are the conditions of the gift, then when the deed is <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">or lost </span>by the recipient, the gift should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be canceled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba said </span>a different explanation: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about </span>whether or not the <span class="gemarra-regular">letters, </span>i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are acquired by </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">transferring </span>the document from one holder of the document to another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquired by transferrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the document. Therefore, if the recipient returns the bill of sale to the giver, the land returns to the giver as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are not acquired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by transferrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the document.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who comes </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">to be judged </span>over a claim that land that is in his possession belongs to another, if he claims ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">based on a deed, </span>i.e., a bill of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>claims further that he is the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">based on presumptive ownership </span>of the land, as it was in his uncontested possession for three years, and he therefore does not need the deed as proof, his claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">judged based on</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">deed. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>His claim is judged <span class="gemarra-regular">based </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: They disagree </span>about whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are acquired by transferring </span>the document from one holder of the document to another. 

Daf 170a

The Gemara explains: This is a case where one party sold land to another, who then sold it to a third party by transferring the bill of sale to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">letters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not acquired by transferring </span>possession of the document. Handing the bill to the third party is therefore not a valid act of acquisition. In in order to establish that the land is his, one must prove presumptive ownership by demonstrating that he has lived in the land uncontested for three years. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are acquired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by transferring </span>possession of the document. Therefore, if the third party produces the bill of sale that had been transferred to him, this is sufficient proof that the land is his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>objected and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that letters are not acquired by transferring possession of the bill of sale, this would be in <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreement with </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>Rabba, said earlier, that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that letters are acquired by transferring possession of the bill of sale. Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> back <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: And let it be in disagreement. </span>I am not obligated to be in agreement with Rabba.
Abaye clarified his objection and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This is what I </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you. The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> (168b), which Rabba was explaining, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be explained only </span>the way the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">explained </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if so, </span>i.e., if you do not agree with Rabba’s understanding of the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty, </span>as there is a contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said </span>that the explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning one who appears before a court to be judged is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of </span>the witnesses signed on the bill <span class="gemarra-regular">was found to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be a relative </span>to one of the parties, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>he was found to be <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>from bearing witness for another reason, and therefore the document is rendered invalid.
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the two opinions in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, who says: The witnesses of the transmission </span>of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">effect </span>the transaction, meaning that witnesses are not required to be signed on a document at all, provided that there are witnesses who saw the transfer of the document to the relevant party. It is therefore inconsequential that one of the witnesses that signed the document is disqualified. This is why Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that the claim is judged based on the deed, i.e., the deed is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: The signatory witnesses</span> on the document <span class="gemarra-regular">effect </span>the transaction, meaning that it is necessary for a document to have witnesses sign it. If there are no witnesses or if one or both of them are disqualified, the document is not valid even if its transmission is witnessed by qualified witnesses. This is why Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the claim is judged based on the claimant’s presumptive ownership; this is his only valid proof since the deed he possesses is not valid.
The Gemara objects to Abaye’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Abba say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a document whose <span class="gemarra-regular">falsification is inherent in i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it is not valid? </span>Rabbi Elazar said only that a document that has no witnesses signed on it at all is valid if its transmission was witnessed. If the document has disqualified witnesses, he agrees it is not valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Avina said</span> a modification of Abaye’s explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">All concede that if it is written in </span>the document: <span class="gemarra-regular">We, </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in </span>an investigation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the testimony of the witnesses </span>and have determined that they signed the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their testimony was found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">false, </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">is not valid, in accordance with</span> the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abba. They disagree only with regard to a document upon which there are no witnesses </span>signed <span class="gemarra-regular">at all. As Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, who says: The witnesses of the transmission </span>of the document <span class="gemarra-regular">effect </span>the transaction. Signatory witnesses are not necessary, and the deed can therefore be used as proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: The signatory witnesses </span>on the document <span class="gemarra-regular">effect </span>the transaction, so the deed cannot be used. Therefore, the only valid proof would be based on his presumptive ownership.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: The case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is one where the alleged purchaser has a bill of sale for the land, but the alleged seller, although he admits that the document was written with his consent, claims that the sale did not ultimately occur, and that the alleged purchaser took the document from him. And the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree, with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whether the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect, and, by extension, in a case where a seller admits that he wrote a bill of sale, whether the purchaser must ratify it in court in order to establish its validity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that in the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not required to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect what is owed to him. In this case as well, the purchaser can use the bill of sale as proof that he is the rightful owner of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that in the case of a debtor who admits that he wrote a promissory note, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to ratify it </span>in court in order to use it to collect the debt. In this case as well, since the purchaser is unable to ratify it, his only recourse to prove his ownership is showing that he lived in the land uncontested for three years.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we hear the opposite concerning </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 1:8) that if <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people, the debtor and the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">are grasping </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor says: It is mine,</span> i.e., the debt has not yet been paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it fell from me, and you, </span>the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">found it, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">debtor says: It is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>i.e., I did borrow the money from you, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I paid you </span>and was given the promissory note, and it fell from me, and you found it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note must be ratified through its signatories, </span>even though the debtor admits it is a valid document. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the statement of Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: They should divide </span>the amount written in the promissory note, i.e., the debtor must pay half of the recorded sum to the creditor.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>once before and asked the following question about it: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi agree to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 2a), with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people who came to court <span class="gemarra-regular">holding a garment, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: I found it, and that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: I found it; </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath that he does not have </span>claim to <span class="gemarra-regular">less than half of it, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath that he does not have </span>claim to <span class="gemarra-regular">less than half of it, and they divide </span>it? Why does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi not maintain that in a case where the debtor and creditor are grasping a promissory note, there too they should divide the money?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in response to this question <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ratified </span>promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that they should divide </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a note <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not ratified. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that in the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect the debt from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he </span>successfully <span class="gemarra-regular">ratifies it, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">collects half </span>of the recorded sum, since the two parties are contesting ownership of the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>successful in ratifying the note, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is merely a shard, </span>i.e., a worthless piece of paper.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that in the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who admits that he wrote </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not required to ratify it </span>in court in order to collect payment. Since the note is valid and fit for collection, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should divide </span>it, i.e., the creditor collects half the sum, as the ownership of the document is contested. The positions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel are therefore the reverse of what the Gemara proposed in its explanation of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the way the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel are recorded in one of the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> so that they are consistent in both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, do not reverse </span>their opinions. There is no contradiction between them, because the issue in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not whether or not a bill of sale must be ratified when the seller admits that he wrote it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to verifying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they disagree about whether a litigant is required to verify all his claims in circumstances where his case is strong enough to have the court rule in his favor even if they were to disregard some of his claims. Generally, if one has evidence of presumptive ownership of a field he does not have to produce a bill of sale for it. Here, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that since the one occupying the land claims that he has a bill of sale, he must verify this claim by producing it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that he is not required to produce it, as the claim of presumptive ownership suffices.
The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef was owed money by Rabbi Abba. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa. </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid you </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so. Rabbi Yitzḥak</span> Nappaḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abba: The witnesses you have named, <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so and so-and-so, must come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and testify </span>that they saw you repay the loan. Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they do not come, am I not deemed credible </span>to say that I repaid the loan? <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t we maintain </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">need not repay him in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>as he is deemed credible to say he repaid the debt even with no supporting testimony?
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to this </span>issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">I hold like the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> said <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>i.e., you yourself. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one says to another, </span>i.e., if a debtor says to his creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">required that so-and-so and so-and-so come </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">and testify </span>that they witnessed the repayment. Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Giddel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>that it is not required that a litigant verify all his stated claims if his case is sufficiently strong without those claims? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span>

Daf 170b

<span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the litigant loses the case if he cannot produce verification of his extraneous claims, but <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that he is told <span class="gemarra-regular">to verify </span>those claims if he can. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">I, too, am saying </span>only that you are required <span class="gemarra-regular">to verify </span>your claim if you can; if you cannot, you will not be required to pay.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">who repaid part of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">debt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">should exchange </span>the promissory note for a new one stating the current balance and tear up the first promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>The creditor may keep the original promissory note, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">should write a receipt </span>for the payment he has received and give it to the debtor as proof of his partial payment of the sum recorded in the old note. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>with regard to this arrangement: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">must </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">guard his receipt against </span>being destroyed by <span class="gemarra-regular">mice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as if he no longer has the receipt, he will have to pay the entire sum recorded in the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said to him: This </span>situation is <span class="gemarra-regular">fitting for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> it is better that this procedure be followed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the strength of </span>the claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">not be weakened.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, nor </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the court tears up the </span>original promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note and writes a different </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for </span>the creditor, listing the new sum owed, dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from the time </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>document.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba </span>who said this <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Huna: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If Rav would have heard this </span>following <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the proper procedure is that the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses tear the </span>original promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note and write another </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for </span>the creditor listing the new sum owed, dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from the time </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>document, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have retracte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> his statement that the court tears the promissory note and writes a new one.
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not retract </span>his statement. While Rabbi Yehuda says in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the witnesses write a new promissory note, Rav maintains that this must be done specifically by a court. Why is this? 

Daf 171a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a court </span>can write a new document, because the court <span class="gemarra-regular">has the power to confiscate money. </span>A creditor has the right to seize any property that the debtor had owned on the day the promissory note was written, even if that property was subsequently sold to others; the earlier the date on the note, the more properties it applies to. By dating the new document on the date of the original document the creditor is once again given the right to seize properties from those who had purchased land from the debtor in between the date of the original loan and the date the new promissory note is actually written. The court has such confiscatory power. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">performed their agency, </span>i.e., fulfilled their assigned role, the first time they wrote the promissory note, can <span class="gemarra-regular">they return and perform their agency </span>again by writing a second promissory note?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that witnesses are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>empowered to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: Witnesses </span>who were commissioned to write a deed for the transfer of property <span class="gemarra-regular">may write even te</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deeds for one field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If the original deed is lost or destroyed, the witnesses may write a replacement deed for the purchaser, even if the deed is lost many times.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says </span>an answer to this question: Rav Yehuda’s statement was concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed of gift, </span>not a bill of sale. A gift of land has no guarantee; if it is repossessed from the recipient by the giver’s creditor to repay the giver’s debt, the recipient has no recourse and cannot collect any money from anyone. Therefore, in this case no one is jeopardized by the writing of many replacement deeds, which are intended only to serve as a proof that the recipient is actually entitled to the land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says: </span>It is possible to say that Rav Yehuda’s statement applied even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a bill </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not have a guarantee in it. </span>In that case as well, there is no potential loss to any purchasers of land. By contrast, in the case of a promissory note, which can be used to repossess property from those who have purchased land from the debtor, witnesses do not have the authority to predate a document and thereby subject more purchasers to possible land seizures due to the predating of the document.
The Gemara cited an excerpt from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> earlier. It now cites it in full: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the full text of the <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is taught: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand dinars are owed by </span>a debtor, and the debt is recorded in a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid five hundred dinars out of </span>the total, the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses tear the </span>original promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note and write another </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for him, </span>dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>note. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: This </span>original promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note shall remain in its place, </span>in the custody of the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a receipt </span>for the five hundred dinars that were repaid. This receipt is given to the debtor to protect himself against a possible attempt by the creditor to use the promissory note to collect the entire one thousand dinars.
Rabbi Yosei continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two reasons why </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they write a receipt, </span>as opposed to writing a new promissory note: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can coerce </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">to repay him, </span>i.e., the psychological pressure for the debtor of knowing that the creditor has a promissory note with a larger amount listed than what he owes him will induce the debtor to repay the remainder promptly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he, </span>the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>liened property <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first date, </span>that of the original document.
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s second reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda also say </span>that the new document must be dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>document? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yosei did not hear a full explanation of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion; he heard only that Rabbi Yehuda prescribed writing a new promissory note recording the new balance. And <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei is saying to Rabbi Yehuda: If you </span>mean to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the new promissory note is dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>document, <span class="gemarra-regular">I disagree with you on one </span>count, as I hold a receipt should be written to pressure the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you mean to say that the second promissory note is dated <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second date, </span>i.e., from when the second promissory note was written, <span class="gemarra-regular">I disagree with you on two </span>counts.
§ The Gemara discusses a related <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 1:3): If there is a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note whose date is written as a Shabbat or as the tenth of Tishrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Yom Kippur, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>assumed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a postdated </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as writing is forbidden on Shabbat and Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei deems </span>the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid. Rabbi Yehuda said to </span>Rabbi Yosei: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident come before you in Tzippori, and you </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed </span>the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: When I deemed </span>the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">valid, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case like <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>where the date was a Shabbat or Yom Kippur, that <span class="gemarra-regular">I deemed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
The Gemara is puzzled by Rabbi Yosei’s response at the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yehuda was also speaking in </span>a case like <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>where the date was a Shabbat or Yom Kippur, and yet Rabbi Yosei’s opinion was that the promissory note is invalid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pedat says: All </span>parties to this dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if we engaged in </span>an investigation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the date of the document, and its date was found to be exactly on Shabbat or on the tenth of Tishrei, </span>that it is self-evident <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is a postdated </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and is valid. </span>

Daf 171b

The two Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only with regard to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a postdated </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note in general, </span>i.e., one in which the fact that it is postdated is not readily discernible from the dating of the document, as opposed to one dated on Shabbat or Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yehuda </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he says: </span>One does <span class="gemarra-regular">not write a receipt </span>for a debtor when he pays his debt; rather, the original document is torn, and in the case of partial repayment a new document is written, attesting to the balance due. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">no harm can emerge from </span>a postdated document. There is no concern that the date on the postdated document may have been recorded after the writing of a receipt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt </span>for a debtor when he pays his debt, in lieu of tearing the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">harm can emerge from </span>a postdated promissory note. Harm can occur in a case such as the following: The loan was given on the first of Nisan. The debt was paid on the following day and, rather than tearing the promissory note, a receipt was written and dated on the second of Nisan. If the original note had been postdated to the third of Nisan or thereafter, the creditor could use it to collect his debt a second time, arguing that the debtor’s receipt is irrelevant, as its date is prior to the date in the promissory note.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: Even according to the one who says </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt </span>for the debtor when he pays, in lieu of tearing the promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> a case where the debtor pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half, </span>i.e., a portion, of the debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>a case where the debtor comes to repay <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the debt and the creditor has lost the promissory note and cannot tear it, all agree that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>write a receipt. Rather, the debtor will not be required to repay the loan unless the creditor can produce the promissory note.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is not so; we write </span>a receipt <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>a case where the debtor pays <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the debt.
The Gemara proves its assertion: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef was owed money by Rabbi Abba. </span>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my money. </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">give me my </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">take your money. </span>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I lost your </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note; </span>instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will write a receipt for you. </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Isn’t </span>there the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel, who both say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not write a receipt?</span>
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, the judge, thereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Who will give us </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of the dust of Rav and Shmuel, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">I will place it on my eyes, </span>so highly do I regard them. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t </span>there the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, who both say </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ilai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it stands to reason that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt. As, if </span>it would <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind that </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not write a receipt, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">if the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of this </span>creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is lost, should this </span>debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">eat and rejoice? </span>Is it fair that he should keep money that he knows he owes the creditor?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye objects to this </span>line of reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>should the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> be, that one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes a receipt </span>when the creditor cannot find the promissory note? If <span class="gemarra-regular">the receipt of </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">is lost, should this </span>creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">eat and rejoice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Once the debtor has lost his receipt, there is nothing to prevent the creditor from collecting the debt a second time. This, too, is unfair. In either case, whether a receipt is written or not, an injustice could result. Why should it be preferred that the potential of suffering an injustice should be borne by the debtor rather than the creditor? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it is preferable, because, as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The borrower is a servant to the lender” </span>(Proverbs 22:7). The debtor’s interests are subordinated to those of the creditor.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 10:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">Promissory notes that are antedate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not valid, but </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">that are postdate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are valid.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">promissory notes, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds of buying and selling </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">even postdate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> documents <span class="gemarra-regular">are not valid. What is the reason </span>for this stringency in the case of bills of sale? If postdated documents were allowed, there could be <span class="gemarra-regular">times that </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">sells land to </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Nisan </span>of a particular year <span class="gemarra-regular">and writes </span>a postdated deed <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>stating that the sale took place <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">Tishrei, and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">money happens to </span>reach the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>Nisan and Tishrei <span class="gemarra-regular">and he purchases </span>the land back <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the purchaser. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Tishrei arrives,</span> the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>the original bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">and says to </span>the seller: It is true that you purchased the field from me, but <span class="gemarra-regular">I then purchased it from you </span>again now, in Tishrei, as stated in this document.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>a similar scenario could occur with <span class="gemarra-regular">promissory notes as well: </span>There could be <span class="gemarra-regular">times that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> borrows </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">in Nisan and writes </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for </span>the creditor stating that the loan took place <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">Tishrei, and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">money happens to </span>reach the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>Nisan and Tishrei <span class="gemarra-regular">and he repays </span>his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the creditor early <span class="gemarra-regular">and says to him: Give me my </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note. And </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: I lost </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he writes him a receipt </span>instead. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> then, <span class="gemarra-regular">when the time </span>written in the note <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>the supposedly lost promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">and says to </span>the debtor: It is true that you repaid me previously, but <span class="gemarra-regular">it is now, </span>after you repaid that loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you borrowed from me these </span>dinars recorded in this document, which is dated in Tishrei.
The Gemara answers: Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not write a receipt, </span>so that scenario cannot occur. Like Rabbi Yehuda, Rav Hamnuna maintains that if a creditor loses his promissory note the debtor does not have to repay the loan. Rabbi Yosei, who does allow the creditor to collect his debt in such a case and write a receipt for the debtor, is concerned about that scenario, and consequently he holds that postdated promissory notes are not valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said to Rav Kahana, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya of Difti </span>who said this <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Kahana: And today, when we write postdated </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">write a receipt </span>in cases where the creditor loses his promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do we do this? </span>The combination of allowing postdated promissory notes and allowing the writing of a receipt instead of producing the promissory note would enable double collection of the loan to take place. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The problem was rectified <span class="gemarra-regular">after Rabbi Abba told his </span>court <span class="gemarra-regular">scribe: When you write postdated </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes, write as follows: We did not write this document on its date, </span>i.e., on the date written within the document; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, we postdated it and wrote it. </span>Since it is clear from the text of the document that it was postdated, double collection of the loan is avoided.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: But</span> what about <span class="gemarra-regular">today, when we do not do this, </span>i.e., we do not follow Rabbi Abba’s instructions? How do we avoid double collection of the loan? Rav Kahana replied: The problem was rectified <span class="gemarra-regular">after Rav Safra said to his </span>court <span class="gemarra-regular">scribe: When you write these receipts </span>for debtors who pay debts without the original promissory note being torn, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you know the date </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>missing promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, write </span>it into the receipt. But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>you do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>know the date written in the promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>the receipt <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., do not write any date at all in the receipt, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whenever </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the promissory note, the undated receipt <span class="gemarra-regular">can weaken it, </span>i.e., exempt the debtor from payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Kahana: </span>

Daf 172a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But today, when we do not do this </span>either when writing receipts, how can we avoid double collection of a loan? Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Sages instituted </span>taking this precaution. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who does </span>what the Sages instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>it and protects himself from loss; and as for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who does not do </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has brought the loss upon himself, </span>and will suffer the consequences if the promissory note is found and presented in the future.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Sheila said to those who wrote deeds of acquisition, </span>i.e., deeds of sale or deeds of gifts for property they acquired: <span class="gemarra-regular">When you write deeds of acquisition </span>after the acquisition was performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you know the day on which you effected the acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write </span>that date on the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>you do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>know the day on which you effected the acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">write the date on which you are currently </span>writing the document. You should follow this procedure, and not write an approximate or estimated date, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the document shall <span class="gemarra-regular">not appear as a falsehood.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to his scribe, and Rav Huna said similarly to his scribe: When you</span> are writing a document and you <span class="gemarra-regular">are situated in Shili, write </span>that the document was written <span class="gemarra-regular">in Shili, and </span>you should do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the matters were given over to you, </span>i.e., the transaction attested to in the document took place, <span class="gemarra-regular">in Hini</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When you are situated in Hini, write </span>that the document was written <span class="gemarra-regular">in Hini, even if the matters were given over to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Shili.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who is holding </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note of one hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he says </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Prepare </span>this note <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>i.e., exchange it, for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>notes <span class="gemarra-regular">of fifty </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">each, </span>so that if the debtor pays half the debt I will be able to give him one document and keep the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not prepare </span>the new notes for him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? The Sages have performed a matter </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the creditor and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the debtor </span>as well. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the creditor </span>to keep the promissory note with the larger sum <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">coerce </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">to repay him, </span>as there is a greater incentive to pay off a larger promissory note than a smaller one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the debtor, so that </span>when he pays half the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note becomes vitiated, </span>and the remainder of the sum written in the vitiated promissory note can be collected only if the creditor takes an oath that he has not received the entire sum.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said</span> further: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who is holding two </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes, each of fifty dinars, </span>owed by the same person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he says </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Prepare </span>this note <span class="gemarra-regular">for me </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>note <span class="gemarra-regular">of one hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not prepare</span> the new note for him.
What is the reason? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages have performed a matter </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the creditor and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the debtor </span>as well. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the creditor </span>to keep the smaller notes, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>if the debtor pays fifty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note will not become vitiated, </span>which would require the creditor to take an oath before collecting the remainder. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial to the debtor, so that </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">coerce him to repay </span>the debt quickly, as there is a greater incentive to repay a larger sum than a smaller one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who is holding </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note of one hundred dinars, and he said </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Prepare </span>this note <span class="gemarra-regular">for me </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>note <span class="gemarra-regular">of fifty </span>dinars, as the debtor has paid me half, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not prepare </span>the new note for him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? We say, </span>i.e., we are concerned, that the following may have happened: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>debtor actually <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>all one hundred dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when he did so he <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me</span> back <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note. And </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I lost it. And </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote a receipt for him </span>in lieu of handing over the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>now, if we write a new promissory note of fifty dinars for the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will present this </span>note <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to </span>the debtor, who presents his receipt for a hundred dinars: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>receipt <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a different </span>loan that you repaid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bathhous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or an olive press </span>as an inheritance, if the father had <span class="gemarra-regular">built </span>these facilities <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">profit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to charge others for using them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the profit </span>that accrues after the father’s death is <span class="gemarra-regular">shared </span><span class="gemarra-regular">equall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> by the two brothers. If the father had <span class="gemarra-regular">built them for himself </span>and for the members of his household to use, the poor brother, who has little use for these amenities, cannot force the rich brother to convert the facilities to commercial use; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the rich </span>brother can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the poor </span>brother: Go <span class="gemarra-regular">take servants for yourself, and they will bathe in the bathhouse. </span>Or he can say: Go <span class="gemarra-regular">take olives for yourself, and come and make </span>them into oil <span class="gemarra-regular">in the olive press.</span>
If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who were</span> living <span class="gemarra-regular">in one city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other, </span>as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor can another, </span>third person, <span class="gemarra-regular">present a promissory note against </span>either of <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>as each one can claim: It is not I but the other Yosef ben Shimon who owes you money.
If a document <span class="gemarra-regular">is found among one’s documents </span>stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">The promissory note against Yosef ben Shimon is repaid, </span>and both men named Yosef ben Shimon owed this man money, <span class="gemarra-regular">the promissory notes of both of them </span>are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which is outstanding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What should </span>two people with the same name in a single city <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>in order to conduct their business? <span class="gemarra-regular">They should triple </span>their names by writing three generations: Yosef ben Shimon ben so-and-so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they have </span>identical <span class="gemarra-regular">triple </span>names, i.e., not only their fathers but their grandfathers had identical names, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should write an indication </span>as to which one is referred to, such as: The short Yosef ben Shimon or the dark Yosef ben Shimon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they have </span>identical <span class="gemarra-regular">indications, they should write: </span>Yosef ben Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">the priest, </span>if one of them is a priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note that was presented at the court of Rav Huna, in which it was written: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, borrowed one hundred dinars from you. </span>No name was given as the creditor, but the one presenting the document claimed that the money was owed to him. 

Daf 172b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>The term: <span class="gemarra-regular">From you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the document do not identify anyone in particular, and can mean <span class="gemarra-regular">even: From the Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or even: From King Shapur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to Rabba: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">investigate </span>this matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as tonight Rav Huna will ask this </span>question <span class="gemarra-regular">of you.</span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">went out, examined </span>the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">and discovered </span>a relevant source. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce in which there are </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses on </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">but there is no date </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, Abba Shaul says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written in it: I divorced her today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid.</span>
Rabba concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Today, indicates that day on which </span>the bill of divorce <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges </span>in the presence of the court. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">From you, </span>in a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates that man from whose possession it emerges.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But </span>this is not a valid proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps Abba Shaul holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses of the transmission </span>of the bill of divorce <span class="gemarra-regular">effect </span>the divorce. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern for </span>the possibility of the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling</span> from its rightful owner and being found by the present holder of the document.
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are not concerned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the possibility of a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span>from its rightful owner and being found by another. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say, </span>i.e., from where can it be proven, <span class="gemarra-regular">that we are not concerned for </span>the possibility of a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span>and being found by another?
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the mishna: If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who were </span>living <span class="gemarra-regular">in one city,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other, </span>as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor can another, </span>third person, <span class="gemarra-regular">present a promissory note against </span>either of <span class="gemarra-regular">them. This </span>indicates that one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them can </span>present a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">against others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But why </span>can they do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>there be <span class="gemarra-regular">a concern for </span>the possibility of the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span>from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from this </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned for </span>the possibility of the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span>from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why did <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>who is concerned for this possibility, not see a proof to the contrary from the mishna? He would counter: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are not concerned for </span>the possibility of a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling from one </span>particular person and being found by the other person with the same name, which is the case in the mishna, as that is extremely unlikely. <span class="gemarra-regular">We are concerned for </span>the possibility of a promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one of the general <span class="gemarra-regular">public </span>and being found by someone else. 

Daf 173a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the two men named Yosef ben Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot produce a promissory note, this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">against that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">so they cannot produce </span>promissory notes <span class="gemarra-regular">against others, </span>as those others can claim: I did not borrow from you but from the other Yosef ben Shimon, and somehow the note he was holding is in your possession? This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradicts the mishna, from which it was inferred that one of the two men named Yosef ben Shimon can produce promissory notes to collect the debt from others. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>the mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree with regard to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">letters, </span>i.e., the content of a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">are acquired by </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">transferrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the document to a new owner. In other words, they disagree about whether or not a creditor can transfer his right to collect a debt to another by merely transferring the document to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are acquired by transferring</span> the document. There is no concern that the promissory note was inadvertently transferred from one Yosef ben Shimon to the other by being lost and then found, as explained earlier. Nevertheless, there is still the possibility that one Yosef ben Shimon deliberately transferred the promissory note to the other, transferring the right of collection to him. According to this <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, the second Yosef ben Shimon is fully entitled to collect the debt by producing the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are not acquired by transferrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the document, so that even if one Yosef ben Shimon transferred his promissory note to the other, the new holder of the document is not entitled to collect the debt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say that everyone, </span>i.e., both the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna and the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">letters are acquired by transferring </span>the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here they disagree with regard to </span>whether or not the new holder of the promissory note is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to bring proof </span>that the original creditor transferred it to him for collection, as opposed to his having received it for safekeeping or having found it by chance. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the present holder of the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">not required to bring proof </span>that the debt was transferred to him and therefore he can collect the debt through the promissory note in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to bring </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">proof, </span>and in its absence he cannot collect the debt with the document he holds.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated: Letters are acquired by transferring </span>the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>The new holder of the document is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to bring proof </span>that he has in fact acquired the right to collect the debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: He is not required to bring</span> such <span class="gemarra-regular">proof; </span>it is assumed that if he is holding the document it was transferred to him knowingly by the original creditor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: From where do I say </span>that he is required to bring proof? This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, </span>heirs of an estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">who has a promissory note in his possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> listing a debt owed to the deceased father, and he seeks to collect the debt for himself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him to bring proof </span>that the document was transferred to him legally by his father in his lifetime, or that it was bequeathed to him specifically and he did not appropriate it from the other brothers. Abaye concludes from this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is the same not true for </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">others </span>in a similar situation? In other words, whenever someone holds a promissory note that did not initially belong to him he is required to prove that he acquired it legally.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said </span>in response: Proof is not generally required in such a case. But the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>who are heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as </span>it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <span class="gemarra-regular">seize </span>property belonging to the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">from one another.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>there is a different version of this exchange between Abaye and Rava. According to this version, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From where do I say </span>that no proof is required? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, </span>heirs of an estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">who has a promissory note in his possession </span>listing a debt owed to the deceased father, and he seeks to collect the debt for himself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him to bring proof </span>that the document was transferred to him legally by his father in his lifetime, or that it was bequeathed to him specifically and that he did not appropriate it from the other brothers. The implication is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>who must bring such proof, as it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <span class="gemarra-regular">seize </span>property belonging to the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">from one another. But others </span>in a similar situation do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to bring proof that they acquired the promissory note legally.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how would <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>counter this proof? He would say: There is no difference between <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>and anyone else; they all have to bring proof. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> specifies brothers because it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for it </span>to mention that case, as it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <span class="gemarra-regular">seize </span>property belonging to the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">from one another, </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are careful </span>to prevent such attempts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, when brothers produce a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not required to bring proof </span>that they obtained it legally, as it is assumed that the other brothers would not have allowed the note to escape their possession otherwise. To counter this, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that brothers, too, must bring proof when they produce promissory notes.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the case of two men with the same name. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what about <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the two men named Yosef ben Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">can produce a promissory note against others, so can they produce </span>promissory notes <span class="gemarra-regular">against one another. </span>This represents a third opinion, standing in opposition to both the mishna and the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do </span>the mishna and first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> on the one hand, and this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> on the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree about </span>whether or not a scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">may write </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for a debtor even if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor is not with him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">may write</span> a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for a debtor even if the creditor is not with him. </span>The Gemara explains: At <span class="gemarra-regular">times, </span>it could happen <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one of the men named Yosef ben Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to a scribe and </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses and says to them: Write </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for me, as I wish to borrow </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from another Yosef ben Shimon. And </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">after they write </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">and sign </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">take it and say to </span>the other Yosef ben Shimon: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me the hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that you borrowed from me, </span>as attested to in this document. That is the reason why the mishna rules that two people of the same name cannot collect a debt through a promissory note from one another, thereby preventing this occurrence.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that a scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for a debtor unless </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor is with him </span>and consents to the writing of the document. If one Yosef ben Shimon consents to the writing of the document before the other, they apparently trust one another, and there is no concern that the one holding the promissory note will defraud the other.
§ The mishna teaches: If a document is <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span><span class="gemarra-regular">among one’s documents </span>stating: The promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note against Yosef ben Shimon is repaid, </span>and both men named Yosef ben Shimon owed this man money, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes of both of them are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which is outstanding. The Gemara comments: The implication of the mishna is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>this man cannot collect his debt is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this note <span class="gemarra-regular">was found </span>among his papers; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>suddenly found, rather he was always aware of its existence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he could present </span>a promissory note against one of the men named Yosef ben Shimon and collect the debt from him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>earlier in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor can another present a promissory note against </span>either of <span class="gemarra-regular">them?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>This later line in the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a promissory note in which the debtors Yosef ben Shimon are identified by having their names <span class="gemarra-regular">tripled, </span>i.e., through mentioning the name of their respective grandfathers, as is explained at the end of the mishna.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us see in whose name </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">receipt, </span>i.e., the note stating that Yosef ben Shimon’s debt has been repaid, <span class="gemarra-regular">is written. </span>Why is there uncertainty as to which Yosef ben Shimon is referred to in the document? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya said: </span>The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the debtors are identified by having their names <span class="gemarra-regular">tripled in the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, but </span>the names are <span class="gemarra-regular">not tripled in the receipt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye stated </span>a different answer to this question, that the mishna is speaking about the debtor, not the creditor, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is saying: </span>If a receipt is <span class="gemarra-regular">found among the debtor’s document</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f  Y</span><span class="gemarra-regular">osef ben Shimon </span>against me has been <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>and this debtor had borrowed money from both men named Yosef ben Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes of both of them are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they are not valid for collection, as it cannot be determined which debt was paid and which one is outstanding.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">What should </span>two people with the same name in a single city <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>in order to conduct their business? <span class="gemarra-regular">They should triple </span>their names by writing three generations: Yosef ben Shimon ben so-and-so. If their grandfather’s names are identical and they have no prominent physical difference to indicate who is the one listed in the document, they write that the one referred to in the document is a priest, if that is the case. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the following continuation of the mishna in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: And <span class="gemarra-regular">if both of them were priests, they should write </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>of ancestors, until a divergence in names is found that can serve as a means of identification.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his son </span>before dying: One promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note among </span>the promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">is repaid, but I do not know which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes of all of </span>those who owe him money <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>i.e., they are not valid for collection, as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which are outstanding. If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>among his papers <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>promissory notes owed <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>person, the one for <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, and </span>the one for <span class="gemarra-regular">the smaller </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid</span> and can be collected; the debtor is favored in the case of an uncertainty.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that if a creditor says to a debtor who borrowed money twice from him: One promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>of the two that I have <span class="gemarra-regular">of yours in my possession is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repaid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without specifying which one, the one for <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, and </span>the one for <span class="gemarra-regular">the smaller </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>and can be collected. If the creditor said instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">The debt of yours </span>that I have <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession is repaid, all </span>the promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">notes </span>this creditor has from this debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid, </span>as the term debt covers all the loans at once.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rava: If that is so </span>that when one makes an ambiguous statement it is interpreted to his detriment, does the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apply to sales? If a seller of land writes a document for a purchaser stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">My field is </span>hereby <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without specifying which of his two fields he is referring to, is it the <span class="gemarra-regular">larger field </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to him? </span>And if he writes a document for the purchaser stating: The <span class="gemarra-regular">field that I have is sold to you, </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his fields are sold to him, </span>as the Hebrew word for field can refer to several fields as well as a single field?
Rava explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, the holder of the document </span>of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">is at a disadvantage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is he who seeks to take more property from the seller, and must accept the minimal meaning. Here too, in the case of the promissory notes, it is the holder of the document, the creditor, who seeks to collect more money from the debtor. Therefore, the creditor is at a disadvantage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another with </span>the assurance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor. </span>

Daf 173b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the debtor: I am lending the money <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that I will collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from whomever I wish, </span>i.e., either the debtor or the guarantor, he <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property </span>of his own, then <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, <span class="gemarra-regular">or that </span>case, where he did not, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And so Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from whom the woman can collect payment of her marriage contract instead of collecting it from the husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and her husband was divorcing her, </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">must take a vow </span>prohibiting himself from deriving any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from her, </span>so that he can never remarry her. This precaution is taken <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the couple <span class="gemarra-regular">collude [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kenunya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to divorce in order to collect payment of the marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>guarantor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property, and </span>then the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">will remarry</span> his wife.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: One who lends money to another with a guarantor cannot collect the debt from the guarantor. The Gemara at first understands that the mishna is ruling that a guarantor’s commitment is limited to when the debtor dies or flees. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>the guarantor’s commitment is limited? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef both say </span>that the guarantor can tell the creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">You gave a man over to me, </span>to take responsibility for him if he dies or flees; <span class="gemarra-regular">I have given a man </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to you. </span>The debtor is here before you; take your money from him, and if he has nothing, suffer the loss yourself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman objects to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this: This is Persian law.</span>
The Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>the Persian courts <span class="gemarra-regular">go after the guarantor</span> directly, without even attempting to collect the debt from the debtor himself. Why, then, did Rav Naḥman say that excusing the guarantor from payment is Persian law?
The Gemara clarifies Rav Naḥman’s intent: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Naḥman meant to say that this kind of ruling would be appropriate for the members of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Persian court, who do not give a reason for their statements, </span>but issue rulings by whim. Rav Naḥman was saying that it is not fair or logical to excuse the guarantor and cause a loss to the creditor who was depending on him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said: What </span>does the mishna mean when it says that the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect</span> the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor? </span>It means that he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot claim </span>payment from the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantor at the outset, </span>until after it is established that the debtor has no means to repay the debt. After the borrower defaults, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another with </span>the assurance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor cannot claim </span>payment of the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor at the outset, </span>rather, he must first attempt to collect the debt from the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> the debtor: I am lending the money <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that I will collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from whomever I wish, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">claim payment </span>of the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor at the outset, </span>bypassing the debtor.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a guarantor becomes obligated </span>to repay a loan he has guaranteed? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>that Judah reassured his father concerning the young Benjamin: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I will be his guarantor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of my hand shall you request him” </span>(Genesis 43:9). This teaches that it is possible for one to act as a guarantor that an item will be returned to the giver.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda objects to this:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This </span>incident involving Benjamin is not a case of a standard guarantor, but a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unconditional guarantee, as it is written, </span>also in the context of Benjamin, that Reuben said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you” </span>(Genesis 42:37). One who undertakes unconditional responsibility for a loan has a different status than a standard guarantor, as will soon be elaborated. Therefore, a biblical source has yet to be adduced to teach that one can become a standard guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak said </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman” </span>(Proverbs 20:16). The verse advises a creditor to take the garment of the debtor’s guarantor as payment for the loan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is stated: “My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have shaken your hands for a stranger, you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth, you have been caught by the words of your mouth. Do this now, my son, and save yourself, seeing that you have come into the hand of your neighbor: Go, humble yourself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hitrappes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and assemble your neighbors” </span>(Proverbs 6:1–3). This last part of the passage means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>your neighbor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">money is in your possession, </span>as you owe it as a guarantor, <span class="gemarra-regular">open up [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hatter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the palm [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pissat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of your hand </span>and repay him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>money that you owe him, but rather “you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth” and owe him an apology for a personal slight, <span class="gemarra-regular">gather together many neighbors </span>through which to seek his forgiveness.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: </span>The issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>or not <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to repay the loan he has guaranteed is <span class="gemarra-regular">a disput</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei. According to Rabbi Yosei, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction with inconclusive consent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] effects acquisition, a guarantor becomes obligated </span>to repay the loan, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not effect acquisition, a guarantor </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not become obligated </span>to repay the loan. Any obligation one undertakes that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in this case the debtor’s default on the loan, is considered an <span class="it-text">asmakhta</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Ameimar </span>that he was conflating these two issues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a daily occurrence, </span>i.e., it is taken for granted, <span class="gemarra-regular">that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not effect acquisition, and </span>it is also taken for granted that <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor becomes obligated</span> to repay the loan he has guaranteed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: Through that satisfaction that </span>the guarantor feels when the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">trusts him </span>and loans the money based on his guarantee, the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">resolves </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">obligate himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> to repay the loan. Guaranteeing a loan is unlike a usual case of an obligation undertaken that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in which the commitment is not considered a real one. Here, the one obligating himself experiences a sense of satisfaction when the money is loaned to the debtor, and due to that, fully commits to fulfill his obligation.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the debtor: I am lending the money <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that I will collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from whomever I wish,</span> he can collect the debt from the guarantor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when the debtor has no property </span>of his own from which to repay the loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the debtor has property </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor.</span>
The Gemara questions this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property</span> of his own, then whether in this case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, or that case, where he did not, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor, by inference </span>one can understand <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like this and </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that. </span>Whether or not the debtor has property from which to repay the loan, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.
The Gemara clarifies: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: One who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another with </span>the assurance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guaranto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor </span>before first claiming the debt from the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the debtor: I am lending the money <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that I will collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from whomever I wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? When the debtor has no property </span>of his own from which to repay the debt; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the debtor has property, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor. </span>This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a standard guarantor, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if the debtor has property </span>of his own, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the unconditional guarantor. </span>

Daf 174a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, i.e., whether the guarantor is a standard guarantor or an unconditional guarantor, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>either type of guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Wherever Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the corpus of <span class="gemarra-regular">our Mishna, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the following three cases: The responsibility of the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantor, and </span>the incident that occurred in the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzaidan </span>(see <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 74a), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the dispute with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">evidence </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">final </span>disagreement (see <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 31a).
§ The Gemara discusses which expressions confer upon a person the status of a standard guarantor, and which confer the status of an unconditional guarantor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that if one says to a potential creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">repay </span>the debt, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to repay the debt, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the money back to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">all these are expressions </span>that confer the status of a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee.</span>
If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">repay </span>the debt, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to repay the debt, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give</span> the money back to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">all these are expressions </span>that confer the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantee. </span>The usage of the word give, as opposed to lend, confers the status of an unconditional guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor? </span>On the one hand, the word lend is used, as opposed to give, but on the other hand, he explicitly states that he will be an unconditional guarantor. What is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor? </span>On the one hand, the word give is used, as opposed to lend, but on the other hand, he states that he will be a guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says </span>in resolving this dilemma: When one employs <span class="gemarra-regular">the language of </span>a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>it is a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>even if he also used the word give. And when one employs <span class="gemarra-regular">the language of an unconditional guarantee, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantee, </span>even if he also used the word lend.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: All of </span>the expressions mentioned in this discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">are expressions of an unconditional guarantee, except for: Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him and I </span>am <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: All </span>of the expressions mentioned in this discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">are expressions of </span>a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, except for: Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the money back to you.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Ameimar said to Rav Ashi: My father said the following: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the money back to you, this expression binds the guarantor to such an extent that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lender has no </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">against the debtor at all; </span>his only option is to collect the debt from the guarantor.
The Gemara rejects this last statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the debtor is not exempted from </span>dealing with the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor unless </span>the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the money from the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">and gives </span>it to the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain judge who permitted a creditor to enter the debtor’s property </span>and collect it for his debt <span class="gemarra-regular">before lodging a claim against the debtor </span>himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva, </span>overruled that judge and <span class="gemarra-regular">expelled </span>the creditor from the seized property.
When <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>heard about this he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">wise </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to perfor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such a matter, </span>i.e., to issue this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">if not Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He holds that a person’s property is a guarantee for him, </span>i.e., it acts as a guarantor for the loan if the debtor does not repay it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another with </span>the assurance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor. And we established </span>that the mishna means that he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the guarantor at the outset, </span>before seeking payment from the debtor himself. So too, he cannot collect the debt by taking the debtor’s property without first seeking payment from the debtor himself.
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain guarantor for orphans </span>whose father borrowed money and died, and the orphans were minors, and this guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">to the creditor before informing the orphans </span>that he was repaying the debt for them. The guarantor now sought reimbursement from the orphans.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Repaying a creditor </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and orphans </span>who are minors <span class="gemarra-regular">are not obligated in performing a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They therefore do not have to repay any debts owed by their deceased father until they reach the age of majority.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the orphans do not have to repay the guarantor until reaching majority, but for a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that perhaps the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">gave bundles </span>of money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his creditor before his death, and therefore some or all of the debt has been paid. As long as they are minors, the heirs would not be aware of this payment, but upon reaching majority there is a chance that they may examine their father’s papers and discover that their father had done this. Therefore, payment is deferred until they reach majority. 

Daf 174b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinion of Rav Pappa and that of Rav Huna, son of Yehoshua, as both agree that the orphans are exempt from repaying the debt until they reach majority?
The Gemara answers: The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the one who owed</span> the money, i.e., the deceased, <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>explicitly just before his death that he did not yet repay any of his loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>there is a difference between them in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunicated </span>the deceased for not cooperating with the court in repaying his debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he died </span>while still <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunication, </span>which demonstrates that the debt had not been repaid prior to his death. In both of these cases Rav Pappa would exempt the minor orphans from payment, as minors are not obligated to perform mitzvot, while Rav Huna, son of Yehoshua, would require them to repay the debt immediately, as there is no possibility that their father had repaid the debt.
The Sages of Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from there </span>to Babylonia: In a case where the court had <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunicated </span>a debtor for not cooperating in repaying his debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>while still <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunication, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>and the orphans must repay the debt immediately.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:15): <span class="gemarra-regular">A guarantor </span>for a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">who has the promissory note </span>for that debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> indicating that he has repaid the debt, and now seeks reimbursement from the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>if the debtor has died and the obligation for the debt has fallen to his minor heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if it is written </span>by the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the promissory note: <span class="gemarra-regular">I received </span>repayment <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, </span>the guarantor, then the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt from the minor heirs.
The Gemara explains the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, you find </span>a case where the minor heirs would be required to repay the debt, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">when the one who owed </span>the money, i.e., the deceased, <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>explicitly just before his death that he did not yet repay the loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, </span>who maintains that minor heirs never have to repay their father’s debts, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>What is the case discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>?
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">different there, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for this</span> reason that the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">troubled himself and wrote for </span>the guarantor: <span class="gemarra-regular">I received </span>repayment from you. Once the creditor writes this in the promissory note, it attains the status of a promissory note of the guarantor held directly against the debtor, and even Rav Pappa agrees that a debt that is recorded in a promissory note can be collected from the deceased’s property immediately, even from the minor heirs.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain guarantor </span>who had guaranteed a loan given <span class="gemarra-regular">by a gentile, who repaid the gentile </span>creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the gentile creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">claimed </span>repayment <span class="gemarra-regular">from the orphans </span>who survived the debtor. The guarantor now sought reimbursement from the orphans. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi of Hagronya said in the name of Rava: Even according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned for </span>the possibility that the deceased may have given <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>of money to the creditor before his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish </span>creditor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>according to gentile law he is entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">to a guarantor, we are not concerned for </span>the possibility that the deceased may have given <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>of money. The debtor would not repay the gentile before the loan is due, as the latter has the right to collect directly from the guarantor, and would thereby receive double payment.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Mordekhai: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned for </span>the possibility that the deceased may have given <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>of money, <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish </span>creditor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>according to gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">law they</span> are entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">to a guarantor, no </span>guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">would accept </span>upon himself to guarantee such a loan <span class="gemarra-regular">if the debtor had not given bundles </span>of money as collateral to the gentile creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract, </span>and her husband is divorcing her, the husband must take a vow prohibiting himself from deriving any benefit from her so that he can never remarry her. The Gemara relates an incident pertaining to this ruling: Someone named <span class="gemarra-regular">Moshe bar Atzari was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor for the marriage contract of his daughter-in-law, </span>guaranteeing the money promised by his son in the event of death or divorce. <span class="gemarra-regular">His son, </span>named <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, was a young Torah scholar, and was in financial straits. Abaye said: Is there no one who will go advise Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he should divorce his wife, and she will go and collect her marriage contract from </span>Rav Huna’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father, and then </span>Rav Huna should <span class="gemarra-regular">remarry her?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that when a husband divorces his wife in such circumstances he <span class="gemarra-regular">must take a vow </span>prohibiting himself from deriving any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">her, </span>thereby precluding the possibility of remarriage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone who divorces </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">divorces </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">in a court? </span>Rav Huna could be advised to divorce his wife outside the court, in which case he could do so without being forced to take the prescribed vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, it was revealed that </span>this Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">was a priest, </span>who may not marry a divorcée, even his own ex-wife. Abaye’s suggestion was therefore not an option for him. Upon hearing this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>is in accordance with the adage <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: Poverty follows the poor.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Abaye </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? </span>Would he really encourage giving such advice? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Abaye </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Who is a cunning, wicked person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who provides advice to sell property in accordance with </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. </span>As taught elsewhere (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 95b), if one says: My property is hereby bequeathed to you, and after you die it will pass to so-and-so, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel rules that the first recipient can sell the property, which would thereby deprive the second recipient from receiving it. Abaye said that giving advice to someone to pursue such action, though it is legally sound, is considered wicked. Here as well, why would he give advice to Rav Huna to divorce his wife only in order to force his father to pay the marriage contract?
The Gemara answers: When dealing with one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is not considered wickedness to force a father to give money to his own son. Moreover, when dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different. </span>It is not considered wickedness to procure money for a Torah scholar, because the money enables him to pursue his studies.
The Gemara asks another question with regard to this incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t </span>Moshe bar Atzari <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor? And we maintain, </span>as the Gemara will soon note, that <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor for a marriage contract does not become obligated </span>to pay. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He was an unconditional guarantor.</span>
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor for a marriage contract becomes obligated</span> to pay it <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the husband has no property </span>of his own at the time of the marriage. According to this opinion all is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. But according to the one who says: If </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>his own property the unconditional guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to pay, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>his own property <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not become obligated, what is there to say? </span>Rav Huna obviously did not have any property of his own. Why, then, was his father held responsible for paying his marriage contract according to this latter opinion?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>property when he got married, so that his father’s guarantee took effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it became blighted, </span>i.e., it was ruined or lost in the interim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">A father, vis-à-vis his son, </span>sincerely <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates himself </span>to guarantee his marriage contract, even when the son has no property of his own.
The Gemara elaborates on the issue under discussion. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated: Everyone agrees </span>that a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantor for a marriage contract does not become obligated </span>to pay the marriage contract, and <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor for a creditor, </span>i.e., for a loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to repay the loan. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an unconditional guarantor for a marriage contract and </span>a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantor for a creditor, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if the debtor</span> or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>these guarantors <span class="gemarra-regular">become obligated </span>for the guarantees they have undertaken, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not have </span>his own property the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">does not become obligated. And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the debtor or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">has</span> property <span class="gemarra-regular">or does not have </span>property, the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to pay it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor becomes obligated </span>to pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>his own property <span class="gemarra-regular">or does not have </span>property. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of a guarantor for a marriage contract, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the husband has </span>his own property <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not become obligated </span>to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The intention of the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">is to perform </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>of facilitating a marriage by encouraging the woman to consent to the marriage as a result of his involvement, but he does not truly intend to obligate himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, in contrast to a guarantor for a loan, where the creditor stands to suffer a loss if he is not repaid, the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>suffer any concrete <span class="gemarra-regular">loss, </span>as the husband does not borrow money from the woman. Therefore, the level of commitment of the guarantor in this case is lower. Accordingly, the Sages instituted that the guarantor does not become responsible for payment of the marriage contract from his own property.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who consecrated all his propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, </span>i.e., I owe one hundred dinars to so-and-so, is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed credible, </span>and the money is to be repaid to that person. The reason for this is that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a presumption</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not collude against </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple </span>treasury. He would not lie about owing money to someone, thereby causing a loss to the Temple treasury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman objects to this </span>ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does a person collude against his children? </span>Of course not. Yet, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav and Shmuel both say </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> only if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says</span> explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>him the money, the children <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>it, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>him the money, the children do <span class="gemarra-regular">not give </span>it. The person on his deathbed is not assumed to be telling the truth about owing the money unless he explicitly instructs that the money be given. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>then, it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is prone </span>to make false statements so as <span class="gemarra-regular">not to make his sons </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">sated, </span>i.e., wealthy. A person on his deathbed may falsely claim that he is in debt in order to dispel the notion that his children are wealthy heirs. 

Daf 175a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>with regard to the Temple treasury, apply the same principle and say: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person is prone </span>to make false statements so as <span class="gemarra-regular">not to make himself </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">sated. </span>It is therefore possible that the money was not owed, and payment should not be made from the consecrated property.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna say </span>that payment should be made <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of a person on his deathbed who consecrated all his property? In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor, to whom the deceased admitted owing money, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>corroborating the deceased’s admission.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav and Shmuel, </span>where the money is not given to the creditor unless the person on his deathbed explicitly requests that it be given, is applicable in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hold </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>corroborating the admission. The Gemara asks: If so, how can it be that if the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Give </span>him the money, the children <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>it to him, i.e., it is collected from the estate left to the heirs, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a loan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by oral </span>contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and as Rav and Shmuel both say: One does not collect a loan by oral </span>contract <span class="gemarra-regular">from heirs nor from purchasers </span>who bought land from the debtor after the loan was granted?
The Gemara gives a different answer to this question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> case are discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>corroborating the deceased’s admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling of Rav Huna, the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor’s promissory note has been <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified</span> by the court, and in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling of Rav and Shmuel, the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor’s promissory note has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>been <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified </span>by the court. Therefore, in the latter case, if the person on his deathbed <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Give </span>him the money, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified </span>the creditor’s promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>and if he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not say: Give </span>him the money, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not ratified </span>the creditor’s promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans </span>who inherited his property subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> We repaid </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are deemed credible. </span>But if the father said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, </span>as I owe it to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the orphans said: We repaid </span>him the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not deemed credible.</span>
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it the opposite [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelappei layya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The opposite is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable. </span>If the father <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Give one hundred dinars </span>to so-and-so, <span class="gemarra-regular">since their father stated the matter assertively, </span>as he gave an explicit directive, <span class="gemarra-regular">it could be said that </span>the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>the money. But if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, since </span>the orphans’ <span class="gemarra-regular">father did not state the matter assertively, it could be said that </span>the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">did not repay </span>the creditor.
The Gemara reformulates Rabba’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>Rabba’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, it was stated as follows: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>After his admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">Father retracted </span>his words <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to us: I repaid </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are deemed credible. What is the reason </span>for this? At first the father had forgotten, but subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">he remembered </span>repaying the debt. But if the father says assertively: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and the orphans </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">Father retracted </span>his words <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: I repaid </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not deemed credible. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if it is so that </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid </span>the debt or was uncertain about the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not say </span>with such assertiveness: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>the money to him.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person on his deathbed who, </span>upon hearing someone’s monetary claim against him, <span class="gemarra-regular">admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> owing the money to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>to two people: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are my witnesses, </span>as is usually necessary in order to prove that an admission is stated in earnest and not in jest? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>is it perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">not required </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: You are my witnesses, </span>since he is a person on his deathbed, whose instructions are generally binding? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">required that he say </span>to two people: <span class="gemarra-regular">Write </span>my admission in a document, as is usually required, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not required </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: Write </span>my admission in a document? The issue in question here is: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">jest at the time of death, </span>i.e., while on his deathbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>can it be assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not jest at the time of death?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemma, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then resolved it, </span>and ruled: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not jest at the time of death, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the statements of a person on his deathbed are considered as </span>if they were <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in a document <span class="gemarra-regular">and transmitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the relevant party.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to another by means of </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that had been sold to others by the debtor after the loan was granted. One who lends money <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without recording the loan in a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property. </span>

Daf 175b

If one <span class="gemarra-regular">presents to </span>a debtor a document in the <span class="gemarra-regular">handwriting of </span>the debtor stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that he owes </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property.</span>
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor whose </span>commitment <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged after the signing of </span>the promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the sum only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property </span>of the guarantor.
The mishna relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred where such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he said: </span>The creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the sum <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property </span>of the guarantor, but not from liened property that he has sold to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Nanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to </span>Rabbi Yishmael: The creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect </span>the sum from the guarantor at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">not from liened property </span>that has been sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from unsold property.</span>
Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why </span>not? Ben Nannas <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was strangling someone in the marketplace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> demanding repayment of a loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">found him </span>doing so and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the attacker: <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave him </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will give you </span>the money he owes, the person who intervened is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">did not loan </span>the money in the first place <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his trust </span>of the one who intervened. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, who is a guarantor who is obligated </span>to repay the loan he has guaranteed? One who tells the creditor before the loan takes place: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, and I will give you </span>the repayment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in that case the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">did loan </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his trust </span>of the guarantor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael </span>thereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One who wants to become wise should engage in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as there is no greater discipline in the Torah, and it is like a flowing spring. And, </span>he added, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wants to engage in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law should attend to, </span>i.e., become a disciple of, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Nannas.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: By Torah law, </span>a creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note or </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract, can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that has been sold by the debtor subsequent to his receiving the loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The property of a debtor at the time of the loan, even an oral loan, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liened by Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one who gives <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">only from unsold </span>property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because of the loss </span>that would be incurred <span class="gemarra-regular">by purchasers </span>of land if the seller’s creditors could seize the land they have purchased.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, a loan with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not be collected from purchasers of property, as this would cause them a loss. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a loan recorded in a promissory note, the purchasers, who neglected to investigate the financial status of the seller before purchasing land from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the loss upon themselves. </span>By contrast, loans by oral contract are often impossible to discover, even with a thorough investigation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says: By Torah law, </span>a creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note or </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract, can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">only from </span>the debtor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">unsold property. What is the reason </span>for this? The property of a debtor is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liened by Torah law. And what is the reason </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one who gives <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that has been sold? <span class="gemarra-regular">So as not to lock the door in the face of </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowers. </span>If one could not collect a debt by taking liened property that has been sold, people would be hesitant to put their money at risk by lending it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that there is a desire to encourage people to lend money by granting greater power of collection to creditors, <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be collectible from liened property that has been sold. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a loan by oral contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has no publicity </span>associated with it, so that purchasers often cannot find out about it, even after a thorough investigation, and it would be an unfair burden on them to have the property purchased by them seized in such cases.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabba </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Rabba say, </span>in the case of a firstborn son, that if he and his brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>a debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">land, he has </span>the right to receive a double portion of that payment, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected </span>a debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">money, he does not have </span>the right to a double portion? A firstborn son is entitled to a double share of inheritance of any property that was owned by his father at the time of his death, but not to profits or income that accrue to the estate after his death. If a debt owed to the father is collected from land after his death, Rabba said that the firstborn is entitled to a double portion, indicating that the land was considered in the father’s possession even before he died, which indicates that Rabba holds that the property of a debtor is liened to a creditor by Torah law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: </span>The opinions as they were cited earlier are attributed incorrectly, and it is necessary to <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>the two opinions, and exchange the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba for </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla, and</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Ulla for </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ulla say </span>elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Torah law </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a creditor is </span>to collect his debt only <span class="gemarra-regular">from inferior-quality land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara resolves the contradiction between Rabba’s two statements: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba was stating an explanation for </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">people of the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, cited earlier (125a), <span class="gemarra-regular">but he himself does not hold accordingly, </span>as he holds that a firstborn son is not entitled to a double portion of a debt collected from land.
The Gemara continues to discuss the issue of the extent of liens on a debtor’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel both say: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt only from the one who took the loan, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not from the heirs </span>of the debtor after his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not from purchasers </span>of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? They maintain that the property of a debtor is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liened by Torah law.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both say: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">both from the heirs </span>of the debtor after his death <span class="gemarra-regular">and from the purchaser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? They maintain that the property of a debtor is <span class="gemarra-regular">liened by Torah law.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rav and Shmuel from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 6:2): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was digging a pit in the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and an ox fell on him and killed him </span>as he was in the pit, the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the damage caused, as it is the one who dug the pit who is at fault. <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, if </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">that the ox died </span>as a result of the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">the heirs of the owner of the pit are liable to pay the value of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox to its owner. </span>Compensation for damages is comparable to a loan by oral contract, and yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the heirs of the culpable party must pay it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ela says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the one who dug the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>for the damage before he died, and once judgment is rendered by a court, the resulting financial liability is comparable to a loan with a promissory note.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed him </span>by falling on him. How then can one say that he stood trial? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava says: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not mean that the ox killed him instantly, but <span class="gemarra-regular">that it rendered him one who has a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and there was enough time before his death to try him and deem him liable to pay for damages.
The Gemara objects that there is a different version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> according to which this interpretation is not possible: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</span> that a certain <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with a different formulation, stating that the one who dug the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>from the impact of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ox in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">buried him </span>in the ground at the bottom of the pit? In this scenario it would be impossible to take the one who dug the pit to court to stand trial. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>according to that second version, it is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where judges sat at the opening of the pit and deemed liable </span>the one who dug the pit to pay for the damage before he died. 

Daf 176a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that when a creditor gives <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>contract, he can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the debtor after his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchaser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the debtor’s property. He can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the heirs so as not to lock the door in the face of </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowers. But he cannot collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchasers, as </span>a loan by oral contract <span class="gemarra-regular">has no publicity </span>associated with it.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">presents to </span>a debtor a document in the <span class="gemarra-regular">handwriting of</span> the debtor stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that he owes </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property. Rabba bar Natan asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>If the document in the <span class="gemarra-regular">handwriting of </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">was ratified in court </span>at a later time, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would it then be possible to collect the debt from liened property that has been sold? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if </span>the document in the <span class="gemarra-regular">handwriting of </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">was ratified in court, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">only from unsold property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</span> from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 86a), which states: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">bills of divorce </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">are not valid </span><span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">marries </span>another man on the basis of one of these bills of divorce the lineage of <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring </span>from this marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">is unflawed. </span>In other words, she is not considered to be a married woman who engaged in sexual intercourse with another man, which would impair the lineage of their child. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they are these: </span>A bill of divorce that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote in his handwritin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but there are no </span>signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses in </span>the document at all; a bill of divorce where <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>the signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses in </span>the document <span class="gemarra-regular">but there is no date </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and a bill of divorce where <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a date </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, but it contains only one witness. These are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">three bills of divorce </span>that are <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid </span>with regard to which the Sages said: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if she marries, </span>the lineage of <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring is unflawed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Even though there are no </span>signatures of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses in </span>the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he handed it to her in the presence of </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">valid </span>bill of divorce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>on the basis of this bill of divorce the woman can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the amount written to her in her marriage contract even <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that has been sold. This indicates that even when no witnesses signed the document, the debt listed therein can be collected from liened property that has been sold, as long as witnesses saw the document being transferred to the creditor. All the more so a debt listed in a document in the handwriting of the debtor that has been ratified by a court should be eligible for collection from liened property that has been sold.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated himself </span>and his property immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">from the time of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">writin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of the document, as he knew at that time that the document would be transferred in the presence of witnesses. By contrast, in the case of the mishna here, the document in the handwriting of the debtor was written without the intent of ratifying it. It was only at a later date, as an afterthought, that it was ratified, and the terms of the obligation of the debt cannot be changed at that time.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor whose</span> commitment <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged, </span>i.e., was written, <span class="gemarra-regular">after the signing of </span>the promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property of the guarantor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>If the guarantor’s commitment is written <span class="gemarra-regular">before the signing of the document, </span>the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt from the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">from liened property </span>that has been sold; if it is written <span class="gemarra-regular">after the signing of the document, </span>the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property.</span>
At other <span class="gemarra-regular">times, Rav said: Even </span>if the guarantee is written <span class="gemarra-regular">before the signing of the document, </span>the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">only from unsold property.</span>
The Gemara asks: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>resulting from the contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav to </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>as they seem to contradict one another with regard to a guarantee that is written before the signing of the document. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case, where Rav says the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property, is <span class="gemarra-regular">where it was written in </span>the document as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor, </span>as this formulation is an independent statement, and the witnesses signing the document do not necessarily relate to that statement. And <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where Rav says the creditor can collect the debt from liened property that has been sold, is <span class="gemarra-regular">where it was written in </span>the document as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so-and-so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor. </span>The usage of the conjunctive: And, causes this clause to be an integral part of the document, so that the signatures of the witnesses relate to it as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">only from unsold property. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is written in </span>the document: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so-and-so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 9:9): In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses are signed on a greeting </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bill of divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the bill of divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">signed on the greeting </span>alone, i.e., they did not intend to testify to the divorce, but only to verify that the greeting was written.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abbahu said </span>concerning this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was explained to me </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>himself that it is only when the wording of the greeting begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">Send a greeting </span>to so-and-so, that the bill of divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid, </span>as this is an independent statement and it is possible that the signatures relate to it alone. But if the wording is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And send a greeting </span>to so-and-so, the usage of the conjunctive: And, causes this clause to be an integral part of the document, and the bill of divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan himself maintains that when the conjunction is used the signatures relate to the entire document.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>when did Rabbi Yoḥanan say that the creditor can collect the debt only from the guarantor’s unsold property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Where it was written: So-and-so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor. </span>If the conjunction is used, he can collect the debt even from liened property that has been sold.
The Gemara objects: But <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, this is </span>identical to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan was presented as disagreeing with Rav. The Gemara answers: That presentation was inaccurate. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>as Rav did.
§ The mishna relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred where such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yishmael, </span>and he said: The creditor can collect the debt from unsold property of the guarantor, but not from liened property that the guarantor has sold to others. Ben Nannas said to Rabbi Yishmael: The creditor cannot collect the debt from the guarantor at all, not from liened property that has been sold, nor from unsold property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Although Rabbi Yishmael praised Ben Nannas </span>after hearing his dissenting opinion (see 175b), the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is actually <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion as he stated it initially, i.e., that in the case of a guarantee that is written after the signatures, the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property of the guarantor, but not from liened property that has been sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael say to me about </span>the case of the debtor who was being <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled, </span>as depicted by ben Nannas? Perhaps he would agree in that case, since the guarantee was given under duress, that it is not valid. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as Rabbi Yaakov says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yishmael disagreed </span>with ben Nannas <span class="gemarra-regular">also in </span>the case of the debtor being <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled.</span>
The Gemara asks: And is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion even in the case of the debtor being strangled, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with his </span>opinion in that case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when Ravin came </span>he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yishmael disagreed </span>with ben Nannas <span class="gemarra-regular">also in </span>the case of the debtor being <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">also in </span>the case of the debtor being <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>If the debtor was being <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled, and </span>in addition <span class="gemarra-regular">an act of acquisition was performed with </span>the guarantor, the guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to repay the debt. The Gemara deduces: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>it emerges <span class="gemarra-regular">that a guarantor generally does not require an act of acquisition </span>to become obligated to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>a statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says: </span>

Daf 176b

<span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor </span>who undertakes a loan guarantee <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">a court who does not require an act of acquisition; this </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">generally, </span>a guarantor <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an act of acquisition </span>in order to be obligated to pay.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor </span>who accepts responsibility for the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the giving of the money does not require an act of acquisition; </span>but if he accepts responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">after the giving of the money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an act of acquisition. </span>Moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantor </span>who undertakes a loan guarantee <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of a <span class="gemarra-regular">cour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not require an act of acquisition, as </span>in return <span class="gemarra-regular">for that gratification that </span>he experiences in that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">trusts him, he resolves to obligate himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
