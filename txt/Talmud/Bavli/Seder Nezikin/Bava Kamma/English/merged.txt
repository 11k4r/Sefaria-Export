Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four primary categories of damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which, based on a discussion in the Gemara refers either to the tooth of an animal that causes damage or to a person who causes damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Each of these categories is unique; therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of one cannot be derived from another. The defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox is not similar to </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similar to </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox. And </span>the defining characteristics of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>category of Ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a living spirit </span>that causes damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not similar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire, in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which there is no living spirit.</span>
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the defining characteristics of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>primary category of Ox and <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>primary category of Fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">typical manner </span>of their components is <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, are not similar to </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, in which </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">typical manner </span>of its components is <span class="gemarra-regular">not to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage; </span>rather, it remains in place and the damage is caused by the injured party proceeding and encountering the obstacle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The common denominator of </span>the components in all of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>primary categories is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">their typical manner to cause damage, and </span>the responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding </span>to prevent them from causing damage is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>the owner of the animal or generator of the fire or the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>a component of any of these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage, the </span>owner or generator of the component that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to pay </span>restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage with best</span>-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>its ruling employing the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Primary categories, by inference, there are</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategorie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of those primary categories. The Gemara asks: Are <span class="gemarra-regular">their subcategories similar to them, </span>i.e., to their respective primary categories, so that the same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>are they <span class="gemarra-regular">dissimilar to them?</span>
The Gemara cites additional areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> where there are primary categories and subcategories and considers the relationship between them: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to Shabbat we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 73a): <span class="gemarra-regular">The primary categories of labor </span>prohibited on Shabbat number <span class="gemarra-regular">forty-less-one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> There too, from the fact that the mishna teaches its ruling employing the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Primary categories</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inference</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategories.</span>
With regard to the primary categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">their subcategories are similar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is no different </span>if one unwittingly performed labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category, </span>for which he is liable to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, and it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no different </span>if one unwittingly performed labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> subcategory, </span>for which he is liable to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering. </span>Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is no different </span>if one intentionally performed labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for which he is liable to be executed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning, and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>if one intentionally performed labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory, </span>for which he is liable to be executed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is there between a primary category and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a subcategory? </span>The Gemara explains: The practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if one </span>unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">performs two </span>labors classified as different <span class="gemarra-regular">primary categorie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> together, </span>during a single lapse of awareness, or, <span class="gemarra-regular">alternatively, </span>if one unwittingly performs <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>labors classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategories </span>of two different primary categories <span class="gemarra-regular">together, </span>during a single lapse of awareness, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable </span>to bring a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every </span>labor that he performed. Each primary category of labor is an independent transgression. <span class="gemarra-regular">While if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span>a labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>another labor classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">its subcategory </span>during a single lapse of awareness, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">only one </span>sin-offering.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, who deems one liable </span>to bring two sin-offerings even if one performs a labor classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory </span><span class="gemarra-regular">together with </span>a labor that is <span class="gemarra-regular">its primary category, why is</span> one labor <span class="gemarra-regular">characterized </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary categor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the other labor <span class="gemarra-regular">characterized </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory? </span>The Gemara explains: Of the labors prohibited on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a significant </span>labor <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Tabernacle, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">characterized </span>it as <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a significant labor in the Tabernacle, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">characterized </span>it as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory. </span>The labors prohibited on Shabbat are derived from the labors employed in the construction of the Tabernacle; therefore, their classification is also based on their significance in its construction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to ritual impurities, we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 1:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">The primary categories of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ritual impurity </span>are as follows: Any of the eight species of <span class="gemarra-regular">the creeping anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> enumerated in the Torah (Leviticus 11:29–30), <span class="gemarra-regular">and semen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 2b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is impure </span>with impurity imparted by a human <span class="gemarra-regular">corpse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A person, a vessel, or food that is rendered impure through contact with an item classified as a primary category of ritual impurity is characterized as a subcategory. In that domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">their subcategories are dissimilar to them, as </span>any person or item classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category </span>of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">impurifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person and </span>impurifies any <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>with which it comes into contact, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>a person or item classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of ritual impurity impurifies food or drink</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but does not impurify a person or vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
After determining that there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is like that of primary categories, e.g., Shabbat, and there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is dissimilar to that of primary categories, e.g., ritual impurity, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>with regard to the laws of damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the relationship between the primary categories and their subcategories? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Papp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There are, among </span>the primary categories of damage, some whose subcategories <span class="gemarra-regular">are similar to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there are, among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>some whose subcategories <span class="gemarra-regular">are dissimilar to them.</span>
§ Seeking to clarify Rav Pappa’s statement, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that delineates the primary categories of damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Three primary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> categories </span>of damage <span class="gemarra-regular">were stated </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to an ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> An ox causes damage in three ways, and each is classified as a distinct primary category of damage represented by a part of the body of the ox: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>literally, horn. This is referring to an ox goring a person or an animal and causing damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>literally, tooth. This is referring to one’s ox causing damage by consuming another person’s produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">regel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>literally, foot. This is referring to an ox trampling another person’s belongings and causing damage. These are classified as primary categories because they are mentioned explicitly in the Torah.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring? </span>The source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <span class="gemarra-regular">goring is </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a horn, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made himself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">horns of iron, and said: So says the Lord: With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these shall you gore the Arameans, </span>until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse also <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “His firstborn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nations” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:17).
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse also <span class="gemarra-regular">states? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say</span> that the first verse cited is not a legitimate source as it is a verse from the Prophets, and <span class="gemarra-regular">we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not derive Torah matters from the texts of the tradition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Prophets and Writings, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His firstborn bull, majesty is his.”</span>
The Gemara rejects the possibility that the reason a second verse was cited is that the primary category of Goring cannot be derived from a verse in the Prophets: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is this </span>a halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">derivation? It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a mere disclosure of the matter, that goring is</span> performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with a horn. </span>A verse in the Prophets can certainly serve as a source for that disclosure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites a second verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say, </span>based on the first verse, that <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Merciful One distinguishes between </span>liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, for which the owner is liable to pay half of the damages for the first three times that it gores, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, which already gored three times and whose owner was cautioned to prevent the ox from goring, for which he is liable to pay the full damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>applies only to damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">with a detached </span>horn, like the horn of Zedekiah described in the verse, e.g., if an animal held a detached horn in its mouth and caused damage with it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>for damage that an ox caused <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a horn <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to its head, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>cases the legal status of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox and its owner is liable to pay for all of the damage.
Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> majesty is his, </span>and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations,” where the reference is to a horn attached to the ox’s head. Evidently, when an ox gores with its own horns there is a distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox.
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a subcategory of Goring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It includes any action that an ox performs with its body with the objective of inflicting damage: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pushing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">negifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], biting, crouching </span>upon items with the objective of inflicting damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and kicking.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">gorin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it is characterized </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a primary category </span>of damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>explicitly in the verse: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <span class="gemarra-italic">negifa</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be characterized as a primary category, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one man’s ox <span class="gemarra-regular">hurts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiggof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">negifa</span> mentioned in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">goring, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<span class="it-text">yiggof </span>] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">began </span>its description of the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the term <span class="gemarra-italic">negifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">concluded with </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring to say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>action <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">negifa</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>same action <span class="gemarra-regular">is goring.</span>
The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different with regard to </span>an ox goring <span class="gemarra-regular">a person that it is written: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different with regard to </span>an ox goring <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal that it is written: “If </span>one man’s ox <span class="gemarra-regular">hurts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiggof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)?
The Gemara explains: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, who has </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ingenuity </span>to defend himself and is not easily injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “If </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores,” </span>a term indicating an attack of greater force. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal, which does not have </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ingenuity </span>to defend itself and is more easily injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “If </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">hurts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiggof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>a term indicating an attack of lesser force. The term <span class="it-text">yiggof</span> is related to the term <span class="it-text">magefa</span>, meaning plague. The Torah employs that term with regard to the goring of an animal to indicate that when an animal is gored, regardless of the force of the blow, it will likely result in its death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Torah’s use of these terms <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us a matter in passing: </span>Because the effort required for the ox to gore a person to death is greater than the effort required for the ox to gore an animal to death, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>an ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to </span>goring <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to an animal. But </span>an ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to an animal is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not forewarned with regard to a person.</span>
The Gemara questions the classification in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of biting, crouching, and kicking as subcategories of Goring: Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">biting a subcategory of Eating, </span>as the animal both eats and bites with its teeth? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>in cases included in the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of damage caused by biting, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>intrinsic <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>causes, as when the ox bites forcefully, the exclusive objective of the action is to cause damage.
The Gemara asks: Aren’t <span class="gemarra-regular">crouching </span>upon items <span class="gemarra-regular">and kicking </span>items in order to damage them each <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Trampling, </span>as the animal crouches by bending its legs and kicks with its feet? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>in cases included in the primary category of Trampling, the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is commonplace, </span>as it is caused in the course of the animal’s walking; in <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases of crouching and kicking, the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is not commonplace, </span>as animals do not typically kick or crouch upon utensils.
After citing the subcategories listed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara resumes its analysis of the statement of Rav Pappa: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Pappa said: There are among them</span> some whose subcategories <span class="gemarra-regular">are dissimilar to them, to which </span>primary category was Rav Pappa referring?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that his reference was <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>subcategories of Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>that defines it as a unique primary category? What is different is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">objective </span>of the ox’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to cause damage, and </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and</span> responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>its owner. In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>subcategories of Goring, i.e., pushing [<span class="it-text">negifa</span>], biting, crouching, and kicking, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">objective </span>of the oxen’s actions <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to cause damage, and </span>the oxen are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and</span> responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Goring is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, and when Rav Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eating and Trampling.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where are Eating and Trampling written </span>in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he sends forth,” this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise it states: </span>“Happy are you that sow beside all waters <span class="gemarra-regular">that send forth the feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the ox and the donkey” </span>(Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it consumed,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and likewise it states: </span>“And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one consumes with</span>

Daf 3a

<span class="gemarra-regular">the tooth until it be all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gone” </span>(I Kings 14:10).
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> just cited: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he sends</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forth,” this </span>is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and likewise it says: </span>“Happy are you that sow beside all waters <span class="gemarra-regular">that send forth the feet of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox and the donkey” </span>(Isaiah 32:20). The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that the phrase: “And he sends forth,” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Trampling is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One writes: “That send forth the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet of the ox and the donkey.” </span>The Gemara asks: Were <span class="gemarra-regular">it not for this </span>verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would you have interpreted </span>that phrase?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>that cannot be, as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in a different verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that too cannot be, as Eating <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in a different verse. Perforce the reference is to Trampling, and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> had no need to prove this from the phrase: “That send forth the feet.”
The Gemara answers that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to cite the verse: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey,” as it <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter your mind to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: “And he sends forth,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>phrase: “And it consumed,” are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, and that </span>phrase: “And it consumed,” is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">completely destroyed, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: “And he sends forth,” is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not completely destroyed. </span>Therefore, the verse “that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the phrase “and he sends forth,” is referring to Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have interpreted </span>that the phrase “and he sends forth” is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Trampling, from where do we </span>derive that one is liable with regard to acts categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is not completely destroyed? </span>The primary category of Eating is derived from the phrase “and it consumed.” The connotation of that phrase is damage in which the object is completely destroyed.
The Gemara answers: It is derived because the category of Eating is juxtaposed to and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the category <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Just as </span>with regard to liability for the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, it is no different </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> completely destroyed and it is no different </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the object</span> damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is not completely destroyed; so too, </span>with regard to liability for the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, it is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is completely destroyed and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no different </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">the object </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">is not completely</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> destroyed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master said </span>in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And it consumed” </span>(Exodus 22:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating. And likewise it states: </span>“And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <span class="gemarra-regular">as one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone” </span>(I Kings 14:10). The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that the phrase “and it consumed” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Eating is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One writes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “As one consumes with the tooth until it be all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gone.” </span>The Gemara asks: Were <span class="gemarra-regular">it not for this </span>verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">would you have interpreted </span>that phrase?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>that cannot be, as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in a different verse. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, </span>that too cannot be, as Trampling, <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in a different verse. Perforce the reference is to Eating. The Gemara answers that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to cite the verse: “As one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone,” as it <span class="gemarra-regular">could enter your mind to say </span>that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: “And it consumed,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>phrase: “And he sends forth,” are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>phrase: “And it consumed,” is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>phrase: “And he sends forth,” is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the animal to cause damage. Therefore, the verse “as one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the phrase “and it consumed” is referring to Eating.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that we have interpreted </span>that the phrase “and it consumed” is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eating, from where do we </span>derive that one is liable with regard to actions categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own? </span>The primary category of Trampling is derived from the phrase “and he sends forth.” The connotation of that phrase is a case where the owner sent the animal to cause damage.
The Gemara answers: It is derived because the category of Trampling is juxtaposed to and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the category <span class="gemarra-regular">of Eating: Just as</span> with regard to liability for the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no different </span>if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the animal to cause damage and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is no different </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own, so too, </span>with regard to liability for the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no different </span>if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the animal to cause damage and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is no different </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let the Merciful One write </span>only the first phrase, <span class="gemarra-regular">“and he sends forth,” and there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would be no need </span>to write the second phrase, <span class="gemarra-regular">“and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it consumed,” as </span>the phrase “and he sends forth” <span class="gemarra-regular">connotes Trampling and connotes Eating. It connotes Trampling, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “That send forth the feet of the ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the donkey” </span>(Isaiah 32:20), and <span class="gemarra-regular">it connotes Eating, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And the teeth of animals I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will send forth against them” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:24).
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If not for the additional </span>phrase in the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>“and it consumed,” <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that the verse refers <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>category of damage <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>category of damage: It refers <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, where its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage is </span>commonplace, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where there is pleasure</span> for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>both interpretations <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>validity, <span class="gemarra-regular">let both of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them come </span>and be derived from the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them will you exclude? </span>Since there is no reason to prefer one category over the other, perforce both are derived, and the phrase “and it consumed” is unnecessary. The Gemara answers: The additional phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary, </span>as it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>of liability <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the animal to cause damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own, </span>the owner would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable for the damage. Therefore, the phrase “and it consumed” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the owner is liable even in a case where the ox went and caused damage on its own.
Having clarified the sources for the primary categories of Eating and Trampling, the Gemara proceeds to identify their subcategories and to determine whether it was with regard to these primary categories of damage that Rav Pappa said: There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a subcategory of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is a case where, for example, an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">rubbed against a wall for its pleasure </span>and damaged the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it sullied produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> by rolling on it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its pleasure.</span>
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>that it is defined as a unique primary category? What is different is <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>its owner. In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>subcategories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, as well, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is pleasure </span>for the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the oxen are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>Therefore, the subcategories of Eating are not dissimilar to the primary category. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sub-category of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eating is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and when Rav Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a subcategory of Trampling.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> subcategory of Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The classification is applied in a case where, for example, an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage with its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> body, </span>not its legs, in the <span class="gemarra-regular">course of its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walking; </span>or caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hair </span>that became entangled with an object in the <span class="gemarra-regular">course of its walking; </span>or caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope that is upon it;</span> or caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bifrumbiya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its mouth; </span>or caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bell </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is around its neck.</span>
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling </span>that it is defined as a unique category? What is different is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its damage is commonplace, and </span>the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>its owner. In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>subcategories of Trampling, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, their damage is commonplace, and </span>the oxen are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding,</span> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, the subcategories of Trampling are not dissimilar to the primary category. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Trampling is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, and when Rav Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a subcategory of Pit.</span>
The Gemara examines that assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a subcategory of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pit? If we say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">primary category </span>of Pit applies when, in the public domain, one leaves an uncovered pit that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths deep, and that is the pit mentioned in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a subcategory </span>of Pit applies when one leaves an uncovered pit that is <span class="gemarra-regular">nine</span> handbreadths deep, there is no basis for that distinction, as <span class="gemarra-regular">neither nine </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">are written </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him” </span>(Exodus 21:34), <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sages have </span>an accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition </span>that a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">causes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of an animal that falls into it, but a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage </span>to an animal that falls into it but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not cause death. </span>Accordingly, the pit written in the Torah (Exodus 21:33), which mentions the death of the animal that fell therein, is ten handbreadths deep. This is classified as the primary category of Pit, and a pit nine handbreadths deep is its subcategory.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, this </span>pit that is ten handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">is a primary category </span>of damage with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and that </span>pit that is nine handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> primary category </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rav Pappa’s statement: There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, was stated in reference <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> these subcategories of Pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">His stone, his knife, or his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> load</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> any of <span class="gemarra-regular">which he placed in a public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain </span>as obstacles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they caused damage </span>when people stumbled upon them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where one is liable for damage caused by these obstacles? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one declared </span>these items <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, both according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>cited later in the Gemara, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>as both Rav and Shmuel agree that any obstacle declared ownerless by its owner that causes damage in the public domain is a subcategory of Pit. 

Daf 3b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not declare them ownerless, there is still a difficulty. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Rav Pappa’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who says: We learned </span>that one is liable for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>obstacles that he places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s pit,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit. And if </span>Rav Pappa’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says: We learned </span>that one is liable for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>obstacles that he places in a public domain that he did not declare ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> that gored another animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox. </span>With regard to the subcategories of Ox, the Gemara already established that their legal status is like that of the primary category of Ox.
The Gemara asks concerning an obstacle that is a subcategory of Pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>that it is defined it as a unique category? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that its initial formation, </span>i.e., the digging of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>done in a manner that can <span class="gemarra-regular">result in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>subcategories of Pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, their initial formation, </span>i.e., the placement of the obstacle in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>done in a manner that can <span class="gemarra-regular">result in damage, and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. Rather, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Pit is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, and when Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a subcategory of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The meaning of the term <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is not clear; therefore, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the primary category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> to whose subcategories the Gemara referred? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>is the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, </span>this cannot be Rav Pappa’s intent. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eating is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating? </span>Clearly, Rav Pappa was not referring to subcategories of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, </span>which includes damage caused by a person, not by his property or animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">what primary categories and what subcategories are there in </span>that category? The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same with regard to all damage that a person causes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that there is a distinction: The <span class="gemarra-regular">primary category </span>is a case where one causes damage while <span class="gemarra-regular">awake, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory </span>is a case where one causes damage while <span class="gemarra-regular">asleep; but didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (26a): The legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>that of one <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he is liable for any damage that he causes, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> awake and </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he is asleep? </span>Accordingly, that is not the distinction between a primary category and a subcategory.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perhaps Rav Pappa was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>cases where one causes damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">his phlegm or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his spittle. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where one would be liable for damage in that case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>his phlegm and spittle <span class="gemarra-regular">cause damage as they were movin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> through the air after the person expectorated, that <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>and there is no room to distinguish between the damage that it caused and any other damage caused by one’s direct action. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case where his phlegm or spittle causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">after it comes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> res</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on the ground, e.g., if one slipped in the spittle, fell, and was injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">both according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and according to Shmue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>as the spittle is an ownerless obstacle in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and when Rav Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them; he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a subcategory of Fire.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a subcategory of Fire? If we say </span>that it is a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his stone, his knife, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his load</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where he placed them on top of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his roof, and they fell </span>off the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">by means</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a common wind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they caused damage, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are the circumstances </span>in which one would be liable for the damage that was caused? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>those items <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage as they were moving </span>through the air propelled by the wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire.</span>
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire </span>that defines it as a unique category? What is different is <span class="gemarra-regular">that another force, </span>the wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">is involved with </span>the fire in causing damage, as the wind causes the fire to spread, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>subcategories of Fire <span class="gemarra-regular">too, another force is involved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the items placed on the roof and causes damage, as the wind causes them to fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. Rather, </span>it is apparent that the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Fire is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire, and when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a subcategory </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: A subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling? But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">establish that </span>the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Trampling is similar to </span>that of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling? </span>The Gemara explains: Rav Pappa was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one’s liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">pebble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in a case where they were inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned through traditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and not explicitly written in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it is a unique halakhic category and the payment is different, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is it characterized </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Trampling? </span>The Gemara explains: It is due to the fact that it shares a common aspect with Trampling. One whose animal propels pebbles while it walks and thereby causes damage is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>half of the damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality</span> property, and he does not pay only from the body of his animal, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning half the cost of the damage paid by the owner of an innocuous ox that gored a person or an animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rava raise a dilemma</span> with regard to that matter? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava raised a dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to one’s liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>propelled by the foot of his animal, does <span class="gemarra-regular">one pay </span>damages exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his ox that caused the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">one pay </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property?
The Gemara explains: Although <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for Rava, it is obvious to Rav Pappa </span>that one pays from his superior-quality property, and in that sense, he classified the pebbles that cause damage as a subcategory of Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava, who raises it as a dilemma, why is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it characterized </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Trampling </span>when its legal status is different both in terms of the extent of one’s liability and in terms of the manner of payment? The Gemara explains: It is classified as a subcategory of Trampling in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt </span>from liability pebbles that cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>just as damage in the category of Trampling is exempt in the public domain.
§ One of the primary categories of damage enumerated in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>another is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that </span>is the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, </span>which includes a person who causes damage, but not the property or animal of a person that causes damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>is the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, as it is written: “The watchman said: Morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has come, and also night; if you will inquire [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tivayun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], inquire [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’ayu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Isaiah 21:12). The terms “<span class="it-text">tivayun</span>” and “<span class="it-text">be’ayu</span>,” meaning inquire, refer to a person, who is able to inquire. Accordingly, <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> relates to an action performed by a person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, as it is written: “How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Esau searched out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neḥpesu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; how are his hidden places </span><span class="gemarra-regular">revealed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nivu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Obadiah 1:6)? The terms <span class="it-text">nivu</span> and <span class="it-text">maveh</span> share a common root. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred </span>that <span class="it-text">nivu</span> connotes Eating? The Gemara explains that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yosef translate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the verse into Aramaic: <span class="gemarra-regular">How is Esau searched out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itbelish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> how are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his hidden places revealed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itgaleyan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The meaning of the Aramaic term <span class="it-text">itgaleyan</span> means revealed, and that is the meaning of the Hebrew term “<span class="it-text">nivu</span>.” <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> references the animal’s teeth, which are covered when its mouth is closed and revealed when it eats.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel? </span>The Gemara explains that Rav could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you: Is it taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-italic">Niveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="it-text">Niveh</span> is the passive form of the word <span class="it-text">maveh</span>, which would be the appropriate form if the reference was to teeth that are revealed. The term in the mishna is <span class="it-text">maveh</span>, an active form of the verb.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not say </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to the category of Man, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>The Gemara explains that Shmuel could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Is it taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-italic">Bo’eh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="it-text">Bo’eh</span> is a form of the word <span class="it-text">maveh</span> connoting an action taken directly, which would be appropriate were the reference to one’s actions that cause damage. The term in the mishna is <span class="it-text">maveh</span>, which connotes an action that one causes another to take.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">After all, the </span>meaning of the term in the <span class="gemarra-regular">verses is not precise according to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not precise according to </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Shmuel. It is apparent that their dispute is not based upon their interpretation of the verses; it must be based on another issue. The Gemara asks again: As for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel? </span>The Gemara explains: Rav holds that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox </span>in the mishna. This includes damage caused by an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and all matters </span>involving damaging actions <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>are completed by <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, </span>i.e., the actions included in the categories of Goring, Eating, and Trampling. Perforce, <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to a different category of damage, i.e., Man.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel too, </span>who interpreted <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> as Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox, </span>which should include all matters involving damaging actions that are completed by an ox? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that according to Shmuel, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches Ox </span>specifically with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage caused with <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> horn, and </span>it teaches <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage caused with <span class="gemarra-regular">its tooth. And </span>when the mishna contrasts Ox with <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, where there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>inherent <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not similar to </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>

Daf 4a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">re’i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where it is not the objective of </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause damage, is not similar to </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, where the objective </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is to cause damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it </span>possible to derive Goring from Eating by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where it is not the objective of </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause damage, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, where the objective of </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cause damage, </span>should the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>be liable? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary </span>for the Torah to state the case of Goring, as it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that the owner is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as he is </span>exempt in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">slave or maidservan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> causes damage. When <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or maidservant </span>causes damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">although</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their objective is to cause damage, even so </span>their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt </span>from liability; and <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>when one’s animal causes damage, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different. </span>To dispel this notion, the Torah explicitly states that one is liable for damage caused by the primary category of Goring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slave or maidservant </span>causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> substantial reason </span>to exempt the master? In that case there is concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps his master will provoke hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in retribution <span class="gemarra-regular">he will go and set fire to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another’s stack </span>of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>slave <span class="gemarra-regular">renders his master liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> ten thousand dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">each day. </span>Therefore, there is no basis for the notion that an ox that gores would be exempt just as a slave is exempt, as perhaps, fundamentally, one is liable to pay for damage caused by his slave. A master is exempt from payment to prevent a situation where a slave would exploit that situation to take revenge against his master.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">refutes </span>any possibility to derive the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Ox from <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> or <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> from Ox in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner: The <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">objective</span> of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is to cause damage, is not similar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is not the objective of </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, is not similar to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, where there is no pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
According to Rav Yehuda’s explanation of Shmuel’s opinion, among the primary categories of damage caused by an ox, the mishna mentions only Goring and Eating. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling; </span>did the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">omit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>from the mishna? The Gemara answers: The principle stated in general terms at the end of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>a component of any of these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">causes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage, the </span>owner or generator of the component that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage is obligated </span>to remit payments of restitution for damage with best-quality land, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the intent of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is to teach the primary category of Trampling as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him teach it explicitly. </span>Accordingly, Rav Yehuda’s explanation of how Shmuel interprets the mishna is rejected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that according to Shmuel, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ox </span>specifically with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>actions that cause damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">its foot and </span>it teaches <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>actions that cause damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">its tooth. And </span>when the mishna contrasts Ox with <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying: </span>The defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where its damage is commonplace, is not similar to </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its damage is not commonplace, and </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, where there is pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not similar to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, where there is no pleasure </span>for the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
According to Rav Yehuda’s explanation of Shmuel’s opinion, among the primary categories of damage with regard to an ox, the mishna mentions only Goring and Trampling. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But what </span>of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring; </span>did the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">omit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>from the mishna? The Gemara answers: The principle stated in general terms at the end of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when </span>a component of any of these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the </span>owner or generator of the component that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is obligated </span>to remit payments of restitution for damage with best-quality land, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the intent of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is to teach the primary category of Goring as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him teach it explicitly. </span>The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>those categories of damage where the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the outset </span>and the owner is liable to pay for the entire damage the first time his animal causes damage that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>those categories of damage where the animal is initially <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>and the owner is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage caused by his animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately forewarned, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak </span>of them. With regard to Goring, the first three times an ox gores a person or an animal the owner of the ox pays only half of the damages. This is because an ox is considered forewarned with regard to damage categorized as Goring only after it attacks three times.
After addressing the reason that Rav did not say that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to Eating in accordance with the explanation of Shmuel, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to Man, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>Shmuel could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you, if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, isn’t it taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter clause </span>of the mishna (15b): Both <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forewarned ox, and an ox that causes damage in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>any damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">man? </span>Apparently, Man was mentioned in the latter clause of the mishna because it was not mentioned in the first clause.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>Man among the primary categories of damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first clause. </span>The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>those categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body, </span>the category of Man, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, too, </span>the same difficulty arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>damage caused by a <span class="gemarra-regular">man taught in the latter clause </span>of the mishna? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you: That </span>mention of damage caused by a man in the latter clause <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to enumerate </span>that damage <span class="gemarra-regular">together</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the other forms of damage in a case where the owner of the cause of damage or the generator of that damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the statement in the mishna: The defining characteristic of the primary category of Ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not similar to </span>the defining characteristic of the primary category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox, where </span>if the ox kills a person the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the ranso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to the heirs of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, where </span>one who kills another <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>for killing him; rather, if he killed him unwittingly he is exiled and if he did so intentionally he is executed. And the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, where </span>if one injures another <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity, </span>i.e., pain, humiliation, medical costs, and the loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not similar to </span>the defining <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox, where </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of indemnity </span>and is liable to pay only the cost of the damage.
The Gemara questions Rav’s understanding that Ox, as mentioned in the mishna, includes all actions an ox performs that cause damage, including goring, based on the continuation of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The common denominator of </span>the components in all <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>primary categories of damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to cause damage. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox to cause damage </span>by goring? The Gemara answers: The statement in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause damage </span>by goring? The Gemara answers: Yes, <span class="gemarra-regular">once it was forewarned </span>after goring repeatedly, <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner is </span>to cause damage by goring.
The Gemara questions Rav’s understanding that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is the primary category of Man: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to cause damage? </span>The Gemara answers: The statement in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to </span>the damage one causes while <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause damage </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">contracts and extend</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> his limbs while sleeping, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>to damage objects placed next to him.
If <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is referring to Man, is it correct to state, as the mishna does in its enumeration of common denominators of the primary categories: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding </span>is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you? </span>That formulation is appropriate in cases where one is safeguarding another person, animal, or item. When applied to the primary category of Man, it would indicate that responsibility to safeguard one person is incumbent upon another person. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">man, </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding his body</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him </span>alone, not upon anyone else.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, </span>that the formulation: And their safeguarding is incumbent upon you, indicates that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is not Man, there is a difficulty with <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Karn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four primary categories of damage, and Man is one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues and states that one common denominator is: Their safeguarding is incumbent upon you. With regard to that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the same question arises: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding his body is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>not upon anyone else, and the wording of Karna is imprecise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Abbahu said to the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who was reciting the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the study hall: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: And with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding his body is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him; </span>

Daf 4b

<span class="gemarra-regular">here too, teach </span>the mishna: And with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">man, </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding his body</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari objects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">water, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “As when fire ignites brushwood; fire boils [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] water”</span> (Isaiah 64:1). The terms <span class="it-text">tiveh</span> and <span class="it-text">maveh</span> share a common root, and the reference is to water. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Water boils [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nivu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>from fire, with water, a plural noun in Hebrew, the subject of the intransitive plural verb, <span class="it-text">nivu</span>? No, <span class="gemarra-regular">“fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boils [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] water” is written, </span>and since <span class="it-text">tiveh</span> is a transitive singular verb, the subject is fire, which is a singular noun. Therefore, no proof can be adduced from this verse that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> refers to an action performed with water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid objects to </span>the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as when </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” is written </span>in the verse cited by Rav Mari, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Fire. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>is the meaning when the mishna enumerates the primary categories of damage: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire, </span>indicating that they are two distinct categories? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you would say </span>that these are not two distinct categories but rather the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is explaining </span>the meaning of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, </span>why does the mishna say: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>primary categories of damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">three.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would say </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is Fire, and there are four categories in the mishna, as the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox, in which there are two </span>primary categories of damage, Eating and Trampling, the mishna remains difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> in the mishna is referring to Fire, what is the meaning of that which the mishna states with regard to the common denominator of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> and Ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the defining characteristics of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>category of Ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a living spirit, </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>similar to the defining characteristic of the next category in the mishna, in which there is no living spirit. Accordingly, how can <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> mean Fire; <span class="gemarra-regular">what living spirit is there in Fire? And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, </span>if <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is Fire, what is the meaning of the next phrase in the mishna: They <span class="gemarra-regular">are not similar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire, </span>in which there is no living spirit. Clearly, <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is not Fire.
§ Contrary to the mishna, where four primary categories of damage were enumerated, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:1) that there are <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen primary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> categories of damage. </span>The thirteen categories consist of four bailees, five types of indemnity, and the four primary categories listed in the mishna. The four bailees are: The <span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who is liable for damage caused by his negligence; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the borrower, </span>who is liable for all damage; the <span class="gemarra-regular">paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the renter, </span>who is liable if the object is lost or stolen. The five types of indemnity one is liable to pay for injuring another person are: <span class="gemarra-regular">Damage, </span>i.e., the decrease in the injured party’s value; <span class="gemarra-regular">pain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and medical costs; loss of livelihood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and humiliation </span>that the injured party suffered from the assault. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">the four </span>primary categories enumerated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, that </span>is a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach these </span>nine categories and enumerates only four? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>who says that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is Eating, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks. With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak, </span>and the additional categories of Rabbi Oshaya are damage caused by one’s body. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>who says that <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> is Man, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>these nine categories as well. The Gemara answers: According to Rav, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, and </span>included in that category are <span class="gemarra-regular">all matters </span>of damage that are caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">man, </span>among them the categories added by Rabbi Oshaya.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Oshaya too, doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man? </span>Why then did he enumerate the four bailees and the five types of indemnity? The Gemara answers: In his enumeration, Rabbi Oshaya distinguishes between <span class="gemarra-regular">two types </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a man: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a man who injures </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">person, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the primary category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, which involves the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man who damages an ox </span>or damages other property belonging to another person.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox as well, let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him teach two categories of Ox. Let him teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that damages an ox </span>or other property belonging to another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that injures a person.</span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who damages </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>or other property, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays</span> merely for the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage; </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who injures </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">person, he pays </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">four types </span>of indemnity payments: Pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox that damages an ox </span>or other property belonging to another person and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that injures a person? </span>In both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>merely for the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Therefore, unlike a case where a person causes the damage, there is no reason to distinguish between cases where an ox causes damage based on the victim of that damage.
With regard to the assertion that Rabbi Oshaya added only cases involving a man who injures another person, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But aren’t </span>there the categories of the <span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee and the borrower, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">paid bailee and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renter, which are </span>categories that describe <span class="gemarra-regular">a man who damages </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>or other property, as the cases referred to by Rabbi Oshaya are those where the bailee fails to return the deposit that he was entrusted to safeguard? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>each type of bailee as distinct categories and does not include them under the rubric of Man, one of the four categories enumerated in the mishna.
The Gemara answers that the reason why Rabbi Oshaya enumerates Man separately from the bailees is that he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>one category, Man, referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that </span>is engendered <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action, </span>e.g., the five types of indemnity payments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the four bailees, referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that occurs on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own, </span>e.g., failure of the four bailees to safeguard the deposit.
The Gemara cites a third listing of primary categories of damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches </span>that there are <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four primary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> categories of damage: Payment of double </span>the principal, paid by a thief who is apprehended and convicted based on the testimony of witnesses and who does not admit his crime; <span class="gemarra-regular">and payment of four or five </span>times the principal, paid by a thief who steals an ox or sheep, respectively, and then slaughters or sells it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>payment of the principal, by <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>who admits his crime; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> robber, who </span>steals openly and by force or threat of violence; <span class="gemarra-regular">and conspiring witnesses </span>who pay the individual against whom they falsely testified with regard to a sum that they conspired to cause him to lose.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the rapist, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seducer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who seduces an unmarried young woman, who pay a fine of fifty <span class="it-text">sela</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the defamer, </span>i.e., one who defames his wife by claiming falsely in court that he discovered that she was not a virgin when he consummated the marriage and alleges that she engaged in intercourse with another man while betrothed, who pays a fine of one hundred <span class="it-text">sela</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who causes </span>another’s <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to become ritually impure, </span>rendering it prohibited to partake of that <span class="it-text">teruma</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who mixes </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> with another’s non-sacred food, rendering it prohibited for any non-priest to partake of it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pours </span>another’s wine <span class="gemarra-regular">as a libation </span>for idolatry. When one combines the eleven categories enumerated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and these thirteen </span>categories enumerated by Rabbi Oshaya, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>totals <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>principal categories of damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not teach these </span>eleven additional categories? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>cases where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>that Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks. With regard to </span>cases where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> speak.</span>
The Gemara asks: What of the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thief and a robber, which </span>are cases where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Let </span>Rabbi Oshaya also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>those cases and include them in his list. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t he teach </span>those cases, as he enumerates in his list the <span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee and the borrower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>An unpaid bailee who takes a false oath that the deposit was stolen, when in fact it remained in his possession, is liable to pay restitution like a thief.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t he teach </span>those cases; as he enumerates in his list the <span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee and the borrower? </span>Why does Rabbi Ḥiyya list them separately? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥiyya makes a distinction between different types of theft: He <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>cases of theft with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">property that came into </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession in a permitted </span>manner, e.g., an unpaid bailee who was entrusted with a deposit and later misappropriated it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>cases of theft with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">property that came into </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>manner, e.g., the actions of a thief and a robber. 

Daf 5a

The Gemara asks: With regard to the payment made by <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses, which is </span>categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the witnesses pay the precise sum that they conspired to cause the defendant to lose, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>Rabbi Oshaya also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach it</span> as one of the categories on his list. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">do not pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the basis of their own </span>admission. Evidently, theirs is not a payment of monetary restitution; rather, it is a fine, as only one who was found liable based on the testimony of witnesses pays a fine, not one who was found liable based on his own admission.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, let him teach two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">types of </span>categories of damage under the rubric of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox: Let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>one category for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that damages an ox </span>or other property belonging to another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that injures a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person.</span>
The Gemara explains its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">As we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna (33a): In a case where the two parties damaged each other concurrently, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that injured a person also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the difference </span>between the damage caused by his ox and the damage that the person caused the ox. Rabbi Akiva holds that if an innocuous ox injures a person, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, whereas if an innocuous ox damages another’s property then the owner is liable only for half the cost of the damage. Since the owner’s liability in the two cases is different, each case should be classified as a distinct category, and Rabbi Oshaya should list them separately in his <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t Rabbi Akiva break </span>the force of <span class="gemarra-regular">his fist </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezizeih</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he significantly tempered the force of his statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous ox that injured a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">would pay from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property and not merely from the body of his animal, as in the case of an innocuous ox that damages property; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to an ox that gores a person: “According to this judgment <span class="gemarra-regular">shall it be done to him” </span>(Exodus 21:31), from which it is derived that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>proceeds of the sale of the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not pay </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property. The mishna states that one pays restitution from his superior-quality property in instances of all primary categories of damage. Since in the case of an innocuous ox that injured a person even Rabbi Akiva concedes that the owner does not pay from his superior-quality property, it should not be included in a list of the primary categories.
The Gemara asks: As for <span class="gemarra-regular">the rapist, and the seducer, and the defamer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> all of <span class="gemarra-regular">which are </span>cases in which the offender pays <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> restitution, let </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>them as categories in his list.
The Gemara explains why Rabbi Oshaya did not teach them as separate categories: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way you </span>look at it, they should not be listed. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the payments listed by Rabbi Ḥiyya are for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused to the woman’s body, which reduces her value, he already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught it; if </span>the payments are for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain, </span>he already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught it; if </span>the payments are for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>he already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught it; if </span>the payment is for <span class="gemarra-regular">degradation, that </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which he already taught. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">have you to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say? </span>What is the nature of the payments paid by the rapist and the seducer mentioned by Rabbi Ḥiyya? In these cases, each payment paid is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kenasa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and as explained, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>cases in which one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not speak.</span>
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who causes </span>another’s <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to become ritually impure, and one who mixes </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> with another’s non-sacred food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pours </span>another’s wine <span class="gemarra-regular">as a libation </span>for idolatry, each of <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>a case in which the offender must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>to compensate the owner for his loss due to the lowered value of his food or wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>them as categories in his list.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way you </span>look at it, these cases should not be listed. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Rabbi Oshaya holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">evident</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., where the object is physically unchanged but its halakhic status is changed, <span class="gemarra-regular">is characterized as damage </span>for which one is liable to pay restitution, Rabbi Oshaya already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught, </span>i.e., included in his list, restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evident is not characterized as damage </span>for which one is liable to pay restitution, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a fine, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as explained, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>cases for which one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: Since Rabbi Ḥiyya lists these cases as distinct categories, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not evident is not characterized as damage </span>for which one is liable to pay restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were characterized as damage </span>for which one is liable to pay restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span>he already <span class="gemarra-regular">teach, </span>i.e., include in his list, restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage? </span>The Gemara rejects that suggestion: Even if he holds that damage that is evident is characterized as damage for which one is liable to pay restitution, he distinguishes between different types of damage. He <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that is evident and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage that is not evident.</span>
The Gemara considers the fact that each of the lists of primary categories is introduced with the number that they total: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>mishna, he <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the number </span>of four primary categories in introducing his list <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>those additional categories <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya. And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya taught the number </span>of thirteen primary categories <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>those additional categories <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya. But what </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the number </span>of twenty-four primary categories <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude?</span>
The Gemara answers: He taught that number in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">an informer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who provides information to the authorities leading them to confiscate another person’s property; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to exclude the case of a priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span> by performing the sacrificial rites for one offering with the intent to sacrifice it for the sake of another offering, in which case the person who brought the offering must replace it with another.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>these cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he did not include the case of a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who renders </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Perhaps, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>items, Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak. But </span>with regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an informer, what is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach it </span>and include it in his list of categories? The Gemara answers: The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an informer is different, as </span>the damage is caused through <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, and with regard to </span>damage caused through <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">does not speak.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>there the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a defamer, where </span>the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>caused through <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, and </span>yet Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span> it and includes it in his list? The Gemara answers: He includes that case because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">speech that involves an action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One who defames his wife is liable only if he made his allegation after engaging in intercourse with her.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">speech that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">involves no action, </span>as they are liable for their testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>it and includes it in his list? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, although it involves no action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the Merciful One characterizes it </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">an action, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “And you shall do to him as he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conspired to do unto his brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:19).
The Gemara considers the subcategories of the various primary categories listed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna, his terminology is understandable, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught primary categories, </span>which, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are </span>also additional forms of damage that are <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategories</span> of those primary categories. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Ḥiyya and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Oshaya, </span>why did they employ the terminology they employed? They employed the term <span class="gemarra-regular">primary categories, </span>which, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that there are subcategories. What are the subcategories </span>of the primary categories they listed? It appears that they enumerated all the various categories of damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says: </span>When Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya characterize, as primary categories, the various categories of damage that they listed, it is not to indicate that there are subcategories; rather, it is to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are characterized as primary categories, </span>in the sense that one is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay from </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">best</span>-quality property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for this, i.e., from where is it derived? The Gemara explains: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>using a verbal analogy from the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“in place of,” “giving,” “he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pay,” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“money.” </span>The term “in place of” is written with regard to a forewarned ox that gores (Exodus 21:36); “he shall give” is written with regard to an ox that kills a slave (Exodus 21:32); “he shall pay” is written with regard to the categories of damage of Eating and Trampling (Exodus 22:4); and “money” is written with regard to Pit (Exodus 21:34). The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one must pay from his best-quality property is stated explicitly in each of those four verses. In each of the twenty-four categories listed by Rabbi Ḥiyya one of those four terms is written, so by means of a verbal analogy, the requirement to pay from one’s best-quality property applies to each of them.
§ The mishna states: The defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox is not similar to</span> the defining characteristic of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-italic">Maveh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? Rav Zevid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Let the Merciful One write one</span> of the primary categories <span class="gemarra-regular">and derive the other </span>categories <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. Then </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive one </span>category <span class="gemarra-regular">from one </span>other category, as each category has its unique characteristics.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the defining characteristics of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>category of Ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> category of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is a living </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spirit, </span>are not similar to the defining characteristic of the category of Fire, in which there is no living spirit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? Rav Mesharshiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>

Daf 5b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Merciful One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>of the primary categories <span class="gemarra-regular">and derive </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>categories <span class="gemarra-regular">from them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Then </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive one </span>category <span class="gemarra-regular">from two </span>other categories, as each category has its own unique characteristics, which prevent the derivation of a new category even from a combination of two categories.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the primary categories in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">when you cast </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit among them, all </span>of the rest <span class="gemarra-regular">of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be derived through </span>an analogy based on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">common factor </span>of two categories. This is the case with all of the categories <span class="gemarra-regular">except for Goring, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to refute </span>the analogy to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of Goring with the following contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about all of </span>the other categories? They are notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that they are forewarned from their outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since it is the typical manner of the animal to trample and eat, and the typical manner of fire to burn, and the typical manner of a pit to serve as an obstacle, the owner is always forewarned with regard to safeguarding against damage and is liable to pay full damages for his failure to prevent the damage even the first time. With regard to Goring, the animal is innocuous for the first three instances of damage and only thereafter is the animal forewarned, rendering its owner liable to pay full damages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: On the contrary, Goring is superior </span>in the sense that one’s liability in a case of Goring is more apparent, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the objective of </span>the ox’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is to cause damage, even Goring </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">be derived </span>from the common factor of two sources.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if all the categories can be derived from another category and Pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did the Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One write </span>all the primary categories explicitly? The Gemara answers: It is in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>unique <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span> that apply exclusively to each category.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>is written explicitly in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish between </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Trampling </span>are written explicitly in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from liability those whose animals perform the actions in these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>is written explicitly in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt </span>one from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> caused when they fall into a pit. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who deems one liable </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>caused when they fall <span class="gemarra-regular">into a pit, </span>Pit was written in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt </span>one from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the death of <span class="gemarra-regular">a perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who was killed by falling into a pit. Rabbi Yehuda concedes that the possessor of the pit is exempt because the person who ultimately fell into the pit was capable of avoiding it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Man </span>is written explicitly in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to render him liable for four </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of indemnity, beyond the payment of damages for the diminution in value caused when one injures a person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Fire </span>is written explicitly in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt </span>one from liability for damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>object, e.g., one hidden by grain, that was consumed by fire. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to Rabbi Yehuda, who deems one liable </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage </span>done to <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>object damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">fire, to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> add what </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> does the Torah mention the category of Fire explicitly? 

Daf 6a

The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add</span> cases where the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">scorched </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed field and</span> cases in which <span class="gemarra-regular">it singed his stones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even though the damaged object remains intact and is not consumed by the fire, one is still liable to pay for the damage caused.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">The common denominator of </span>the components in all these categories is that it is their typical manner to cause damage. The Gemara asks: In order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> add what </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> is this statement cited in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>that one is liable in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his stone, his knife, or his load, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where he placed them on top of his roof, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they fell </span>off the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a common </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wind and caused damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances </span>in which one would be liable for the damage that was caused? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>those items <span class="gemarra-regular">cause damage as they are movin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> through the air propelled by the wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire.</span>
Therefore, one could claim: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire </span>that defines it as a unique category? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that another force is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">involved with it </span>in causing damage, as it is the wind that causes the fire to spread and cause damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the entity propelled by the wind is <span class="gemarra-regular">your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, another force is involved with them </span>in causing damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the objects are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>Perforce, there is no need for the common denominator in the mishna to teach the case of an object that causes damage when propelled off a roof by the wind. That case is included in the primary category of Fire that is explicitly mentioned in the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable when <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>those objects fall from the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">they come to rest </span>on the ground, and they cause damage as an obstacle on which a person or an animal stumbles. The mishna teaches that the one who placed them on the roof is liable. The Gemara questions this explanation: What are the circumstances in which one is liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one declared them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit.</span>
Therefore, one could claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>that defines it as a unique category? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that its initial formation, </span>i.e., the digging of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>done in a manner that can <span class="gemarra-regular">result in damage, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you.</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items he had placed on the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, their initial formation, </span>i.e., when the obstacle reached the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>done in a manner that can <span class="gemarra-regular">result in damage, and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">your property, and </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their safeguarding, </span>to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you. </span>Perforce, there is no need for the common denominator in the mishna to teach the case where the objects fell from the roof, came to rest in the public domain, and were declared ownerless.

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did not declare them ownerless. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel, who says: We learned </span>that one is liable to pay for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>obstacles that one places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The question remains: What <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does the common denominator in the mishna teach?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna teaches one’s liability in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one declared</span> the objects <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, and </span>even if he declared them ownerless, those objects <span class="gemarra-regular">are not similar to </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit. What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that there is no other force</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> involved with it </span>in causing the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Will you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to these </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">another force involved with it </span>in causing the damage, i.e., the wind that propelled them from the roof to rest on the ground?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Pit in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prove </span>that this factor, that there is another force involved with the object in causing the damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as although there is another force involved in the spreading of a fire, one is liable for the damage the fire causes, so the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to these objects can be derived from that of Fire.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Fire: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about Fire? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Will you say the same with regard to these objects propelled by the wind into the public domain, where it is not their typical manner to proceed and cause damage? Accordingly, how can one learn the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case from that of Fire?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Fire in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit will prove </span>that the lack of this characteristic, of a typical manner being to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt the owner of the objects from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as Pit and Fire each prove that the defining characteristic of the other is not decisive in establishing liability or exemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">the derivation has reverted </span>to its starting point, and liability in these cases is derived from the common denominator of Pit and Fire. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> add </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit where </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">is rolle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet of a person or the hooves of an animal.</span> This is a case where one placed an obstacle in a public domain and the obstacle caused no damage where it was placed, but subsequently was kicked by passersby to a different location where it caused damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which one is liable for damage in that case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one declared </span>the objects <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, both according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rav and according to Shmuel this is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit.</span>
Therefore, one could claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>that it is defined as a unique category?

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did not declare </span>the objects <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel, who says: We learned </span>that one is liable for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>obstacles that one places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s pit, this is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit. </span>What <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does the common denominator in the mishna teach?

The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Pit in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox will prove </span>that this fact, that one’s actions do not cause the damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as although the owner’s actions do not cause the ox to cause damage, one is liable for the damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about Ox? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>it is the typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of the animals in these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span> By contrast, in the case of the obstacle kicked by passersby to a different location where it caused damage, it is not its typical manner to proceed and cause damage.

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ahava said: </span>The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable to pay damages in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">that is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all those </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span> engage in activities that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>are permitted, i.e., those who <span class="gemarra-regular">open their gutter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and drain the sewage from their houses into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>those who <span class="gemarra-regular">flush out </span>the water from <span class="gemarra-regular">their caves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where foul-smelling water was stored, into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the summer they do not have permissio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to do so, while <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rainy season they have permission </span>to do so, since the street is rained upon in any event and thereby washed.

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which one is liable for damage caused by the sewage? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the sewage <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage as it is moving, </span>after he poured it into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action, </span>and it is no different from any other damage caused by a person. According to Rav, it is under the rubric of <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> in the mishna. According Shmuel it appears in the next mishna, and it is not derived from the common denominator mentioned in the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is in a case where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the sewage <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to rest </span>on the floor, e.g., a passerby slipped on it.

Daf 6b

The Gemara suggests: The primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox will prove </span>that this fact, that the ox, i.e., the cause of the damage, entered the public domain with permission, is not a reason to exempt its owner from payment, as that is the nature of the primary category of Ox, and one is liable for damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ox? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>it is the typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of the animals in these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>By contrast, in the case of the sewage, it is not its typical manner to proceed and cause damage.

The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Ox in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit will prove </span>that the lack of this characteristic, of the typical manner being to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit.

This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said:</span> The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is liable to pay damages in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">that we learned </span>in a mishna (117b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall or a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that fell </span>on its own <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and caused damage, </span>the owner of the wall or tree is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying </span>damages because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. But if the court had sensed the potential danger and had <span class="gemarra-regular">allotted him </span>a certain amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>during which he was obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to chop </span><span class="gemarra-regular">down the tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to demolish the wall, </span>and he had not yet done so, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wall or tree <span class="gemarra-regular">fell </span>into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span>allotted <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and caused damage, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying damages.

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one declared </span>the fallen tree or wall <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel, this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a subcategory of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit.

The Gemara suggests: The primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox will prove </span>that this factor, of not being initially formed in a manner that can result in damage, is not a reason to exempt its owner from payment, as that is the nature of the primary category of Ox, i.e., an ox is not born in a manner that results in damage, and one is liable for damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about Ox? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>it is the typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of the animals in these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed </span>from one place to another <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>By contrast, in the case of the tree and wall, it is not their typical manner to proceed and cause damage.

§ The mishna states: And <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>a component of any of these categories <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage, the </span>owner or generator of the component that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage is obligated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to pay restitution with best-quality land. The Gemara asks: Why does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna use the unusual expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one liable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the damage is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥav</span> to pay? He should have used the more standard expression for liability: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one liable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the damage is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayyav</span> to pay. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jerusalemite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who teaches </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">a light </span>and concise <span class="gemarra-regular">formulation, </span>as <span class="it-text">ḥav</span> is more concise than <span class="it-text">ḥayyav</span>.
§ The mishna continues: The owner or generator of the component that caused damage is obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>restitution for damage with best-quality land. The one liable for the damage is indebted <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>with his superior-quality land. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah states with regard to paying damages: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the best of his field, and of the best of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his vineyard he shall pay” </span>(Exodus 22:4). What is the meaning of “his field” and “his vineyard”? It refers to that property of the injured party; the one liable for the damage pays from land of a quality that is commensurate to <span class="gemarra-regular">the best</span>-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">field of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the best</span>-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party, even if the property he damaged was of a lesser quality; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse comes only to </span>allow <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from superior-quality </span>land belonging to the one liable for the damage, in the event that he has no money or movable property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property collects from superior-quality land.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span>if one’s animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>garden bed, it is understandable that he <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay </span>the injured party the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>garden bed. But if it <span class="gemarra-regular">ate</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>garden bed, is it reasonable that he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>garden bed? While this is the straightforward meaning of his statement, it is untenable, as he would be paying more than the value of the damage he caused.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: With what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal that caused the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from one <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bed among </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">garden beds, and we do not know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whether it ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">or it ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>one. In such a case, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the animal’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the injured party the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>raised a question and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: And if we would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>garden bed, its owner would have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay only </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>garden bed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that we do not know</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>garden bed or <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a rich </span>garden bed, is it reasonable that he should have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rich </span>garden bed? There is a general principle governing monetary disputes that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof falls on the claimant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, so long as the injured party cannot prove that the animal ate from the rich garden bed, he should not be entitled to collect the value of such a garden bed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Aḥa bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov said: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>after appraising the damage, the court comes to collect from the one liable for the damage, but he does not have money available to pay for the damage. And the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iddit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the best land, <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equal </span>in quality <span class="gemarra-regular">to the inferior-quality </span>land<span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the one liable for the damage also has land of superior quality.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree with regard to this: Rabbi Yishmael holds: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We appraise </span>the value of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party, and therefore the one liable for the damage can pay with his inferior-quality fields, which are equal in quality to the best fields owned by the injured party. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva holds: We appraise </span>the value of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and have him pay with his fields of superior quality.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yishmael? </span>The word <span class="gemarra-regular">“field” is stated below, </span>toward the end of the verse: “Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay” (Exodus 22:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“field” is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">stated above, </span>at the beginning of that same verse: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another.” <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">field which is stated above </span>belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too the field stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva </span>holds: When the verse says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of the best of his field and of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">best of his vineyard he shall pay,” </span>it means from the best <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is paying, </span>i.e., from the best fields belonging to the one liable for the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael </span>respond to this? The <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy </span>between the two instances of the word “field” <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective, and</span> the straightforward meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verbal analogy is effective, as I stated. </span>It serves to teach that when it says that he pays from the best of his field, it means from land equal in quality to the best field owned by the injured party.
And the straightforward meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective, </span>as it serves to teach a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable for the damage has superior-quality </span>land<span class="gemarra-regular"> and inferior</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality </span>land<span class="gemarra-regular">, and the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">has inferior-quality </span>land<span class="gemarra-regular">, and the inferior-quality </span>land<span class="gemarra-regular"> of the one liable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the damage is not as good as the superior-quality</span> land<span class="gemarra-regular"> of the injured </span>party. In this case, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">from his best </span>land, i.e., from the superior-quality land that he owns.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>legally <span class="gemarra-regular">unable to say to him: You </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">collect from </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land. He cannot say this because the standard for classifying land as being of superior-quality is set according to the injured party’s superior-quality land, and the inferior-quality land of the one liable for the damage is of a lower quality than that. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>his damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">best</span>-quality land of the one liable for the damage.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse comes only to </span>allow <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from superior-quality </span>land belonging to the one liable for the damage, in the event that he has no money or movable property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property collects from superior-quality land. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference from ordinary damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage involving the <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property? To which case does this refer?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">our ox, </span>i.e., an ox belonging to a Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">gored an ox that is consecrated </span>property, there is a difficulty, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states: </span>“And if one man’s ox hurts the <span class="gemarra-regular">ox of another” </span>(Exodus 21:35). This teaches that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only if the ox hurt an ox belonging to another Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not</span> if it hurt <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is consecrated </span>property. In the latter case no damages are collected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we say that the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is referring not to a case of damage but <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who </span>vows and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: It is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to donate <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dinars for Temple maintenance. </span>And the inference teaches that if the one who took the vow has no money, then the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">treasurer comes and collects </span>the hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land.
The Gemara challenges this understanding: The Temple treasurer <span class="gemarra-regular">should not </span>be treated any better than an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor, </span>

Daf 7a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>is to collect only <span class="gemarra-regular">from intermediate-quality</span> land, not from superior-quality land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the money owed him <span class="gemarra-regular">from superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>there is still a difficulty; the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">be refuted</span> in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor? </span>He is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his power with regard to payment of damages, </span>as an ordinary person can collect payment of damages for loss or injury caused by another’s ox. But <span class="gemarra-regular">can you say </span>the same about the Temple treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property, with regard to which the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">weakened its power with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to payment of damages, </span>not allowing it to collect such compensation? Accordingly, even if a creditor collects from superior-quality land, it does not necessarily follow that a Temple treasurer would also do so. It is therefore apparent that Rabbi Akiva’s <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is not referring to the case of one who donates money to the Temple.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>we can explain that we are dealing here with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where our ox gored an ox that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is consecrated </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>posed <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for you </span>about this explanation, i.e., that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states: “</span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">ox of another” </span>(Exodus 21:35), which indicates that liability is incurred only for damaging another person’s ox <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox consecrated </span>to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>disagrees with that interpretation and <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Menasya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Menasya says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is consecrated </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">gored an ox belonging to a common person [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Temple treasury is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. By contrast, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a common </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person that gore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ox that is consecrated </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the ox that gored the other ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox, i.e., an ox with no consistent history of causing damage with the intent to injure, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, i.e., an ox whose owner was forewarned because his ox had already gored another ox three times, the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, from where </span>do you know to say that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the superior-quality </span>land belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the inferior-quality </span>land belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage </span>are equal in quality, and the one liable for the damage also has land of superior quality, as the dispute was previously interpreted by Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps everyone, </span>including Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we appraise </span>the value of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here they disagree with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, </span>that in the case of damage caused by the ox of a common person to the property of the Temple treasury, compensation is collected from superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael holds in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>that the owner of the ox bears no liability. In other words, perhaps in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> recording the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva (see 6b), Rabbi Yishmael first taught that land is appraised based on the quality of the injured party’s land, and then, although it is not explicit in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, he continued to state his opinion that the Temple treasury is unable to collect damages. Accordingly, Rabbi Akiva can be understood as having first expressed his agreement concerning the valuation of land and then proceeding to dispute Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion with regard to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is so </span>that this is the disagreement, then <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is the meaning of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes only </span>to allow injured parties to collect compensation from superior-quality land? This indicates that Rabbi Akiva disagrees about how to understand this verse.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if the subject is the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property collects from superior-quality land. If, as suggested, Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, then he maintains that damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently than damage to another person’s property, in that if one’s ox damages consecrated property one is liable for the full cost of the damage even if the ox was considered innocuous. If damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently, there is no basis to derive an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught explicitly </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The best of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his field and the best of his vineyard he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pay” </span>(Exodus 22:4), teaches that the appraisal is of <span class="gemarra-regular">the best of the field of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the best of the vineyard of the injured </span>party. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The appraisal is of <span class="gemarra-regular">the best of the field </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the best of the vineyard of the one liable for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>This clearly indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva compensation is collected from the superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage.
§ The Gemara considers others issues concerning the form in which restitution should be paid: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises a contradiction </span>and addresses it <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “The best of his field and of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> best of his vineyard he shall pay” </span>(Exodus 22:4), which indicates that from his <span class="gemarra-regular">best</span>-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he shall pay, but from <span class="gemarra-regular">something else, no, </span>he shall not pay.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay; <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall recompense </span>money to its owners” (Exodus 21:33–34)? Since the verse states: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” the additional term “he shall recompense” is superfluous. It therefore serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>any item <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money, and even bran, </span>a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of restitution.
Rava resolves the contradiction: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the term “he shall recompense” is referring to a case where he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his own volition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without being taken to court, and he may therefore use any form of payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the phrase “of the best of his field” is referring to a case where he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will, </span>after the injured party has sued him in court. Since he caused the injured party additional trouble, he must pay using his best-quality land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said: </span>According to this explanation, the language of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “He shall pay,” </span>a term that, as opposed to: “He shall recompense,” connotes that he is forced to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him </span>that the precise meaning of the verse does not indicate that he is paying against his will: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: He shall be paid, </span>in the passive form, which would clearly indicate that he did not voluntarily initiate the payment himself but rather is paying against his will? No; <span class="gemarra-regular">“he shall pay” is written, </span>which can also <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate </span>that he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">of his own </span><span class="gemarra-regular">volition.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Abaye said </span>an alternative resolution, <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to that </span>with which the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>i.e., Abaye’s teacher, Rabba, employed in order to resolve a different difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A wealthy person is not entitled to take a poor man’s tithe. He is instead expected to sell his assets and purchase food with the proceeds. But in the case of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who owns</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> houses, fields, and vineyards, but </span>at the present time <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> find </span>buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>whom he can <span class="gemarra-regular">sell them, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may feed him </span>with food from the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor man’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up until hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> the value of his assets.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Master <span class="gemarra-regular">discussed it </span>and asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>that led to him being unable to sell his land? <span class="gemarra-regular">If everyone’s land depreciated </span>in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">also depreciated along with theirs, let us provide him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">even more </span>than half the value of his assets, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone’s land also depreciated, </span>the market value of his property is low and he is genuinely classified as a poor person, who may take as much poor man’s tithe as is given to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone </span>else’s <span class="gemarra-regular">land appreciated </span>in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his land, since </span>people see <span class="gemarra-regular">that he goes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in and goes out for money, </span>i.e., he is in need of money, they reason that he will be forced to accept a lower offer for his property. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">his land depreciated </span>in value. 

Daf 7b

The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">we should not provide him with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even a slight </span>amount of poor man’s tithe. Since his assets, based on their market value, have a high value, he is not to be classified as a poor person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">said concerning this: No, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that he is provided with only up to half the value of his assets is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case where he cannot sell due to seasonal fluctuations in price. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because in the days </span>of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nisan, </span>which is the beginning of the harvest season, the market value of <span class="gemarra-regular">land appreciates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in the days</span> of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">of Tishrei, </span>a time when the harvest had already been reaped and it is too late to prepare the land for the coming year, the market value of <span class="gemarra-regular">land depreciates.</span>
Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">waits until Nisan and sells </span>only at that point. <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need of money, sells </span>his land in Tishrei <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the current, </span>lower, market price. Accordingly, based on the current market prices, his assets have a low value and there is justification in regarding him as a poor person. Yet, since if he waited until Nisan, as everyone else does, his land would have a high value, he cannot truly be classified as a poor person. Therefore, he is permitted to take only as much poor man’s tithe as will cover his losses. The Gemara explains why he is permitted to take only up to half the value of his land: Since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the nature of </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">to depreciate up to half </span>its value, and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not its nature to depreciate more </span>than that, he is entitled to take poor man’s tithe that is worth up to half the value of his land and the rest he can supplement by selling his land at its current, lower price.
Abaye uses a similar distinction to resolve the contradiction he raises: <span class="gemarra-regular">And here also, with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to damages, </span>if one considers a case where the injured party comes to collect his damages during Tishrei, <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> legal right </span>is to collect payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from superior-quality </span>land. This will be a relatively large amount of land, owing to the current seasonal depreciation in its value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the one liable for the damage: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me slightly more land of intermediate quality </span>instead, then the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: If you </span>choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>superior-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is your legal right, take </span>a large amount <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the current </span>market value; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, </span>and you wish to take intermediate-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">take according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">future </span>value in Nisan, after it will have <span class="gemarra-regular">appreciated, </span>which will mean you will be entitled to a smaller amount of land. This can be used to resolve the contradiction: The phrase “of the best of his field,” which indicates that payment is made only from superior-quality land, defines the injured party’s basic rights. The term “he shall recompense,” which indicates that payment may be made in any form, is referring to a case where the injured party forgoes his rights. In such a case the value of the land or item he agrees to receive is appraised based on its appreciated value at the season when it is generally sold.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov objects to this </span>suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, you have weakened </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the power of injured </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to intermediate-quality</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and inferior-quality </span>land, as, by agreeing to receive land of a lower quality than that to which their rights entitle them, they will actually receive less land, since the land is then appraised based on the appreciated market values in Nisan. Such an opinion is untenable, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One states </span>that injured parties collect <span class="gemarra-regular">from the best</span>-quality land, clearly intending to enhance their rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot also </span>collect <span class="gemarra-regular">from intermediate-quality and inferior</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality </span>land unless he agrees that the land should be appraised based on the appreciated Nisan values, thereby lowering the value of his payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: If there is </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">to compare to </span>Rabba’s distinction, it is not compared to a case of payment of damages, but <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can compare it to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>who comes to collect the loan during Tishrei. <span class="gemarra-regular">His legal right</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me slightly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more land of inferior quality </span>instead, the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">can say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: If you </span>choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the intermediate-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as is your legal right, take </span>a large amount <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the current </span>market value, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, </span>and you wish to take land of inferior quality, <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the future, appreciated, </span>market value in the month of Nisan. This would mean that the creditor would be entitled to a smaller amount of land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, objects to this </span>suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, you have locked the door in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> face of </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as, </span>according to your suggestion, the creditor is in a disadvantageous position. <span class="gemarra-regular">He can say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">Were I </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">to have </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money</span> I lent you, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>a large parcel of land <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the current </span>depreciated market value, so why, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that the money is with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you, should I </span>be forced to <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the future, appreciated </span>market value of the month of Nisan? If people are penalized as a result of granting loans, they will cease to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ika, said: If there is </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">to compare to </span>Rabba’s distinction, <span class="gemarra-regular">we can compare it to </span>the collection of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract </span>where she comes to collect it during Tishrei. <span class="gemarra-regular">As a woman’s legal right</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract </span>is to collect payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>her husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if she says to </span>her former husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me slightly less land of intermediate quality</span> instead, her former husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to her: If you</span> choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the lowest-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as is your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> legal right, take </span>a large amount <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> current </span>market value, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, </span>and you wish to take land of a higher quality, <span class="gemarra-regular">take in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the future appreciated </span>market value of the month of Nisan, which will mean you will be entitled only to a smaller amount of land.
The Gemara returns to examine the contradiction raised by Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, </span>the original <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty</span> still remains.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Whatever he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gives </span>the injured party as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">he must give him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the best </span>of that type. For example, even if he pays in bran he must pay with his best-quality bran, and this is the meaning of the phrase “of the best of his field.” Accordingly, the contra-diction is resolved. The term “he shall recompense” indicates that payment can be given in any form, but the phrase “of the best of his field” indicates only that whichever form of payment is used, it must be of a superior quality, and not, as Abaye initially understood it, as limiting the form of payment specifically to land of superior quality.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t “the best</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his field” written, </span>which suggests that the requirement to pay with one’s best land applies only when one pays with land?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, when Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s academy, they explained it </span>as follows: With regard to payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">all items are </span>classified as property of the <span class="gemarra-regular">best </span>quality, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be sold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, it can be sold in another city. </span>Since movable items are easily liquidated, they are always considered an acceptable form of payment. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">with the exception of land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is not always easily sold. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">must give </span>the injured party payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from his best</span>-quality land, which is easier to sell. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>to ensure the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that a buyer will jump at </span>the opportunity to purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>thereby providing the injured party with the possibility of liquidating it. This resolves the contradiction. The phrase “of the best of his field” indicates that if payment is made with land it must be with superior-quality land, and the term “he shall recompense” indicates that if payment is made from movable property, anything worth money may be used.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Abba from Akronya asked Rabbi Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: When </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>land to determine if it is to be classified as being of superior-quality, does <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appraise </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of a property owner’s other land <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">it appraise </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">based </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the quality of the land in <span class="gemarra-regular">the worl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> at large?
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not raise the dilemma in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, as he says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we appraise </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of land owned by the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party, and therefore payment is made with land that is of a similar quality to the best-quality land of the injured party. Accordingly, it is obvious that the classification is based only on the land of the injured party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When you raise this dilemma,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we appraise </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of land owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and he pays with his superior-quality land even if its quality exceeds that of any of the injured party’s land. Consequently, according to Rabbi Akiva it is appropriate to ask whether the appraisal is based only on his other land or based on the land in the world at large.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the answer to the dilemma? When <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One states: “The best of his field” </span>(Exodus 22:4), does the stress in the verse on “his field” serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>only the possibility of appraising land based solely on the value of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party, but land is appraised based on the quality of land in the world at large? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>does it serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the possibility of appraising land based on the quality of land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world </span>at large <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>and it is sufficient if the land he pays with is his best-quality land?
Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The Merciful One states: “The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> best of his field,” and you say </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises</span> land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of land in <span class="gemarra-regular">the world</span> at large? Certainly the term “his field” teaches that it is sufficient that the land be the best of the land of the one liable for the damage.
Rav Shmuel bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>this opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that delineates the forms of payment used for paying damages, repaying a debt to a creditor, and paying a marriage contract: If the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only superior-quality </span>land,<span class="gemarra-regular"> all of them collect from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the superior-quality </span>land. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only intermediate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality</span> land. And if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he has superior-quality, intermediate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality, and inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a creditor </span>collects <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a woman’s marriage contract </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land. If he has only <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality and intermediate-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land, and payment to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land. If he has only <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality and inferior-quality </span>land, payments for <span class="gemarra-regular">damages and </span>payments owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality</span> land, while payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land. 

Daf 8a

If he has only <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality and inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>pay-ments owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor and </span>payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contract </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land.
The Gemara explains how this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> poses a challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause: </span>If he owns only <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality </span>land, payments for <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>payments owed to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract </span>are made <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land. This clause demonstrates that the quality of land is appraised objectively based on the standard of the world at large. The reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of the land of the one liable for the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">let his intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">be classified as superior-quality </span>land, as that is the best land he owns, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consequently, the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be directed to </span>collect the debt from the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality</span> land.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>at the time the borrower took the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">had superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it. </span>Accordingly, no matter how land is appraised, at the time that the loan was given his intermediate-quality land would be classified as being of intermediate quality. Consequently, the creditor’s lien on the borrower’s land, which took effect from the moment the loan was given, takes effect with regard to the intermediate-quality land. Therefore, the creditor retains his right to collect from that land, regardless of the fact that by the time of collec-tion it was the borrower’s best land and at that point could be reclassified as land of superior quality.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And so says Rav Ḥisda: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> deals with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>at the time he took the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">had superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This too stands to reason, from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If a debtor has only <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>are collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land, while payments to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor and</span> payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract </span>are made from the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land. These two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are difficult, </span>as they contradict <span class="gemarra-regular">each other. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above teaches that in this case the creditor collects the debt from the intermediate-quality land, whereas this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that he collects the debt from the inferior-quality land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above, it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">had superior-quality </span>land at the time that he took the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it,</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> subsequently cited, it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not have superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he did not <span class="gemarra-regular">sell it. </span>In such a case, since his intermediate-quality land was his best land, it is classified as superior-quality land and accordingly, no lien took effect with regard to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> can be resolved differently: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> concern cases where the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">and sell it.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">is equivalent </span>in quality <span class="gemarra-regular">to the superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world </span>at large; therefore, it is classified as superior-quality land and the creditor has no right to collect from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">is not equivalent </span>in quality <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world at large </span>but is similar to the intermediate-quality land of the world at large; consequently, the creditor has a claim to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> concern a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land, which is the best land he owns, <span class="gemarra-regular">is equivalent </span>in quality <span class="gemarra-regular">to the intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world </span>at large, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about this: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the debtor’s land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>other land, so that his best land is classified as superior-quality land and the creditor has no claim on it. And the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the debtor’s land <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the quality of land in <span class="gemarra-regular">the world </span>at large, so that his land is classified as intermediate-quality land and the creditor is entitled to claim it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>Another resolution to the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> is that the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla, as Ulla says: By Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> law, a creditor </span>collects <span class="gemarra-regular">from inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man you have a claim against will bring his collateral</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out to you” </span>(Deuteronomy 24:11). One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>item would <span class="gemarra-regular">a person typically </span>choose <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring out </span>for use as collateral and potential payment? Certainly it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">most inferior of his utensils. </span>The verse thereby indicates that a creditor collects from inferior-quality land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, for <span class="gemarra-regular">what reason </span>did the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>collects <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality </span>land? They instituted this ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as not to lock the door in the face of</span> potential <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowers, </span>as, if creditors were limited to collecting from inferior-quality land they would be hesitant to offer loans in the first place.
Ravina explains: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance </span>cited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Ulla </span>that a creditor collects from intermediate-quality land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance </span>cited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Ulla, </span>so the creditor has a right to collect from only inferior-quality land, in accordance with Torah law.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 12:3): If one owes money to pay damages, repay a loan, and pay a woman’s marriage contract, and he owns inferior-quality, intermediate-quality, and superior-quality land, and he sells all of his land, then if he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>all of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">or to three people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>the buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">replace the </span>land’s prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>with regard to repayment of his debts. At the time when each debt was created, each creditor gained a lien on the plots of the debtor’s land, from which they have a right to collect. As a lien remains in effect even if the land is sold, then even after the sale, each creditor can collect from the plots of land upon which they have a lien. Accordingly, damages are collected from the superior-quality land, the loan is repaid from the intermediate-quality land, and the marriage contract is paid from the inferior-quality land.
If he sold his plots of land <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>the creditors <span class="gemarra-regular">collect from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> last </span>buyer, regardless of the quality of the land he purchased. If that buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>sufficient land purchased from the debtor to pay all the debts, the creditors take the land he has and <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the remaining sums <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>purchased land <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, </span>and if he also <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>sufficient land, they <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the rest <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, </span>i.e., the first buyer. The Sages instituted that creditors may not collect from land that a debtor sold, even though it is technically still liened to them, as long as the debtor still has sufficient means with which to repay the debt (see <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 48b). Accordingly, after the sale of the first plot of land, the creditors’ rights to collect are restricted to the land that remains in the possession of the debtor, and consequently they gain a lien on it, irrespective of its quality. Therefore, even if that land is subsequently sold, their rights to collect are restricted to that land, and only if the value of that land is insufficient to cover the cost of the debt may they utilize the original liens they had on the plots of land that were sold first.
The Gemara clarifies: With regard to the first case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where he <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>all the land <span class="gemarra-regular">to one</span> person, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circum-stances?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously</span> sold all of the land to one person, that is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that if he sold the land <span class="gemarra-regular">to three </span>different people simultaneously, <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possible to say </span>that the sale to <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> preceded </span>the other sales, yet <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">replace the </span>land’s prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span> equally, and the possibility that one might have proceeded the other is disregarded, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same in a case where all the plots of land were simultaneously <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to one </span>person?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the plots of land were sold <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But what is different </span>about the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where the plots of land were sold to <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>buyers, one after the other, and the creditors collect only from the last buyer? It is different in <span class="gemarra-regular">that each one </span>of the first two buyers <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>any creditor who tries to seize the land they purchased: Do not collect my land, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place for you, </span>a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">from which to collect. </span>In other words, when the first two buyers purchased their land a plot of land remained with the debtor, and therefore the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to that land.
The Gemara continues its question: In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>where all the plots of land were sold to a single buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to each one </span>of the first two plots of land that were sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>any creditor who tries to collect: With my purchase of the first two plots of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">I left a place for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you, </span>a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">from which to collect. </span>Therefore, even though the debtor subsequently sold the buyer all of the land, the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to the last plot of land the debtor sold the buyer, irrespective of its quality. Why then does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rule that in this case each creditor collects from the land that was originally liened to him?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the individual buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">last</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Accordingly, the buyer is satisfied with allowing each creditor to collect from the land that was previously liened to him, rather than having them each collect from the superior-quality land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so says Rav Sheshet: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the individual buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">last.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, let them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all come and collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land, as their rights to collect should be restricted to it, since it was purchased last.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he can say </span>the following threat <span class="gemarra-regular">to them: If you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are silent </span>and do not insist on collecting from the superior-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>the land of a quality that is due to you <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">legal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights, </span>as in a case where you collect directly from the debtor, i.e., the injured party will collect from the superior-quality land, the creditor from the intermediate-quality land, and the woman will collect her marriage contract from the inferior-quality land, then <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>that land and I will allow you to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, </span>and you insist on taking the superior-quality land that I purchased last, then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will return the bil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inferior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">to its </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, </span>i.e., the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you will all </span>be forced to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land, because whenever the debtor has land in his possession you are able to collect the debts only from him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that this is the reason for the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, 

Daf 8b

then <span class="gemarra-regular">also with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to damages, let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">say this </span>to the injured party. He could threaten to return the bill of sale of the inferior-quality land to the debtor, which would force the injured party to collect directly from the debtor’s inferior-quality land. Since the buyer can do so, he can effectively force the injured party to collect from the purchased intermediate-quality land instead of fulfilling his right to collect from superior-quality land. Yet, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that in this case each party collects from the land that was originally liened to him, which means that damages are collected from the superior-quality land, indicating that this threat would not be effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case in which the debtor died and his inheritors are his <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans, who are not subject to </span>an obligation to <span class="gemarra-regular">repa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the debts of their father. When one dies, his monetary debts are not inherited by his children. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the lien of </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">rests </span>solely <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer </span>of the land. Any lien that was in effect with regard to the land he owned at the time he incurred the obligation remains, and his creditors can therefore collect what they are owed from that land, even if it is in the possession of a buyer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, one cannot say </span>that the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is based on the fact that the buyer can threaten to return the bill of sale to the debtor, or in this case, to his orphans. In this case, even if he were to return the bill of sale, the creditors would not be able to collect from the land now in the orphans’ possession, as they received it anew, not as an inheritance from their father. Therefore, the creditors can still collect from the plots of land that remain with the buyer.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>not all the creditors collect from the superior-quality land, which was the last plot of land purchased from the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to them: What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages said one is not paid from liened </span>property, i.e., property liened to a creditor that has been sold by the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">whenever there is unsold </span>property still in the debtor’s possession? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ordinance </span>created solely <span class="gemarra-regular">for my </span>benefit, as I should not be expected to pay from the land I purchased when the debtor is still able to pay. If that ordinance were to be in effect in this case, all of their liens would be in effect with regard to the superior-quality land, as that was purchased last. In this case <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not </span>find <span class="gemarra-regular">this ordinance satisfactory to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and I would prefer for the lien of each creditor to remain in effect with regard to the land it had been on initially, and I will give each of you that land.
The Gemara notes: This fact that one is not required to avail himself of the financial benefit provided by a rabbinic ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava. As Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Anyone who says: I do not want </span>to avail myself <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the financial benefit provided by <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinance of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages, such as this </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">one listens to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> does Rava mean by saying: An ordinance of the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this </span>one?
The Gemara answers: His statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says:</span> The Sages enacted that a husband must sustain his wife. They also enacted that he receives her earnings in exchange. Yet, <span class="gemarra-regular">a wife is </span>legally <span class="gemarra-regular">entitled to say to her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> husband: I will not be sustained </span>by you, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in turn <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not wor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> i.e., you will not keep my earnings. Since his obligation to sustain her is only for her benefit, she may forgo her sustenance and retain her earnings for herself.
The Gemara discusses a limitation on the buyer’s ability to refuse the benefit of the rabbinic ordinance: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is obvious </span>that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer sold, </span>of the land he purchased from the debtor, the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate- and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inferior-quality </span>land to another buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">and retained in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his possession </span>only the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land, which he had purchased last, <span class="gemarra-regular">then all </span>the creditors <span class="gemarra-regular">may come and collect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is the last </span>land he purchased and consequently was the last plot of land in the debtor’s possession. Accordingly, by virtue of the rabbinic ordinance, the creditors’ right of collection is restricted to that land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">are no longer </span>in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span>if the intermediate-quality and inferior-quality land are in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is able say to </span>those owed money, i.e., a creditor and a woman collecting her marriage contact: <span class="gemarra-regular">Collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior-quality </span>land, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not satisfactory to me </span>to avail myself <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the financial benefit provided by <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinance of the Sages. </span>In this case, the ordinance also benefits the second buyer, since it provides that as long as the first buyer retains some of the liened land, the creditors’ right of collection is only from that land. Since the second buyer also benefits from the ordinance, the first buyer cannot refuse the benefit of the rabbinic ordinance, because doing so would be at the expense of the second buyer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the first buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>only the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-quality </span>land that he had purchased last, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">retained</span> in his possession the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye thought to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: All </span>the creditors <span class="gemarra-regular">should come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land. Since that land was the last plot of land in the debtor’s possession, the creditors’ right of collection was restricted to that land, irrespective of the fact that it was then subsequently sold twice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: What has the first </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to the second </span>in any sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">Any rights that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will come into his possession. And since, if </span>the creditors <span class="gemarra-regular">were to come to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first buyer </span>while he was still in possession of all three plots of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> could have had them collect from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inferior-quality </span>land; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when he </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</span> land the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">unsold </span>property in the debtor’s possession. As although there is the rabbinic ordinance that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not exact payment from liened property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when there is unsold </span>property still in the debtor’s possession, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">could have said to them: I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>find <span class="gemarra-regular">this ordinance satisfactory to me.</span>
Rava continues: Therefore, since the first buyer had the right to say this, the <span class="gemarra-regular">second buyer can also say to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: Collect </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality and inferior-quality </span>land in the first buyer’s possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, when the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second buyer purchased </span>the superior-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he purchased </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with the understanding that he </span>also acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">all the rights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the first </span>buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">had with regard to </span>that land. Accordingly, he also acquires the right to insist that the creditors collect from the intermediate-quality and inferior-quality land.
In a related ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven, who sold all of his fields to Shimo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> simultaneously <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shimon proceeded to sell one field </span>of those purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">to Levi, and Reuven’s creditor came </span>to collect the debt, if the creditor so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires, he collects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>one, i.e., Shimon, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires, he collects from that </span>one, i.e., Levi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we said this only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intermediate-quality </span>land from Shimon. A creditor’s right is to collect the debt from intermediate-quality land. Accordingly, in this case, Reuven’s creditor can collect his loan from the intermediate-quality land even after it has been transferred into Levi’s possession. Nevertheless, if he so desires, he may insist on collecting his loan from any inferior-quality land left in Shimon’s possession. This is because a creditor also has the right to demand payment from a borrower’s inferior-quality land instead of his intermediate-quality land, and therefore that land is also liened to the loan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased superior-quality and inferior-quality </span>land from Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the creditor can collect only from Shimon’s intermediate-quality land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Levi could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: For this </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I was particular to purchase superior-quality</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and inferior-quality </span>land, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">land that is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for you </span>to collect from as a creditor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span> Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate-quality </span>land from Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we said </span>that Reuven’s creditor can collect from him <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not leave </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">similar intermediate-quality </span>land in Shimon’s possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> in that case, Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">is unable to say to </span>the creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">I left a place for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a plot of land, <span class="gemarra-regular">in Shimon’s possession, </span>from which to collect. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>where Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">did leave </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">similar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intermediate-quality </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">in Shimon’s possession, </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not collect from </span>Levi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: I left a place for you from which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to collect.</span>
In another related ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven, who sold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a field </span>liened to his creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shimon with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>meaning that Reuven agreed to reimburse Shimon should Reuven’s creditor collect the debt from that field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Reuven’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s creditor came and seized </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">from Shimon, the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is that Reuven </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">go and litigate with </span>his creditor and claim that he had already repaid the debt, and insist that the field be returned to Shimon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is unable to say to </span>Reuven: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not legally answerable to you, </span>as I am not taking away your land, since you sold it to Shimon. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>Reuven could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: If you extract</span> the field <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">will return to me </span>and demand that I reimburse him for his loss. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: Even </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he sold the field <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarantee, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case even if the creditor seizes Shimon’s land there are no legal consequences for Reuven, Reuven can litigate with the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: It is not satisfactory for me for Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to have a grievance against me </span>because he lost the field I sold him on account of the fact that I was unable to pay my debt. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in another related ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who sold a field to Shimon without a guarantee, </span>

Daf 9a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and claimants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come forth about </span>the ownership of the land, disputing Reuven’s prior ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as </span>Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">has not yet taken possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can retract </span>his agreement to the transaction and is not required to pay for the land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taken possession </span>of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot retract </span>his agreement to the transaction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he cannot retract his agreement to the transaction once he has taken possession? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>Reuven <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: </span>The purchase of the land was like purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">a tied bag [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> whose contents are unknown and might not have any value. Since <span class="gemarra-regular">you were aware </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">and accepte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that possibility, as you purchased it without a guarantee, you cannot retract your agreement.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From when is it </span>considered that he has <span class="gemarra-regular">taken possession </span>of the property? He takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">that he walks upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boundarie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the land to inspect it.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to a case where the field was sold <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantee. But </span>where it was sold <span class="gemarra-regular">with a guarantee </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so, and Shimon can retract his agreement and refuse to pay for the land even after taking possession of it. The reason is that if the claimants succeed with their claims and seize the land, Reuven will then have to return the sum Shimon paid for it. In order to minimize judicial proceedings, the court allows Shimon to claim that there is no point in paying Reuven now only to have his money returned to him later. Therefore, he can retract his agreement to the transaction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>where the field was sold <span class="gemarra-regular">with a guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Shimon is unable to retract his agreement to the transaction, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Reuven has the legal right to <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">show me the claim authorization document, </span>which a court provides to a buyer when the land he purchased is seized from him by a third party who proved that he had a lien on the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only then <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will pay you. </span>Consequently, Shimon cannot claim that there is no point in paying Reuven now, after he agreed to the sale but before a third party seized the land, as even if the land will be seized it does not automatically follow that Reuven will have to reimburse Shimon.
§ The Gemara returns to its earlier discussion concerning the form of the payment of damages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>Damages are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">money or </span>with one’s best-quality land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman raised an objection</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rav Huna </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">He shall recompense </span>money to its owner” (Exodus 21:34), which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money, even bran, </span>a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of payment.
Rav Huna replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not have </span>any money or land. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he does not have</span> any other means with which to pay, isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he can pay using what he has? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Go </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">trouble </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>whatever commodity you own, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">bring him money </span>as payment for the damage, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that it is unnecessary to sell one’s possessions and pay with money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: Money is equivalent to land. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> are they equivalent? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>fulfilling the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, meaning that he can choose to pay with money instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>precisely the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna; </span>and yet the ruling of Rav Asi is presented as an independent ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Asi is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers who divided </span>their inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took land and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>took <span class="gemarra-regular">money, and </span>subsequently their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor came and took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>as it was liened to his loan. Rav Asi’s ruling teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>brother whose land was taken can <span class="gemarra-regular">go and take a half </span>share <span class="gemarra-regular">of the money together </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his brother.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">a son and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">not a son? </span>Since they are both sons and equally inherited the estate of their father, they share responsibility for their father’s debts. If the creditor takes repayment of the debt from one brother, the other one must reimburse him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the Gemara rejects this explanation not because it is obvious, but <span class="gemarra-regular">on the contrary, </span>because it is incorrect. As, one could one could look at it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the opposite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">direction, </span>saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one brother <span class="gemarra-regular">could say to </span>the other: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>understanding that <span class="gemarra-regular">I took the money,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that if it would be stolen </span>from me <span class="gemarra-regular">I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not be reimbursed from your </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>understanding that <span class="gemarra-regular">you took the land, that if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it would be seized </span>from you by a creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not be reimbursed from my </span>money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Asi is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two brothers who divided </span>the land they inherited from their father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of one of them. </span>Since the brothers carry joint responsibility for their father’s debt, the one whose portion was seized has a right to be reimbursed by his brother. Rav Asi’s ruling teaches that this may be done either by redistributing the remaining portion of land or by reimbursing him with money.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Asi </span>already explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before? </span>Therefore, this cannot be the explanation of this ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who divided </span>the land they inherited from their father, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor came and took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav says </span>that the initial <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the land is <span class="gemarra-regular">voided </span>and any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says </span>that each brother, upon taking his portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">viter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Asi says </span>that the brother whose portion was seized has a right to receive half of the remaining inheritance: <span class="gemarra-regular">He takes a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter in land, and </span>he takes the other <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money.</span>
The Gemara explains the rationale behind each opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that the initial <span class="gemarra-regular">division </span>of the land is <span class="gemarra-regular">voided. </span>This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divided </span>their inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered to still be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with respect to the inheritance, and therefore they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Consequently, any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that each brother, upon taking his portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">relinquished </span>any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divided </span>their inheritance are considered to be like <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of their respective portions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>each one is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a buyer </span>who bought his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">without a guarante</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that would have provided him with a right to be reimbursed if his portion were seized by a creditor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Asi says </span>that the brother whose portion was seized has the right to receive half the remaining inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">He takes a quarter in land and </span>he takes the other <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter in money. </span>This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>as to <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they are similar to heirs, </span>in which case the remaining land should be redistributed between them, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they are similar to buyers </span>who bought their portions with a guarantee, in which case the brother whose portion was taken should be reimbursed by his brother with a sum of money equal to the value of the land that was seized from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, he takes a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> quarter in land and </span>he takes the other <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money.</span>
As Rav Asi had already stated the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of brothers who divided their inheritance, the Gemara suggests another explanation of his statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>did Rav Asi state that money <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to land? </span>He stated it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, and is teaching that one may choose to pay with money instead of land.
The Gemara repeats its original rejection of this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>precisely the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, </span>and yet Rav Asi is presented as an independent ruling. The Gemara resolves the problem: Emend the statement and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: And similarly, Rav Asi said.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna says: For </span>the purchase of an object with which to fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva, </span>one should spend <span class="gemarra-regular">up to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one-third.</span>
The Gemara asks: To <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>does this <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third </span>refer? 

Daf 9b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it means that one should spend up to <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">estat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to perform a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if that is so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if it happened to him </span>that he became obligated in <span class="gemarra-regular">three mitzvot </span>at the same time, <span class="gemarra-regular">should he give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his entire estate </span>away in order to fulfill those mitzvot? One is certainly not required to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">embellishment</span> of the performance <span class="gemarra-regular">of a mitzva, </span>e.g., to purchase a more beautiful item used in the performance of a mitzva, one should spend <span class="gemarra-regular">up to one-third </span>more than the cost <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the standard item used to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma: </span>How is this one-third calculated? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third from within, </span>i.e., he calculates the cost of a standard item, adds one-third of that value, and spends the total on purchasing a more beautiful item; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third from without, </span>i.e., one-third of the sum he ultimately spends should be the additional sum added in order to purchase a more beautiful item? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira: </span>Of the money one spends on purchasing a more beautiful item to perform a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">up to one-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>more than the cost of a standard item comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from his ow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> finances, but <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>any additional sum spent on purchasing a more beautiful item comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the largesse of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He, </span>i.e., God will reimburse him for spending that additional sum.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which I became responsible for safeguarding it </span>to prevent it from causing damage, if it in fact causes damage, it is considered as if <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>actively <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitated that damage, </span>and accordingly I must pay for it. In any case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">I facilitated part of the damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">I am liable for payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>if I were the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who facilitated the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire damage it </span>caused.
One is liable only with regard to damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>were he to use it for a non-sacred purpose, he <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be</span> liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property; with regard to damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">property that belongs to members of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the covenant, </span>i.e., Jews; and with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">assigned property, </span>the meaning of which the Gemara will explain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one is liable for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in any place except for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain designated </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one responsible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one is liable for damage caused in <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage, the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the damage </span>caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to pay payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage with </span>his best-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">land.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that elucidates the mishna’s ruling: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">became responsible for safeguarding it </span>to prevent it from causing damage, if it in fact causes damage, it is considered as if <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>actively <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitated that damage </span>and accordingly must pay for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox or a pit that one transferred to </span>the care of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deaf-mute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, or a minor, </span>whose presumed limited intellectual capacity means they are deemed incapable of sufficiently safeguarding them from causing damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ox or pit <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that since the owner of the ox or pit did not fulfill his duty to safeguard them, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>for the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not so in </span>a corresponding case where the damage is caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara elucidates: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If we say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> deals with <span class="gemarra-regular">a tethered ox or a covered pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which cannot cause damage in the manner in which the owner left them, then the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">of fire, </span>where he is not liable, is where one transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">an ember </span>to one of limited halakhic competence, which, had it been left alone, would not have erupted into a fire and caused damage. This cannot be correct, because if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different here </span>in the case of an ox and a pit, where one is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different there </span>in the case of the fire, that exempts him from liability? There seems to be no reason to differentiate between them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">an untethered ox or an exposed pit, </span>which can cause damage in the manner in which the owner left them. If so, then the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire, </span>where he is not liable, is where one transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame </span>to one of limited halakhic competence, which can also cause damage in this form. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: But if so, why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> state: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which is not so </span>in the case of damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a fire, as one is exempt </span>from paying damages? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is untenable, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish say in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught </span>that one is exempt from damage caused by a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred an ember to </span>one of limited halakhic competence <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned </span>it into a flame. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame </span>to him, the one who transferred the flame to him <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>for any damage caused. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>He is responsible <span class="gemarra-regular">because the </span>capacity for it to cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara returns to its initial suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a tethered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox or a covered pit, and </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">of fire, </span>where he is not liable, is where one transferred <span class="gemarra-regular">an ember </span>to one of limited halakhic competence. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>in order to reject this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different here </span>in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different there </span>in the case of the fire, that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item was not able to cause damage in its current form, so he is exempt from liability.
The Gemara explains: You could answer as follows: The typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of an ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is to free </span>itself  from being tethered and the typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a pit is </span>for its cover <span class="gemarra-regular">to become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dislodged. </span>Therefore, as it is negligent to transfer an ox or pit to someone who is incapable of sufficiently safeguarding them, the one who transferred the ox or flame to them is liable. By contrast, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ember, as long as he leaves it </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">it progressively </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dims, </span>and the only way in which it will cause damage is if someone else actively fans it into a flame; therefore, he is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says: Even </span>if the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one transferred a flame to </span>one of limited halakhic competence he <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt, </span>it is possible to say that the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>in the first clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to an untethered ox or an exposed pit. </span>The Gemara asks: But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different here </span>in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different there </span>in the case of the fire that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item that was transferred is capable of causing damage in its current form, so he would be expected to be liable.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of fire, ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">the deaf-mute’s handling [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzevata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">causes </span>the damage, as if it were not for him moving the flame no damage would have been caused. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the ox and the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">the deaf-mute’s handling </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">does not cause</span> the damage. Rather, the damage was caused even though they remained in exactly the same dangerous state in which the one who had transferred them to the deaf-mute did so. Therefore, the damage is a result of that person’s negligence, and he is liable.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">O</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as opposed to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>and conversely, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to Pit as opposed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ox.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> elucidates: The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to Ox as opposed to Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox </span>kills a Jew, the owner is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a ransom </span>to the victim’s heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela </span>to the slave’s master.

Daf 10a

There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to</span> the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox as op-posed to Fire, </span>and conversely, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to Fire as opposed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Ox.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> elucidates: The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox as opposed to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>kills a Jew the owner is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a ransom, and for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>. Furthermore, in such a case, once the court hears the evidence and the <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict of </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is complete </span>and the court rules that the ox must be killed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from the ox. And if <span class="gemarra-regular">one transfers</span> his ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the care of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf-mute, an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imbecile, or a minor, </span>and it causes damage, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>All of <span class="gemarra-regular">this is not so with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fire. </span>And the <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to Fire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as opposed to Ox is that </span>the one responsible for <span class="gemarra-regular">the fire is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from its inception, which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not so with regard to an ox.</span>
There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opposed to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>and conversely, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that applies to Pit as opposed to Fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> elucidates: The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit as opposed to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that its initial formation, </span>e.g., its digging, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>done in a manner that can <span class="gemarra-regular">result in damage, </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">one transfers it to </span>the care of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor </span>and it causes damage, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. This is not so with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a fire. </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to Fire as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opposed to Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed and cause damage. And </span>the one responsible for <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">consuming both something that is fitting for it and something </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is not fitting for it, </span>i.e., both flammable and non-flammable items. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not so with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a pit.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the following additional stringency: <span class="gemarra-regular">A stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that applies to Ox as opposed to Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox </span>damages vessels, the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the vessels, which is not so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to a pit, </span>which incurs liability for its owner only for damage it causes to people and to animals but not to vessels.
The Gemara explains: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">pit.</span>
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>try to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>and explain accordingly <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>which states: The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed and cause damage. And </span>the one responsible for <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">consuming both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">something that is fitting for it and something that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not fitting for it. This is not so with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a pit. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Something that is fitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it, what are these? </span>Pieces of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood. Something </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is not fitting for it, what are these? Vessels. </span>And yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not so with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a pit, </span>which indicates that liability is not incurred for damage done to vessels by one’s pit. The Gemara presents the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for damage</span> caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels by </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">pit?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>the additional stringency mentioned is true but was not mentioned because the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>certain cases <span class="gemarra-regular">and omitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> others. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">did he omit </span>that makes it reasonable to assume <span class="gemarra-regular">that he omitted this? </span>As a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> would never omit just a single case, perforce there must be more. The Gemara explains: He also <span class="gemarra-regular">omitted </span>the case of damage done to <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>item. Liability is incurred for damage done to a concealed item only when it was caused through a category of damage other than fire. If it is damaged by a fire that one lit, he is exempt.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and </span>explain that the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Something that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not fitting for it, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span> serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to include vessels; </span>with regard to vessels there is no distinction between Fire and Pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case where a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">scorched </span>another person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed field or singed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sikhsekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his stones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are ways of causing damage that cannot be caused by a pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi objects to this </span>suggestion: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the following additional stringency: <span class="gemarra-regular">A stringency that applies to Ox as opposed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that in the </span>primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ox one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>if his ox damages another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>that is in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified consecrated </span>animals, i.e., an animal set aside to be an offering that was disqualified from use and then redeemed. He is liable despite the fact that even after being redeemed it retains a degree of sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not so with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to a disqualified consecrated animal, as in that case he is not liable for the damage caused.
Rav Ashi explains his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">omitted that </span>case of damage done to vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also omitted this </span>case of damage done to disqualified consecrated animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, what </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">did he omit </span>that makes it reasonable to assume <span class="gemarra-regular">that he omitted this?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He omitted </span>the case of an ox that intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">trampled on a plowed field of </span>another person in order to cause damage. Since the damage was intentional it is included in the primary category of Goring and so one is liable. This manner of causing damage cannot be done by a pit. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one claims that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> omitted the case of damage done to disqualified consecrated animals only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that he also omitted the case of an ox that intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">trampled on a plowed field of </span>another person, that is not a sufficient justification. The latter case <span class="gemarra-regular">is not an </span>additional independent <span class="gemarra-regular">omission, as it is </span>included in that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to proceed and cause damage. </span>The fact that there is no case in the category of Pit corresponding to an ox that intentionally trampled on a plowed field is addressed by this clause.
§ The mishna states: In any case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">I facilitated part of the damage it </span>caused, I am liable for payments of restitution for damage it caused, as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage it caused.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that elucidates the mishna’s ruling: In any case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">I facilitated part of the damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable for payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> if I were the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who facilitated the entire damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>caused. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> digs a pit </span>to a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">and completes </span>the digging <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, the depth at which a pit, according to <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, can cause death, only <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span>individual is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for injuries and death caused by the pit. Although the pit was already able to cause injury before the second individual deepened it, since by deepening it he increased its capacity to cause damage, he becomes liable for any damage it causes.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is not in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who digs a pit </span>to a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">and completes </span>the digging <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, only <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span>individual is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for both injuries and death caused by the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: With regard to death </span>caused by the pit, the responsibility is <span class="gemarra-regular">ascribed to the latter</span> individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to damage </span>caused by the pit, the responsibility is <span class="gemarra-regular">ascribed to the two of them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers only to a digger’s liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for death </span>caused by a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">unanimous, </span>i.e., it is in accordance with the opinions of both the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the preceding discussion took a slightly different form: The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>answered and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers only to a digger’s liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for death </span>caused by a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">unanimous.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira objects to </span>the explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that the mishna is referring only to one specific case: <span class="gemarra-regular">But are there no more </span>cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred his ox to five individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in order for them to safeguard it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one of them was negligent </span>in his duties <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage? </span>Isn’t this individual <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for all the damage? This seems to be an additional example of the principle in the mishna that if one facilitated part of the damage caused, he is liable for pay-ments of restitution for the damage caused, as if he were the one who facilitated the entire damage, so the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects the possibility that the mishna could be referring to this case: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which the negligent watchman bears full liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that without him </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">would not have been </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarded </span>because the ox was particularly strong and it took all five individuals to safeguard it, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that the negligent individual is liable for all the damage. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he alone, through his negligence, <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>all the damage, not just part of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case must be <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">would still have been </span>sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarded. </span>The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he do </span>by not safeguarding it? It was still safeguarded without him, so he should not be liable for even part of the damage. It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet objects to </span>the explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that the mishna is referring only to one specific case: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>also the case of a fire that was left unattended by its owner and someone else <span class="gemarra-regular">augmented </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>adding <span class="gemarra-regular">a bundl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of wood to it, thereby increasing the capacity of the fire to cause damage to another’s field? Even though he only increased the fire’s capacity to damage, he is liable for any damage it causes. Seemingly, this is an additional example of the mishna’s principle that if one facilitated part of the damage caused, he is liable for payments of restitution for the damage caused, as if he were one who facilitated the entire damage, so the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>

Daf 10b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">would not have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spread </span>to another person’s field <span class="gemarra-regular">without him </span>adding bundles the fire, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that he alone is liable for the damage because he alone did everything that led to the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case must be one where the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">would have spread </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without him. </span>The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he do </span>by adding bundles of wood? The fire would have spread without him, so he did not cause even part of the damage. It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to </span>the claim of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the mishna refers only to one specific case: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t there </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were sitting on one bench [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">safsal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it did not break, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>additional person <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sat upon it and broke it </span>with his added weight, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span>individual is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for all the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said </span>by way of clarification that this applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the last individual to sit down was as heavy as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he could have potentially broken it even on his own, he had no right to use it. In this case, even though the weight of the first five individuals was presumably a contributing factor in causing the damage, since the damage was ultimately caused by the additional weight of the last individual, he is liable for all of the damage. Seemingly, this is an additional example of the mishna’s principle, and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without him </span>the bench <span class="gemarra-regular">would never have broken </span>under the weight of the first five people, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious</span> that the last individual is liable for all the damage, as ultimately it was his action alone that caused the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">even without him </span>the bench <span class="gemarra-regular">would have broken </span>under the weight of the first five people, and the last individual sat down just as it was about to break. The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what did he do, </span>i.e., why should he be liable at all? It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, how is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> cited by Rav Pappa to be <span class="gemarra-regular">explained? </span>As the Gemara explained, the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is understandable only if it is referring to a case where the bench would not have broken without him. But if that is the case, as the Gemara noted, it is obvious and therefore unnecessary to state it.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where without him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it would have broken in two hours, and now it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">broke in one hour. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the last individual alone is liable and not the first five, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they can say to </span>the last individual: <span class="gemarra-regular">Were it not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for you, we would have sat a little bit more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">stood up; </span>consequently, the bench would never have broken. Therefore, it was ultimately you who caused the bench to break, and therefore only you are liable.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion, because in that situation the last individual would have a valid counterclaim: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let him say to them: Were it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not for you </span>continuing to sit on the bench after I sat down, the bench would not have broken, as <span class="gemarra-regular">under my </span>weight alone <span class="gemarra-regular">it would not have broken. </span>Accordingly, we should share the liability for damaging it.
The Gemara offers a different suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>instantaneously, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was leaning upon </span>the other five people, <span class="gemarra-regular">the bench broke.</span>
The Gemara asks: If so, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that he alone is liable, as his action alone caused the damage, and the other five could not have done anything to prevent it as he was leaning upon them.
The Gemara explains: The ruling is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that when one causes damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s direct </span><span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not equivalent to </span>a situation where one causes damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body. </span>If he broke the bench by actually sitting down upon it, his action would be considered a direct act of damage completed with his body and he alone would be liable even though the other peoples’ weight was a contributing factor. In this case, since he broke the bench by merely leaning upon the others sitting there, it is his force that led to the damage, not his body, and one might have thought that since the weight of the others certainly contributed to the breakage they should share liability. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>causing damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s direct force is equivalent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>causing damage with <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And it teaches that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that anywhere that </span>one would be liable if <span class="gemarra-regular">his body broke </span>something, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span> liable if <span class="gemarra-regular">his force broke </span>something.
The Gemara continues to consider the possibility that there are additional cases covered by the mishna’s ruling aside from the one listed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there not more </span>cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>also the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was beaten by ten peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with ten sticks,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>they beat him <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously or one after the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he died, they are all exempt </span>from liability for killing him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>Where they beat him <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially, the last </span>individual to beat him alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, because he hastened his death. </span>In this case, the other individuals contributed to the man’s death, but the last one alone is liable. Why didn’t the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also mention this case?
The Gemara explains: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not speaking of </span>one’s liability to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the death penalty, </span>only of one’s liability to pay damages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speaking of </span>an issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we uphold that </span>the case stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning a pit is subject to a dispute, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, but of the Rabbis? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">We will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and not </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, but <span class="gemarra-regular">we will not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interpret </span>it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>In other words, although we will interpret the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring to a case that is subject to a dispute, that applies only if it is in accordance with the majority opinion in that dispute.
§ The mishna teaches: In any case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">I facilitated part of the damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable for payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage it </span>caused, as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage. The Gemara notes that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am liable for the damage it </span>caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather: </span>I am liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage it </span>caused. The Hebrew terms: Payments of restitution [<span class="it-text">tashlumim</span>], and: To complete [<span class="it-text">lehashlim</span>], share the same Hebrew root. This alludes to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the payment of damages is required only in order to complete the injured party’s compensation, which is already partially accounted for, as the injured party is able to recover his dead animal’s current value by selling its carcass. Accordingly, the one liable for the damage is not required to pay the animal’s prior value; rather, he must pay only the difference in its value from before it was damaged and its current state.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this, as the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The mishna uses the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Payments</span> of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage, </span>as opposed to simply stating: One is liable for the damage caused, to allude to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the one who is liable must pay only for the decrease in the value of the animal. This assumes that the injured party is able to recover his animal’s current value by selling the carcass. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the owner </span>of the injured animal <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., retains ownership of, <span class="gemarra-regular">the animal carcass </span>so that, if he wishes to, he may sell it and keep the proceeds.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said: As the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “One who strikes an animal shall pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yeshallemenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 24:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read </span>the final word <span class="gemarra-italic">yeshallemenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning he shall pay for it; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>read it as though it were vocalized as <span class="gemarra-italic">yashlimenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning he shall complete it, to teach that he shall complete the injured party’s compensation, which is already partially accounted for by the injured party’s right to sell his animal’s carcass.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said</span> that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee who did not fulfill his duty to safeguard it, and the animal was attacked by a wild beast: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If it be torn in pieces, let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him bring a witness, the torn animal he shall not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pay” </span>(Exodus 22:12). Rav Kahana expounds the verse to mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall pay </span>only up <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">torn animal; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall not pay </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">torn animal itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, he pays only the difference in value between the animal before it was injured and its current torn state. If the owner of the injured animal wishes to fully recover his loss he must sell the animal’s carcass and keep the proceeds.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiyya said</span> that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>The verse states with regard to a person’s ox that fatally gored another ox: “He shall pay an ox for the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass shall be his” </span>(Exodus 21:36), meaning the carcass belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the injured </span>party, the owner of the gored animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be his” </span>(Exodus 21:36). The verse means the carcass belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the injured </span>party. Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the injured </span>party? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for the damage? </span>To this suggestion, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should say: It could not have been that.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean by: <span class="gemarra-regular">It could not have been </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: If it enters your mind </span>to say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass is </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage, let the Merciful One write: </span>“He shall pay <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox for the ox,” and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be silent </span>and state no more. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the verse to continue: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his”? Conclude from it </span>that the carcass belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to have multiple sources for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Merciful One wrote </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal shall pay for it,” </span>I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is an uncommon </span>occurrence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a torn animal, which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a common </span>occurrence, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will say </span>that his liability should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be limited to the difference in value between what the animal had been worth and the carcass, but he should pay for the entire value of the injured animal. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to explicitly state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> also in that case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">had taught us only </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">torn animal, </span>I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the damage occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>i.e., it was not directly caused by the one liable for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who strikes an animal, </span>who does so <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action, I will say that </span>his liability should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be limited. Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> also in that case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">had taught us only these two </span>cases, I could claim that only in those cases does one have to pay for only part of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon </span>occurrence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the damage occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself. But </span>in a case where one’s ox gores another’s ox, of which the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be his</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” which is a common </span>occurrence, and the damage is considered to have been inflicted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>its owner’s direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since it was under his guard, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will say </span>his liability should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be limited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">had taught us </span>only the case in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be his,” </span>I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of one who strikes another’s animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">where one causes damage with </span>one’s own <span class="gemarra-regular">body, I will say </span>his liability should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be limited. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to explicitly state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in each case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rav: But </span>according to the statement of Ḥizkiyya, as explained by Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>the injured party retains ownership of the carcass is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wrote: “And the carcass shall be his,” </span>but were <span class="gemarra-regular">it not for that I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the carcass</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rav Kahana questions the need for the Torah to teach this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>in his possession the carcasses of <span class="gemarra-regular">several </span><span class="gemarra-regular">torn animals, he could give </span>the injured party a carcass as payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Master said </span>above (7a): The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall recompense” </span>(Exodus 21:34), <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money, and even bran, </span>a relatively inferior commodity, as valid items with which to pay restitution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the Torah to teach that he can pay restitution with <span class="gemarra-regular">his, </span>i.e., the injured party’s, animal carcass? Granting ownership of the carcass to the injured party seems pointless, because even had the Torah granted it to the one liable for the damage, he could give it to the injured party as payment.
The Gemara explains: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only for </span>the issue of who sustains the loss due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> between its death and when the case is brought before the court. By granting ownership of the carcass to the injured party from the moment of the animal’s death, the Torah limits the damages to the difference between the value of the animal when it was alive and its value immediately after it is killed, irrespective of what happens to the carcass afterward.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that the issue of the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee and was attacked by a wild beast: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If it be torn in pieces, let him bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a witness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 22:12). 

Daf 11a

This means that the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">should bring witnesses that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mauled through circumstances beyond </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">control, and </span>based on their testimony he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul says: </span>The word <span class="it-text">ed</span> should not be interpreted as witness, but as carcass. Accordingly, the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">carcass [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aduda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to court </span>in order to appraise its current value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree about this </span>matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Abba Shaul, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the loss due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass is </span>sustained <span class="gemarra-regular">by the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party, and so there is a need to appraise its value immediately in order to correctly assess how much the one liable for the damage must pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the loss due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass is </span>sustained <span class="gemarra-regular">by the one liable for the damage </span>because the Torah granted him ownership of it.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>agrees that the loss due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass is </span>sustained <span class="gemarra-regular">by the injured</span> party, since he owns it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here they disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>who must go to <span class="gemarra-regular">the effort </span>of retrieving the <span class="gemarra-regular">carcass </span>and transporting it to the court to be appraised.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Others say: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the owner of the pit to raise the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his pit </span>after it was killed by falling into it? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“The owner of the pit shall pay; <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall restore money to its owner,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the carcass </span>shall be his” (Exodus 21:34). They read the term “and the carcass” as a second subject of the term “he shall restore.” It therefore indicates that the one liable for the damage must restore the carcass to the injured party by retrieving it. The fact that this opinion is introduced with the phrase: Others say, suggests that it stands in opposition to another opinion. That other opinion apparently holds that the owner of the injured animal is responsible for retrieving the carcass.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: What are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the circumstances </span>in which the one liable for the damage is required to go to <span class="gemarra-regular">this effort, </span>to retrieve the <span class="gemarra-regular">carcass </span>from the pit?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>while still <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the pit, </span>the carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">worth a dinar, and </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">at the edge </span>of the pit, since it is more accessible, its market value increases and <span class="gemarra-regular">is worth four </span>dinars, then <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">expends the effort </span>to retrieve the carcass, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">expending the effort for his own </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sake, </span>since by increasing the value of the carcass he reduces his own liability. Therefore, he will certainly retrieve it of his own accord, and it is not necessary for the Torah to require him to do so.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to require him to retrieve the carcass in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>while still <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>the carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">is worth </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar, and </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">at the edge </span>of the pit, despite being more accessible, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is still worth </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar. </span>Since it is of no benefit to him to retrieve it, the Torah had to require him to do so.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is there </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">a case </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like this, </span>where despite being more accessible its market value does not change? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, as people say, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a beam </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the city </span>sells <span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinar, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the field </span>also sells <span class="gemarra-regular">for a dinar, </span>despite the fact that it needs to be transported from there to the city.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The practice of the court is that when an animal or other item is stolen and then is damaged or dies, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>its current value and assign ownership of it to its owner, in order that the perpetrator should have to pay only the difference between its prior value and its current value, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief nor for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber. </span>Rather, the thief or robber acquires ownership of the carcass or damaged item and compensates the owner for its prior value. The court appraises the item or carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">only for damages</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the Gemara explained above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I say </span>that they appraise the item or animal <span class="gemarra-regular">even for a borrowe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> who borrowed an item and while it was in his possession it became damaged, or who borrowed an animal and while it was in his possession it died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to me.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma was raised before them: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this what </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the value of an item or a carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">even for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a borrower, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Abba concedes to me; or perhaps, this is what </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: And I say </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not appraise </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">even for a borrower, and Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to me?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the following incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed an a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from another and he broke it. He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came before Rav </span>to rule if, and how much, he was liable to pay for it. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Go and pay him with a full-fledged ax, </span>i.e., you must compensate the owner for the full value of the ax that you broke. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>its value for the sake of a borrower.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rav </span>on that occasion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? And</span> Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">remained silent, </span>this suggests that he conceded to their opinion that the borrower should not have had to pay the full value of the ax. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it</span> that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>an item’s value for the sake of a borrower.
An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>a stolen item’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">for a thief and for a robber. Rav Pappi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: It does not appraise </span>its value for them. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not appraise </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">either for a thief or for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but it appraises </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">for a borrower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana and Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Asi.</span>
§ The Gemara cites additional <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: When a woman gives birth or miscarries a fetus she is thereby rendered ritually impure (see Leviticus 12:1–5). Even if she delivers only the afterbirth, with no discernible fetus, she is rendered ritually impure due to the possibility that the fetus was dissolved in the afterbirth, and it is therefore considered as though she delivered it (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 24b). The length of the period of impurity depends on the sex of the child. In the case where it is unclear what the sex is, she must observe the longer period of fourteen days (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 29a). At the end of that period she may purify herself by immersing in a ritual bath. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">part of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">afterbirth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shilya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged on the first day </span>of a woman’s miscarriage <span class="gemarra-regular">and part of it </span>emerged <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second day, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counts </span>the period of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">from the first </span>day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him, </span>to Ulla: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the rationale for <span class="gemarra-regular">your opinion </span>to begin counting from the first day? It would appear to be based on the following: Ritual impurity is engendered only once the woman has delivered the fetus. This is defined as the emergence of the majority of the fetus or its head. Since in this case the fetus is not discernible, one must consider the possibility that it had already emerged on the first day, and therefore one is required <span class="gemarra-regular">to act stringently </span>and regard her as impure from the first day.
Rava questions the propriety of acting stringently in this case, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency that results in a leniency, because </span>if she begins counting from the first day, <span class="gemarra-regular">you will </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">render her </span>fit to immerse and become <span class="gemarra-regular">pure from </span>fourteen days <span class="gemarra-regular">after the first </span>day. This is a leniency because it is possible that the majority of the fetus emerged only on the second day and therefore her period of impurity began only then. She will therefore remain impure until the fifteenth day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to being concerned </span>for the possibility that she is impure from the first day, <span class="gemarra-regular">she should be concerned. </span>But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">counting </span>the period of impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counts only from the second </span>day.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>through this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does he mean to teach us <span class="gemarra-regular">that part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the afterbirth </span>does not emerge <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">fetus </span>inside? But <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 77a): When an animal is ritually slaughtered, the animal and everything inside it becomes permitted for consumption. This applies to an unborn fetus as well. If prior to the slaughter the majority of the fetus emerged, it is considered to have been born, and therefore the entire fetus, even the part that is still within its mother, is not rendered permitted for consumption by the slaughter. Accordingly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the afterbirth emerged </span>prior to the slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited to eat </span>it, because an afterbirth is <span class="gemarra-regular">a sign</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a fetus in a woman </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a sign of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fetus in an animal.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>I would know this only <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mishna, I would say</span>

Daf 11b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that there is</span> a possibility that <span class="gemarra-regular">part of the afterbirth </span>will emerge <span class="gemarra-regular">without</span> part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the fetus </span>inside, and the reason that the Sages forbid eating the afterbirth is due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>prohibiting a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">part of </span>an afterbirth emerges from the womb and part of it remains inside, <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the possibility that one may confuse it with a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the afterbirth emerges. Therefore, Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that, in fact, part of the afterbirth does not emerge without part of the fetus inside.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>With regard to a male <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>child <span class="gemarra-regular">who was maule</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">within thirty day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of his birth and died, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not required to redeem him, </span>as the requirement to do so, by paying five <span class="it-text">sela</span> to a priest, applies only once the child is thirty days old (see Numbers 18:15–16).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is stated:</span> “Yet <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall redeem” </span>(Numbers 18:15), one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if a male firstborn child was <span class="gemarra-regular">mauled </span>by an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">within thirty days </span>of his birth one should redeem him. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “yet </span>you shall redeem”; the addition of the word “yet” serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">differentiate </span>and limit the requirement to redeem the firstborn male.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar says: A large animal, </span>such as a cow or a horse, <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired by </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling </span>the animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 25b): A large animal is acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by passing </span>the reins of the animal to the buyer? The Gemara explains: Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This and that, </span>i.e., both large and small animals, are acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">pullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon says: This and that </span>are acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting </span>the animal.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who divid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the estate they inherited, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises whatever </span>clothes are <span class="gemarra-regular">upon them </span>if those clothes came from, or if they were purchased with money from, the deceased’s estate, and that sum is considered part of the portion they receive. But the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not appraise whatever is upon their sons and daughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In order to save the children from the humiliation of having to appear in court, the brothers waive their rights to the clothes the children are wearing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Sometimes, it does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not even appraise what-ever is upon </span>the brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">You find</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eldest brothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> where the other brothers waive their rights to the value of his clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is beneficial for them </span>to have the eldest brother appear well dressed in order <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when he represents their interests in dealings with others, <span class="gemarra-regular">his words will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be listened to </span>and respected.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conveyed </span>a deposit that was entrusted to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee, </span>the first bailee is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary </span>to state this in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee who conveyed </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to a paid bailee,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thereby increasing </span>the level of <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding, </span>since the paid bailee has a greater level of accountability than an unpaid bailee. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a paid bailee who conveyed </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee, thereby decreasing </span>the level of <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In this case, the first bailee is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he conveyed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a mentally competent person </span>and thereby fulfilled his responsibility to ensure the deposit is safeguarded.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee who conveyed </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> another <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the first bailee becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for any loss to the item, even for mishaps for which he would not have been liable had he kept the deposit with him. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not necessary </span>to state this in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> paid bailee who conveyed </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, thereby decreasing </span>the level of <span class="gemarra-regular">its safeguarding. Rather, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bailee who conveyed </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to a paid bailee, </span>thereby increasing the level of its safeguarding; he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The reason he is liable is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: You are credible to me with regard to </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other bailee, to whom you conveyed my item, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not credible to me with regard to</span> taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>If an occurrence for which a bailee does not carry liability occurs, damaging the deposit, in order to release himself from an obligation to pay the bailee must take an oath to the item’s owner that none of the types of occurrences for which he bears liability occurred. Rava rules that the owner is required to accept an oath only from the bailee with whom he entrusted his item, but not from anyone else. Accordingly, since the first bailee was not present when the event occurred, he is unable to attest to what happened, and even if the second bailee takes an oath to that effect, the owner is not expected to accept his oath. Consequently, the first bailee bears full liability for any loss.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar says: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can collect from </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">the slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that he owns as payment for a debt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to Ulla: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when collecting <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a debtor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans? </span>A creditor can collect the debt from orphans only by taking the land the debtor bequeathed to his children. Rav Naḥman asked whether this also extends to collecting any slaves the children inherited. Ulla replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>a creditor collects a debt by taking slaves only when he collects directly <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the debtor himself. Rav Naḥman challenges this: But when the creditor collects <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>he can collect the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the cloak that is upon his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shoulders, </span>and therefore he can certainly also collect the debt by taking his slaves, so what is the novelty of this ruling?
Ulla explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>his slave <span class="gemarra-regular">as designated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repayment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">appoteiki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, if the slave was subsequently sold to a third party and the debtor was later unable to repay the debt, the creditor can seize the slave from the third party as payment of the debt. Even though generally only land can be seized from a buyer as payment for the seller’s debt, a slave is considered to have similar status to land in this regard. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If a master <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside his slave </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repayment </span>of a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him, </span>the master’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor collects </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>taking the slave; but if one set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repaymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor does not collect</span> the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>taking the ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this difference? The Gemara explains: The designation of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>slave generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since a slave is significant and identifiable, therefore any prospective buyer is assumed to have been aware of the status of the slave and accepted the consequences of purchasing him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the designation of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span> generate <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity, </span>since one ox is not easily distinguishable from another, and a buyer cannot be assumed to be aware that the ox was set aside as designated repayment. Therefore it is unfair that one who purchases such an ox should have it seized from him. Therefore, the Sages enacted that a creditor cannot do so. 

Daf 12a

The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">exited </span>the study hall, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said to </span>the remaining Sages in the study hall: In truth, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>A slave can be collected as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when collecting <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the debtor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Generally, when collecting a debt from the debtor’s orphans the creditor can collect only from the land that they inherited from their father, which is liened to the debt. Rabbi Elazar rules that a creditor can also collect from the slaves they inherited, as he holds that in this regard, the legal status of slaves is like that of land. Ulla did not reveal this fact to Rav Naḥman, as he knew that Rav Naḥman disagreed and held that the legal status of slaves is like that of movable property. When he heard of Ulla’s revelation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Ulla evaded me, </span>as had he told me Rabbi Elazar’s full opinion, I would have brought proofs against his opinion.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident in Neharde’a, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the judges of Neharde’a collected, </span>on behalf of a creditor, slaves that orphans had inherited from the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was an incident in Pumbedita, and Rav Ḥana bar Bizna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collected </span>slaves from orphans as repayment for a debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said to </span>those judges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and return </span>those slaves to the orphans, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>you do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we will collect </span>the value of the slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds of <span class="gemarra-regular">your own mansions </span>in order to compensate the orphans for their loss, as you have made a elementary mistake in your ruling and therefore you are responsible to rectify it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: There is Ulla,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is Rabbi Elazar, there are the judges of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a, and there is Rav Ḥana bar Bizna, </span>all of whom ruled based on the assumption that the legal status of slaves is like that of land. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does the Master, </span>i.e., you, Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold?</span>
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I know a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that supports my opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Avimi teaches: A document that prevents the Sabbatical</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Year from abrogating an outstanding debt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effect upon </span>a debt assumed by one who owns <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>a <span class="it-text">prosbol</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take effect upon </span>a debt assumed by one who owns <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves </span>of the debtor. And <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property is acquired together with the lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> one acquires through the act of acquisition performed on the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be acquired together with the slaves</span> that one acquires. Both <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> assume that in these cases the legal status of slaves is not like that of land.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this issue is the <span class="gemarra-regular">subject of </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> in the following <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>.
One <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sold slaves and lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>a buyer and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the slaves </span>alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">land. </span>If he took possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the land </span>alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one sold <span class="gemarra-regular">land and movable property to </span>a buyer and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the land </span>alone, he thereby also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the movable property. </span>If he took possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of the movable property </span>alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the land. </span>If one sold <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves and movable property to</span> a buyer and the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the slaves</span> alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the movable property. </span>If he took possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of the movable property </span>alone, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire the slaves.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of the slaves </span>alone, he thereby also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the movable property? </span>This directly contradicts the ruling in the parallel clause of the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span>and the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage,</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property?</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to everyone, </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, and </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that by taking possession of the slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the movable property, is <span class="gemarra-regular">properly </span>understood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which is taught </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that in such a case he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the movable property, the reason for this ruling is that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that in order for movable property to be acquired together with land, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that he acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">land similar to “fortified cities in Judea” </span>(II Chronicles 21:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">which do not move around. </span>Slaves, even if their legal status is generally like that of land, do not fulfill this requirement.
The reason behind the need for land to be like the “fortified cities in Judea” is that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one can acquire movable property together with land is derived from this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Property that does not serve as a guarantee, </span>i.e., movable property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired together with property that does serve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a guarantee, </span>i.e., land, be it <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the buyer giving <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>to the seller, by the seller giving the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill </span>of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">or by </span>the buyer performing an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where is this matter </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiyya said: As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And their father gave them great </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with fortified cities in Judea” </span>(II Chronicles 21:3). The verse indicates that the acquisition of the movable property was done together with that of the cities of Judea.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that Rav Ika stated a different answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to everyone, </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, and </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught</span> in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that by taking possession of the slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the movable property, is <span class="gemarra-regular">properly </span>understood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which is taught </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that in such a case he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the movable property, applies to a case in which at the moment the slave was acquired, the movable property was <span class="gemarra-regular">still upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., the slave was holding it, and it could therefore be acquired together with the slave. This is because one’s slave is considered like one’s courtyard, and any item that is placed within it is acquired for its owner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But even if </span>the movable property was <span class="gemarra-regular">still upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, what of it? </span>Even if one claims a slave is like a courtyard, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mobile courtyard, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mobile courtyard does not acquire </span>items placed upon it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where the slave is standing </span>at the time of the transaction, that is still insufficient, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Anything that does not acquire when moving </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">standing or sitting. </span>The fact that the slave can move gives him the status of a mobile courtyard, regardless if he is currently moving or not.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a slave is <span class="gemarra-regular">bound u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> and is unable to walk, his status is like that of an immobile courtyard, and his master will acquire anything that is placed upon him at that time.
The Gemara presents another contradiction to the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above, which explicitly states that one cannot acquire slaves by taking possession of land: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took possession of the land </span>alone, he thereby also <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves?</span>
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> just cited, the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are standing within </span>the borders of the land that was acquired.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not acquire </span>the slaves, is stated with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing within </span>the borders of the land that was acquired.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This works out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well according to that </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">formulation of </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ika, son of Rav Ami, said, </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property. This is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the slaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are standing within </span>the borders of the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>they are acquired together with the land, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, no, </span>they are not acquired. The Gemara assumes that movable property is acquired together with land only if at the time of the acquisition it is placed upon the land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">formulation </span>of that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <span class="gemarra-regular">said, that </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">land, why do I </span>need the slaves to be <span class="gemarra-regular">standing within </span>the borders of the land? As <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Shmuel say: </span>If someone <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him ten fields, </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in ten </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">countries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once he takes possession of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one of them, he has acquired all of them? </span>If the legal status of slaves is like that of land, then the same principle should apply to them, and it should be unnecessary for them to be standing within the land’s borders.
The Gemara reconsiders: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your reasoning, </span>one can ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to</span> the second <span class="gemarra-regular">formulation of </span>that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <span class="gemarra-regular">said, that </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, why do I </span>need the slaves to be <span class="gemarra-regular">standing within </span>the borders of the land? 

Daf 12b

Don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">we maintain </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>movable property <span class="gemarra-regular">to be piled u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> upon the land one acquires in order to acquire the movable property together with it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say?</span> Perforce, <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property that moves around </span>by itself, such as slaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from movable property that does not move</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> around </span>by itself, i.e., inanimate objects. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that movable property does not need to be piled up upon the land applies only to the latter. Accordingly, in order to acquire slaves together with land, they must be standing within its borders.
Given this distinction, one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, also, </span>an entity legally classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">land that moves around, </span>such as a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from land that does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">move around. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, </span>which is classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that moves around, </span>is not included in Shmuel’s ruling, as in his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>he refers only to acquiring multiple plots of land, which is possible only because the <span class="gemarra-regular">crust [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sadna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the earth is one </span>block, and therefore each field is really only one part of a bigger whole. This rationale does not permit acquiring land and slaves together, as a slave is not attached to the earth and is separate from the land.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable only with regard to damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>were he to use it for a non-sacred purpose, he <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">misus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of consecrated property.
The Gemara infers: The property in question <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not have </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is consecrated </span>property, yet one is still liable for causing damage to it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who holds like this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings of lesser sanctity and is in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says </span>that such offerings, before they are slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">property of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">owners, </span>as opposed to property of Heaven. It is only once such an offering is slaughtered that it becomes subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of misuse of consecrated property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And commits a trespass against the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case in which one denies having in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings of lesser sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are property of </span>their owners. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we learn </span>in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 52b): In the case of a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>of an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it is from offerings of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the most sacred orde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or from offerings of lesser sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, she is not betrothed? Shall we say that </span>this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> HaGelili?</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said </span>that offerings of lesser sanctity are the property of their owners, that applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal is still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But after </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi Yosei HaGelili concedes </span>that the offering takes on a higher degree of sanctity and is now the property of Heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">As when they receiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> their portions, they do not receive them because those portions belong to them; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">they receive </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the table of the Most High</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., they have the right to partake of them, but do not own them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he say </span>his opinion only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the offering is still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma</span><span class="it-text">’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 1:2): With regard to the male <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>of a kosher animal, which is endowed upon its birth with the sanctity of an offering of lesser sanctity, a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may sell it </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but he may not sell it once it is slaughtered, as if an unblemished firstborn animal is slaughtered it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">blemished, </span>one can sell it both when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive or </span>after it is <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered, and one can betroth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a woman with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This mishna assumes that even when a firstborn animal is unblemished it is considered to be the property of the priest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn</span> animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the present</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since it is not fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be sacrificed, </span>as there is no Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priests have ownership of it. But when the Temple is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrificed, no. </span>When the Temple is standing a priest may slaughter and eat the firstborn only if it becomes blemished. Nowadays, since it is not possible to offer it as a sacrifice, it is certain that the animal will eventually develop a blemish and the priest will then be permitted to slaughter and eat it. Consequently, the priest is considered to have ownership of the firstborn even before it develops any blemish.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: The verse states: “A person who sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and commits a trespass against the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case in which one denies having in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings of lesser sanctity, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are the property of </span>their owners; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement is clearly referring to a time when the Temple is standing, as it is based on a verse that continues to obligate one to bring a guilt-offering. Nevertheless, he states that offerings of lesser sanctity, of which a firstborn is an example, are considered to be the property of their owners even when they are unblemished.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ravina answered </span>that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and is in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, who says: If </span>firstborn animals <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span> from outside of Eretz Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael and they are <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished, they may be sacrificed </span>on the altar. From Rabbi Shimon’s formulation it is apparent that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they came, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>they are sacrificed, but they should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be brought <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the firstborn animals should not be brought to Eretz Yisrael, they are considered unfit to be sacrificed, and therefore they are considered to be the property of the priest even before they develop a blemish.
It is apparent that Ravina understood Rav Naḥman’s qualification to be true even according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Therefore, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is so that when Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said </span>that an offering of lesser sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">is the property of </span>its owner, that was referring only to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>they are still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, </span>

Daf 13a

<span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">answe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> Rava’s objection by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that an offering of lesser sanctity is the property of its owner and may be sold even when the Temple stands, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </span>and it is referring to a case where the animal is still alive. And <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>qualification of the mishna by Rav Naḥman, that the sale of an unblemished firstborn animal when the Temple is standing is invalid, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who dispute Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him </span>that this is not difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you speak </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>to which members <span class="gemarra-regular">of the priesthoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> are entitled, of which a firstborn animal is an example? <span class="gemarra-regular">Gifts of the priesthood are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>from other offerings of lesser sanctity, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>their portions, <span class="gemarra-regular">they receive </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the table </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Most High. </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili claims that the act of consecration of an animal as an offering of lesser sanctity does not nullify one’s ownership of the animal. The sanctity of a firstborn offering takes effect with its birth, so it may be that it was never owned; rather, it is reasonable that the Torah provided the priest only with the right and the obligation to partake of it after it is sacrificed.
§ The Gemara considers <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: Concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> commits a trespass against the Lord, </span>and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case in which one denies having in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of lesser sanctity, which are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of </span>their owners, and are included in the phrase “and deals falsely with his neighbor.” This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaGelili. Ben Azzai says: </span>This phrase serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offerings. Abba Yosei ben Dosta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Ben Azzai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said this only with regard to a firstborn </span>offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai says: </span>This phrase serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include peace-offerings. </span>The Gemara asks: Ben Azzai’s interpretation of the phrase, limiting its interpretation to a reference only to peace-offerings, is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a firstborn</span> offering, because he holds that a firstborn is not the property of the priest, one could reject this, as the sanctity of a firstborn offering is a lesser sanctity than that of a peace-offering, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">peace-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which </span>have a higher degree of sanctity such that <span class="gemarra-regular">they require placing hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on the head of the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>are accompanied by <span class="gemarra-regular">libation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the waving of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">breast and </span>the right <span class="gemarra-regular">hind le</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> by the priest and owner together, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the property of the owners, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it necessary </span>to state that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn</span> offering, for which these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> do not apply, that the priest has ownership of it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: </span>Ben Azzai mentioned peace-offerings in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>offering, i.e., every tenth animal of one’s flock that is designated as tithe for those ten animals and is sacrificed as an offering of lesser sanctity. Animal tithes are excluded because ben Azzai holds that an animal tithe offering is not the property of the owner of the flock.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a firstborn </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “You</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall not redeem” </span>(Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the firstborn offering <span class="gemarra-regular">can be sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, or </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">blemished </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or </span>blemished and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered. With regard to </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed” </span>(Leviticus 27:33), indicating that the one who designated it can never fully redeem an animal tithe offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the animal tithe offering <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be sold, not </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive and not </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished and not </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">blemished. </span>The fact that the sale of an animal tithe offering is invalid demonstrates that it is not the property of the one who designated it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina taught </span>the preceding discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Yosei ben Dostai says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai said this only with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborn </span>offering. The Gemara asks: Abba Yosei ben Dostai’s interpretation of the phrase, limiting its interpretation to a reference only to a firstborn offering, is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude peace-offerings, </span>because he holds that they are not the property of the one who consecrated them as offerings, one could reject this, as the sanctity of peace-offerings is a lesser sanctity than that of a firstborn offering, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified </span>upon its emergence <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the womb </span>yet nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">is the property of </span>the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it necessary </span>to state that <span class="gemarra-regular">peace-offerings </span>are the property of those who consecrated them, where the animals were already the property of its owner before they were consecrated?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>Abba Yosei ben Dostai mentioned peace-offerings in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>offering. Animal tithes are excluded because Abba Yosei ben Dostai that an animal tithe offering is not the property of the owner of the flock.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “You shall not redeem”</span> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the firstborn offering <span class="gemarra-regular">can be sold </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, or</span> when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">blemished </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, or </span>blemished and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.

The Gemara asks: How can one claim that Abba Yosei ben Dostai holds that peace-offerings are also owned by those who consecrated them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>Abba Yosei ben Dostai <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Ben Azzai said this <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to a firstborn </span>offering. The Gemara concedes: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the mishna’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: What </span>does the mishna mean when it says: One is liable only for damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>were one to use it for a mundane purpose, one <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">property that is not </span>at all <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of misuse </span>of consecrated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is that? </span>It is referring to any property <span class="gemarra-regular">of an ordinary person, </span>which has no sanctity at all.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>explicitly: One is liable only for damage caused to property <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary individual. </span>The Gemara concedes: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba says: </span>With regard to the case of an innocuous animal that was consecrated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that caused damage, </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., from the portion of the offering that would have been eaten by its owners. This is in accordance with the general <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is collected exclusively from the proceeds of the sale of the body of the ox and not from any other property of its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he does not collect </span>the damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sacrificial </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portions.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one collects exclusively from the meat portion and not from the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial portions, </span>as those are <span class="gemarra-regular">to be offered up to God?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for Rabbi Abba to teach that there is no <span class="gemarra-regular">collection from </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial portions. </span>Payment for damage caused by an innocuous animal is half the amount of the damages, and can be no more than the value of the animal itself. Rabbi Abba is teaching that when assessing the damage to determine the amount to be paid, one deems the owner responsible only according to his share of the animal, i.e., the meat portions, in relation to the animal as a whole.
Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis engage in a dispute concerning the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case in which an ox pushed another animal into a pit (see 53a). If it were an innocuous ox, for which the Torah limits the owner’s liability to half the damages, the Rabbis rule that liability is incurred exclusively by the owner of the ox, i.e., he pays half the value of the damage, and the owner of the pit is entirely exempt. Rabbi Natan holds that since the damage was caused jointly by the ox and the pit, the owner of the ox need pay only half of what he would pay if his animal had been solely responsible, i.e., a quarter of the damages. Rabbi Natan further rules that the remaining sum can then be fully recovered from the owner of the pit, i.e., he pays the remaining three-quarters of the damages. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion, of those <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, does Rabbi Abba state his ruling?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>then it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>and there is no need to state it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Whenever, </span>for whatever reason, the full cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be recovered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not recovered from that </span>party, i.e., even though the injured party suffered the loss of the full value of his animal and recovered only half its value from the owner of the ox, he may not demand the remaining sum from the owner of the pit. So too, in this case, where the injured party cannot collect damages from the sacrificial portions, he cannot recover that loss from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Natan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, doesn’t he say: Whenever </span>the full cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be recovered from this </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recovered from that </span>one, i.e., since the owner of the ox pays only a quarter of the damages, the remaining sum can be recovered from the owner of the pit. So too, in this case, since the injured party cannot collect payment from the sacrificial portions, he should be able to recover that loss from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering, in contrast to the ruling of Rabbi Abba.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, and if you wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say </span>his ruling is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>as one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter, </span>the ruling of the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the damage is caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bodies, </span>such as an ox and a pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But where </span>the damage is caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one body, </span>as in the case of damage caused by a an animal consecrated as a peace-offering, the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">From anywhere that I want to, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I will recover </span>my losses, and accordingly, the injured party could collect the full cost of the damage from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering. Therefore, it is necessary for Rabbi Abba to teach that this is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan: </span>It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">there that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the owner of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the pit: </span>Since <span class="gemarra-regular">I found my ox in your pit, </span>ultimately you bear responsibility for any damage, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I cannot recover from the other </span>one, i.e., the owner of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will recover from you. </span>

Daf 13b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of damage caused by an animal consecrated as a peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the injured party actually <span class="gemarra-regular">able to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Only the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage </span>but the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial portions did not cause damage? </span>Since the entire animal caused the damage, he does not collect the full cost of the damage from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>In the case of an innocuous animal consecrated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a thanks-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its meat, </span>i.e., from the portion of the offerings that would have been eaten by the one who brought the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not collect from its bread, </span>i.e., from the offering of forty loaves of bread that accompanies the sacrifice of the animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he does not collect from the <span class="gemarra-regular">bread? </span>The bread is not part of the animal that caused damage.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>for Rava to state this because of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of his ruling, which states: The <span class="gemarra-regular">injured</span> party <span class="gemarra-regular">eats </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>portions of the offering according to the value of the damages owed to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one achieving atonement, </span>i.e., the one bringing the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">brings the bread.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this also obvious? </span>Why should anyone else bring the bread? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say, since </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>is a necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">qualifying factor for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thanks-offering, </span>as without it one does not fulfill one’s obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the owner of the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the one eating it, why should <span class="gemarra-regular">you eat </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat and I bring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bread? </span>If you wish to eat, you should bring the bread. Therefore, Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the offering of the loaves of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread is the obligation of the owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the offering.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable only for damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">property that belongs to members of the covenant.</span>
The Gemara asks: This clause serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? If </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, isn’t that </span>already explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>(37b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox of a Je</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that gored an ox of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile, </span>the Jew is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>this as a principle in the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">and then explains </span>it in greater detail in the mishna below.
The mishna continues: One is liable only for <span class="gemarra-regular">assigned property. </span>The Gemara asks: This clause serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? Rav Yehuda said:</span> This clause serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case in which an animal is injured but it is unclear which of two oxen, owned by different people, caused the damage. The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your ox caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> ox <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Since it cannot be proven which ox actually caused the damage, neither owner is liable. The intention of the mishna is that one is liable only where the belligerent ox is assigned to, i.e., is known to be the property of, a specific individual.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t that </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">below</span> (35a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>seen <span class="gemarra-regular">pursuing a single </span>ox, and then the single ox is found to be injured, and the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your ox caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>And the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your ox caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are exempt </span>since it is uncertain which one is guilty. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>this as a principle in the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">explains </span>it in greater detail in the mishna below.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> in explanation of the mishna that the term assigned property serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude ownerless </span>property. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which the mishna teaches that one is exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where an ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belonging to us, </span>i.e., to a Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an ownerless ox, </span>it is obvious that the owner bears no liability, as <span class="gemarra-regular">who is claiming </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from him? Rather,</span> it must be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where an ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox gored an ox belonging to us, </span>and it teaches that the injured party does not have a right to damages.
The Gemara asks: What is the point of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If the injured party wishes to recover his losses, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him go and take </span>the belligerent ox for himself, since it is currently ownerless. The Gemara explains: The mishna teaches that the injured party does not have any right to the ox, in order to teach that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded him and acquired it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the injured party has no claim to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>an alternative interpretation of the mishna: The term assigned property serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case in which an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>it, or where <span class="gemarra-regular">it gored </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and subsequently </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">declared </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless. </span>Since the owners did not own the ox at the time the case was brought before the court, they are exempt from paying. Ravina explains that this is the intention of the mishna: That one is liable only when the property that caused the damage was owned a responsible party both when it caused the damage and when it was tried. In this case, at the time of the court hearing it was not owned by a responsible party, as it was either consecrated or ownerless.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that an ox that kills a person is stoned to death. The mishna states (44b) that this does not apply to an ox consecrated to the Temple or an ownerless ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said: Even </span>if an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored and </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently consecrated </span>it to the Temple, or if an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored and </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently declared</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“And if the ox was wont to gore in time past, <span class="gemarra-regular">and had been forewarned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with its owner, </span>and he had not guarded it in, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it killed a man </span>or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and also its owner shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:29). The repetition of the reference to the owner at the beginning and end of the verse indicates that the ox is not stoned <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at the time of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">standing trial is the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for both events.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But do we not </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">require</span> that the ox’s status be the same at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox shall be stoned” written with regard to </span>the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the owner of the ox is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the victim and at the time of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trial and at the verdict is the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for all three events.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable for damage caused in any place <span class="gemarra-regular">except for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a domain designated </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> responsible for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara explains the reason for this: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox want in my domain? </span>One does not have to guard his ox from causing damage within his own property, since another person’s animal has no right to be there.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one is liable for damage caused in <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage.</span>
The Gemara cites a dispute concerning this case that results in two different ways of interpreting the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>joint use of two <span class="gemarra-regular">partners, </span>either one of them is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused by the ox of one partner to the property of the other partner while <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and for the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling. And </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>One is liable for damage caused in any place <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain designated </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one responsible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage, as </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>there; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured</span> party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one responsible for the damage, when he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> causes damage, the one who is responsible for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is obligated </span>to pay damages. The statement in the mishna concerning a domain designated for joint use is the beginning of the following clause and introduces a case in which one is liable for damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>In a courtyard designated for joint use, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt for </span>one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and for </span>one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling. And</span> accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>One is liable for damage caused in any place <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain designated </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one responsible</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the damage, and </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">also exempt </span>for damage done in <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The statement in the mishna about a domain designated for joint use is a continuation of the previous clause and adds an additional case in which one is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the following clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">When one causes damage, the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the damage is obligated </span>to pay damages, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>the fact that one is liable for damage in the framework of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>which was not previously mentioned in the mishna.
This interpretation of the concluding clause of the mishna, as a reference to Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">works </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out well according to Shmuel, </span>in his dispute with Rav (3b) concerning the meaning of Ox and <span class="it-text">Maveh</span> in the first mishna of this chapter. According to Shmuel they mean Trampling and Eating, respectively, and Goring has yet to be addressed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rav, who says: </span>The term ox in the mishna includes damage caused by the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all matters </span>involving damaging actions <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>are completed by <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox, </span>including Goring, Eating, and Trampling, Goring is already addressed in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is added </span>by the clause: The <span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage is obligated </span>to pay damages?
The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that elucidates the mishna’s statement. The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for the damage </span>caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated </span>to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an animal, </span>e.g., an ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their possession. </span>If the ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damages, and </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full damages. </span>If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">broke open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at night, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">listin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> broke it open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>that the mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for the damage </span>caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated </span>to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee, a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lender’s ox, </span>which was under the watch of the borrower, <span class="gemarra-regular">injure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the borrower’s ox, </span>and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is teaching that the lender is liable to pay the borrower, why is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>my ox <span class="gemarra-regular">had injured </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the world </span>at large, i.e., someone else’s ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">you, </span>the borrower, <span class="gemarra-regular">would be required to pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as you were entrusted with safeguarding it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that </span>my ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has injured your ox, should I be required to pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that the borrower’s ox injure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lender’s ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is teaching that the borrower is liable to pay. The Gemara asks: According to this interpretation, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that if the belligerent ox was innocuous, the borrower is liable to pay only half of the damages. But why? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the borrower: By borrowing my ox, you undertook full responsibility for it such that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>my ox <span class="gemarra-regular">had been injured</span> by an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">from the world </span>at large, <span class="gemarra-regular">you would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be required to pay </span>me <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>value of my <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, </span>irrespective of whether the belligerent ox was considered innocuous or forewarned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">your ox that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> injured </span>my ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">should you </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damages? </span>This interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is also difficult.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where the lender’s ox injured</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the borrower’s ox, and with what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">undertook </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding the body of </span>the lender’s ox from being injured, 

Daf 14a

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he did not undertake </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the lender’s ox to prevent it <span class="gemarra-regular">from causing damage. </span>Accordingly, the lender remains responsible for his ox, and if it caused damage to the borrower’s ox the lender is liable, as in any other case in which his ox caused damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say, </span>and try to explain accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">broke open at night, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits broke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it open and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, </span>the bailee is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. The Gemara infers: If it broke open <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day </span>and then caused damage, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: According to the interpretation offered in explanation of the previous clause, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns a case in which one borrowed an ox but did not undertake the responsibility to prevent it from causing damage. If so, how can the latter clause imply that there are cases in which he is liable? If <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not undertake </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the lender’s ox to prevent it <span class="gemarra-regular">from causing damage, </span>he should never be liable for the damage that it caused.
The Gemara answers that the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns a different case than that of the previous clause. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If, </span>by contrast, the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">did undertake </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the lender’s ox to prevent it <span class="gemarra-regular">from causing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if it causes damage, the borrower is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>But if the ox was safely enclosed and the wall enclosing it <span class="gemarra-regular">broke open at night, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits broke</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it open and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara returns to its prior discussion of the mishna’s statement concerning property designated for the joint use of the injured party and the one liable for the damage. The Gemara cited Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that each partner is exempt from liability for any damage that falls within the categories of Trampling or Eating that their ox caused to the other partner’s property. The Gemara challenges his opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Yosef teach </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of partners, or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">an inn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pundak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for Eating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and for Trampling </span>caused by an ox of one partner to the property of the other. It would appear that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> provides a refutation of my opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Are there not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that disagree </span>with regard to this issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in accordance with my opinion in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (1:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elaza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would state four principles </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the liability incurred based on where the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>occurs. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>location <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damage, </span>the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for all </span>the damage caused there. If a place is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damage and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt for all </span>the damage caused there.
If a place is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">e.g., a courtyard </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of partners or </span>a field in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valley </span>that is jointly owned, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt for Eating and for Trampling</span> performed by his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>that place. But <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goring, and for pushing, and for biting, and for crouching </span>upon items in order to damage them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for kicking, </span>which are all subcategories of the primary category of Goring, if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
If a place where the damage occurs is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">e.g., a courtyard that is not</span> owned by either <span class="gemarra-regular">of the two of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eating and for Trampling </span>performed by his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>that place. But <span class="gemarra-regular">for goring, and for pushing, and for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">biting, and for crouching </span>upon items in order to damage them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for kicking, </span>which are all subcategories of the primary category of Goring, if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span> that in <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>designated for the joint use <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partners or </span>a field in <span class="gemarra-regular">the valley </span>that is jointly owned, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt for Eating and for Trampling </span>performed by his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>that place. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> supports Rabbi Elazar’s opinion.
The Gemara comments: These <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are difficult, </span>as they seem to contradict <span class="gemarra-regular">one another.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>which under the terms of their partnership is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated for </span>the use of both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, i.e., as partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">both produce and oxen </span>there. Since both partners have a right to keep their oxen there, they are not liable for any damage their oxen cause in the jointly owned space. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yosef </span>is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>which under the terms of their partnership is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated for </span>the purpose of bringing their <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is not designated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen </span>there. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>caused by one partner’s ox to the other’s produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>equivalent to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard </span>owned exclusively by <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party, and therefore he is liable.
The Gemara notes: In accordance with this explanation, the language of each of these <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">also precise, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rav Yosef, the case of a courtyard that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inn, </span>where oxen are usually not allowed to be brought, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it teaches there, </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the case of a courtyard that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>a field in the <span class="gemarra-regular">valley, </span>where oxen are usually allowed to enter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it </span>that the Gemara’s distinction between the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> is correct.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zeira objects to this </span>interpretation of Rav Yosef’s <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated for </span>both of them to keep their <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>there, they should not be liable for damage caused by their oxen there, as in order for one to be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">don’t we need </span>a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consumed in a field of another” </span>(Exodus 22:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since they both have the right to use the courtyard it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>fulfill this condition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not designated for </span>them to keep <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen </span>there, that is sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">for it to be termed “a field</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another.”</span>
Given the distinction between the cases discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, the Gemara reconsiders the dispute between Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar concerning the mishna’s statement about property whose use is designated for both the injured party and the one liable for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Difti said to Ravina: Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not disagree, </span>as they are referring to different cases, so too, the <span class="gemarra-italic">amora’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">also do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree, </span>as they are similarly referring to these different cases.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, </span>that is correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, </span>their dispute does not concern every case of a jointly owned courtyard, as the Gemara had assumed; rather, their dispute concerns specifically a courtyard designated for the use of their produce, but not the use of their oxen. And <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree whether </span>to accept <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty </span>raised <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Zeira, </span>that such a courtyard cannot be considered “a field of another,” <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> accept <span class="gemarra-regular">the resolution of Abaye, </span>that it can be considered “a field of another.”
§ The Gemara returns to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>and analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> cited above. It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar would state four principles with regard to </span>the liability incurred based on where the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>was caused. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>location <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the injured</span> party <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the damage, </span>the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for all </span>the damage caused there. If a place is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt for all [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the damage caused there.
The Gemara infers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach: </span>One is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">al</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>damage caused there, which would suggest that one is liable for all types of damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One is liable for all [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakkol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the damage caused, which can be translated as: <span class="gemarra-regular">For </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>This indicates that even were one’s ox considered to be innocuous and caused damage of the category of Goring, which would generally incur liability for half the value of the damage, in this case the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whose</span> opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, who says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>performed by an innocuous animal, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical, </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the injured </span>party, is that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>even if the ox is innocuous.
If this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>and try to explain accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a place where the damage occurs is the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">e.g., a courtyard that is not </span>owned by either <span class="gemarra-regular">of the two of them, </span>the owner of an animal that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for Eating and for Trampling</span> performed by his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>that place.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean by saying the property is <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the intention of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the property is <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person, why should either partner be liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t I need </span>a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it consumed in a field of another” </span>(Exodus 22:4), which is understood to mean that the consumed produce belongs to the owner of the field in which the act of consumption occurred; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since the injured party does not have any rights to this place it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>fulfill this condition?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is obvious </span>that the intention of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the property is <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one together; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them, i.e., the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause teaches: </span>If the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If so, in the latter clause <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>performed by an innocuous animal, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical, </span>occurring <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the injured</span> party, is that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: Could it be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and the last clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda</span> with regard to another mishna (15b): <span class="gemarra-italic">Shinnana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leave the mishna and follow after me </span>and my interpretation that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis. </span>In this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as well, the different clauses are taught in accordance with different Sages’ opinions.
The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said in the name of Rava: The entire</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and what </span>does it mean by saying that the property is <span class="gemarra-regular">of neither this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">nor that </span>one? The property does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>belong both <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it is designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the use of only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>him to keep his <span class="gemarra-regular">produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> there. Only the injured party has the right to keep his produce there. But it is designated both <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and for that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>them to keep their <span class="gemarra-regular">oxe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> there, as both have this right.
Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>damage of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to be the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard of the injured </span>party; therefore, the one responsible for the damage is liable to pay for the damage. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>since they both have the right to keep their oxen there, the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to be like <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, </span>and therefore even Rabbi Tarfon agrees that if one’s innocuous ox causes damage there one is liable for only half the value of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> list <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>principles? <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">three. </span>In other words, according to the way Ravina explains the latter clause, i.e., the fourth principle, it does not teach anything that is not already known from the first three principles, as the fact that one is liable for Eating and Trampling in property designated for the use of the injured party is explicitly stated in the first principle, and the fact that one is liable for only half the cost of the damage in a case of Goring in a jointly owned courtyard is expressed in the third principle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>

Daf 14b

There are only <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">principles, </span>but they are listed as four cases because they apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in four </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">places.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The determination of payment of damages is made by <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary appraisal. </span>One pays with items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">before a court. And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">based</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>who are <span class="gemarra-regular">free men, </span>i.e., men who are not Canaanite slaves, and who are <span class="gemarra-regular">members of the covenant, </span>i.e., Jews. <span class="gemarra-regular">And women </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are included in the </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>in the same way as men. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for the damage </span>are involved <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara will explicate each of these principles.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: The determination of payment of damages is made by <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary appraisal?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: This appraisal </span>of the damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">should be </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">only in terms of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value of the damage.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learn, </span>in this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>explicitly: In a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow damaged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cloak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak injured </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow, </span>e.g., the cow tread on it, thereby damaging it, and it became entangled in the cow’s legs, causing the cow to trip, <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not say </span>that it may be presumed that the damage to the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow is offset</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>the damage to the <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak and </span>the damage to the <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak is offset by </span>the damage to the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore the owners of both are exempt from any payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>separately the damage caused to each side <span class="gemarra-regular">in terms of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value and only then calculates to what extent the liabilities offset each other.
§ The mishna continues: With items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money; </span>to what does this refer?
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Payment is made with items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court attends to </span>the collection of damages <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in order to collect from <span class="gemarra-regular">property that serves as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>i.e., land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">proceeded, </span>of his own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">to seize movable property </span>from the one liable for the damage, the <span class="gemarra-regular">court collects </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">for him from those </span>items he seized. According to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to land.
The Gemara analyzes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Payment is made with items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court attends to </span>the collection of damages <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in order to collect from <span class="gemarra-regular">property that serves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a guarantee, </span>i.e., land. The phrase: Items worth money, therefore, is used as a term for land. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">something that is worth any </span>amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">what is that? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">something that is not subject </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>price <span class="gemarra-regular">fraud, </span>which is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to land. Unlike the sale of movable property, the sale of land is valid irrespective of the sum for which the land is sold. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But slaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and documents are also not subject to </span>price <span class="gemarra-regular">fraud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and yet these are not included in the phrase: Items worth money, as the court does not collect payments of damages from them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabba bar Ulla said: </span>The phrase is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is acquired with money, </span>which is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to land but not with regard to movable property (see <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 26a). The Gemara rejects this explanation: But <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and documents are also acquired with money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said:</span> The phrase is referring to something that is <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but is not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">money, and all these </span>things, i.e., movable property, slaves, and documents, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered like actual <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>because they have the defining characteristics of money in that they are valuable and portable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda bar Ḥinnana raises a contradiction </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: </span>In the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught: </span>The mishna’s statement that payment is made with items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money teaches that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">court attends to </span>the collection of damages <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in order to collect from <span class="gemarra-regular">property that serves as a guarantee,</span> i.e., land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is taught </span>also in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states the superfluous phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recompense” </span>(Exodus 21:34), <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">worth money, and even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bran, </span>a relatively inferior commodity, is accepted as a valid form of payment. The first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that only land is a valid form of payment, whereas the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that one may pay even with movable property.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what are we dealing here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that teaches that the court collects damages only from land? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where damages are collected from <span class="gemarra-regular">orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> whose father was liable to pay damages. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the liability inherited by the orphans applies only to the land they inherited from their father as it is liened to their father’s debts.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to collection <span class="gemarra-regular">from orphans, say, </span>and try to explain accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: But <span class="gemarra-regular">if the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">proceeded, </span>of his own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">to seize movable property </span>from the one liable for the damage, the <span class="gemarra-regular">court collects </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">for him from those </span>items he seized. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If, </span>as suggested, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to collection <span class="gemarra-regular">from orphans, why does the court collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him from those </span>items he seized, as the father’s movable property is not liened to his debts?
The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman says </span>with regard to a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 84a), which teaches that creditors who seize movable property as payment for a debt may keep those items: That is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he seized </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the debtor was still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here also, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he seized </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the one liable for the damage was still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Before a court. </span>What does this phrase mean?
This phrase should be understood as a qualification of the previous phrase in the mishna that teaches, as the Gemara explained, that a court collects damages only from land. The mishna then teaches that the court collects only from land that is still in the possession of the one liable for the damage when he appears in court. This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>a case where the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">sells his </span>landed <span class="gemarra-regular">property and afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goes to court. </span>Since at the time of the hearing he no longer owns land, the court does not collect damages from it.
The Gemara challenges this: Should we <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sells his </span>landed <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afterward </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to the court, the court does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collect </span>the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">from those </span>landed properties that he sold? This is certainly incorrect, as the creditor has a lien on the debtor’s property from the time that he borrows the money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the phrase: Before a court, should be understood as an independent clause that <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes a court of non-ordained judges</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyotot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> from judging all types of damages, as the payment for certain types of damage is considered to be a fine, and only expert judges who have been ordained are able to impose fines.
§ The mishna continues: Payment is made <span class="gemarra-regular">based </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses.</span>
The Gemara explains: This clause is stated to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>from liability one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses come afterwar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and testify that he is liable to pay it. The mishna teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>due to his admission.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well according to the one who says: One who admits</span> he is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses come afterward </span>and testify to his liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who admits </span>he is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses come afterward </span>and testify that he is guilty, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there to say </span>in explanation of this clause of the mishna?
The Gemara answers: This clause does not serve to exclude some other case; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is needed </span>to preface <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>that teaches that the only people who are accepted as witnesses in cases of damages are both

Daf 15a

<span class="gemarra-regular">free men and members of the covenant. </span>The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Free men, to exclude </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from being valid witnesses, and it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Members of the covenant, to exclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both exceptions, <span class="gemarra-regular">as had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only about <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, </span>I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <span class="gemarra-regular">because he has no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lineage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the child of a Canaanite slave is not legally considered to be his child in any sense; <span class="gemarra-regular">but a </span>free <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile, who has lineage, I might</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say no, </span>he is qualified. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only about <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, </span>I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <span class="gemarra-regular">because he has no connection to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>of the Torah; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, who does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have a connection to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>as he is obligated to keep the mitzvot that a woman is obligated to keep, <span class="gemarra-regular">I might say no, </span>he is qualified. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both exceptions.
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And women are included in the </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>in the same way as men. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where is this matter </span>derived?
The Gemara presents three sources for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says, and similarly, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states </span>with regard to the liability of one who takes a false oath that he had not stolen: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When a man or woman shall commit any of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sins </span>of a person” (Numbers 5:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse equates a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woman with a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punishments</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Torah.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Elazar taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The verse states with regard to the civil laws given following the revelation at Sinai: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And these are the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">civil laws that you shall set before them” </span>(Exodus 21:1). The reference to “them” in the verse is referring to all those who stood at the revelation, both men and women. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">equates a woman with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man with regard to all civil law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Ḥizkiyya and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states </span>with regard to liability in a case where one’s ox kills a person: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it killed a man or a woman”</span> (Exodus 21:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">equates a woman with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man with regard to all killing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Torah, </span>i.e., the liability incurred is the same whether the person killed was a man or a woman.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>all three sources <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary, as had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>source, one might have said that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>that men and women are equated, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Merciful One had pity upon </span>a woman and made her liable <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that she should achieve atonement </span>through paying restitution. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">civil law, </span>one might say that for <span class="gemarra-regular">a man, who is involved in business </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealings, yes, </span>the civil laws apply to him, but to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>who generally is not involved in business dealings, the laws do <span class="gemarra-regular">not apply.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only that men and women are equated in <span class="gemarra-regular">civil law, </span>one might have said that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that she should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">sustain </span>herself by engaging in business dealings. If civil laws did not apply to a woman, one would be wary about conducting business with her. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to obligating a woman to achieve <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>one might have said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who is obligated in mitzvot, yes, </span>he is similarly obligated to achieve atonement; but <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, who is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span>all the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>to the same extent as a man, no, the obligation does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply to her.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sources, one might have limited the fact that a woman and man are equated to these two cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">here due to </span>the fact that she also needs <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, and there due to </span>the fact that she needs to be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">sustain </span>herself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>one’s liability for his ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killing </span>a person, one might have said that only for killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a man, who is obligated in </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>yes, the owner of the ox is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ransom; </span>but for killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>who is not obligated in all mitzvot, one might say he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only the equivalence of a man and woman with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, </span>one might have thought that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is a very serious matter as <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a loss </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of life, but </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sources, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a loss of life, I would say no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a woman is not included. Accordingly, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to have all three sources.
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for the damage </span>are involved <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>made when one’s innocuous ox gores another’s animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> restitution </span>for the injured party’s loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine.</span>
The Gemara elucidates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The payment is <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds</span> that even <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary oxen, </span>which have not been forewarned with regard to Goring, are <span class="gemarra-regular">not presumed to be safeguarded, </span>as their nature does not prevent them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is responsible to safeguard them, to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">by right it </span>should have been <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the damage. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One had pity upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, as his ox had not yet been forewarned </span>and he was not fully aware of the possibility that it might gore, and accordingly, the Torah reduced the extent of his liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary oxen </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">presumed to be safeguarded, </span>as their nature prevents them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is not responsible for safeguarding them to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">by right </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>should have been <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at all. </span>Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One penalized him in order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he will safeguard his ox, </span>even before it is forewarned, and decreed that the fine should be given to the injured party even though he is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one liable for the damage </span>are involved <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this assumes that the injured party is theoretically entitled to receive the full value of his damaged animal but in practice receives only half. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the mishna means by saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that the injured </span>party is also <span class="gemarra-regular">involved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment, </span>because it is as though he is compelled to forgo half of the cost of the damage that by right he should be paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the</span> cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, </span>which assumes that the injured party is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that </span>even the money that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes is not his </span>by right, is it accurate to describe him <span class="gemarra-regular">as being </span>involved <span class="gemarra-regular">in the payment?</span>
The Gemara explains: The mishna’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only with regard to </span>the fact that the injured party is the one who absorbs the loss due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> between the animal’s death and the time that the case is brought before the court. Since he must absorb this financial loss, it may be said that he is involved in the payment.
The Gemara asks: How can one claim that the mishna is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass? Isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, which by using the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Payments </span>of restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage, teaches that the owner </span>of the injured animal <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., retains ownership of, <span class="gemarra-regular">the animal carcass? </span>And therefore it follows that he bears any depreciation in its value, as the Gemara (10b) explained above.
The Gemara explains why the mishna needs to teach this principle twice: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>mention is made <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is made <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">because if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it would teach us </span>the principle only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the liability of the owner of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it has not yet been forewarned. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>the Torah does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>limit the owner’s liability at all and the owner must also bear the loss due to the diminishing value of the carcass. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach us </span>the principle only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned</span> ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the owner’s liability <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is paying </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the damage, so the Torah does not overly burden him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, where he is liable for only half of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>the Torah does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>limit his liability any further, so he must bear the loss of the diminishing value of the carcass. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state the principle in both cases.
The Gemara attempts to prove whether the payment of half the cost of the damage is considered to be monetary restitution or a fine: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (16b): <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the liability incurred for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox? The difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>proceeds of the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body, and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality</span> property.
The Gemara explains the challenge posed by the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so, </span>that payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is considered a fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">also teach this </span>additional distinction: The owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay based</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his own </span>admission, in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one does not pay a fine based on one’s own admission, whereas the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> based on his own </span>admission.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> could have taught this distinction; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught </span>only certain distinctions <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> omitted </span>others, including this one. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">did he omit that he omitted this? </span>A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> would never omit just a single case, perforce there must be another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> he omitted.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He omitted </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that if an innoc-uous ox kills someone, its owner does not pay even <span class="gemarra-regular">half of the ransom </span>payment, whereas if the ox is forewarned, he pays the full ransom.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one claims that the mishna omits the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of one who admits his liability <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that it also omits the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the owner of an innocuous ox does not pay even <span class="gemarra-regular">half of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ransom, </span>that is a flawed claim, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not an omission, </span>because one could say: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says </span>that when <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox kills a person, one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the distinction between an innocuous and forewarned ox is included in the mishna’s ruling that the owner of an innocuous ox pays half the cost of the damage. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 41a): 

Daf 15b

If one admits: <span class="gemarra-regular">My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox killed so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>my ox killed <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so’s ox, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission.
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> innocuous ox? </span>If so, this mishna proves that one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage even based on one’s own admission, which demonstrates that the payment is monetary restitution and not a fine.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this explanation, if it had been an <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox that gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pay based on his own </span>admission? But <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rather than teaching </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna in <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span>: If one admits: <span class="gemarra-regular">My ox killed so-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so’s </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not pay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">differentiate and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach </span>the distinction <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the case raised in the first clause <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. </span>The reason for the distinction between the cases when one’s ox kills a Jew or a Canaanite slave is that in the first one pays monetary restitution, while in the second one pays a fine. If the mishna wishes to demonstrate the difference between a fine and monetary restitution with regard to admission, then instead of introducing a new case, the mishna would have modified the case of the previous clause.
The mishna would have continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>in the first clause <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an admission that one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay based on his own </span>admission. The fact that the mishna does not do so suggests that in fact one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage based on one’s own admission that his innocuous ox gored. Evidently, the payment is considered to be monetary restitution.
The Gemara rejects this: The reason the mishna did not raise the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned ox is not because that distinction is not a valid one, but because the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the concluding clause of the mishna just cited: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the principle: Anyone who pays more than </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he damaged does not pay based on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>admission. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not</span> that were he liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he damaged, he would pay </span>based on his own admission? Since when an innocuous ox gores, its owner is liable to pay more than the cost of the damage, the payment is clearly not monetary restitution; perforce it must be a fine, and therefore it is not payable based on one’s own admission.
The Gemara rejects the inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>one should infer only that were he liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">as much</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he damaged, he pays</span> based on his own admission. If the sum to be paid is more or less than the cost of that which he damaged, he would not pay based on his own admission.
The Gemara asks. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to that opinion, where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>than the cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would one say that, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>based on his own admission? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, instead of teaching: This is the principle: Anyone who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pays more than </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he damaged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: Anyone who does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not pay as much as </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he damaged </span>does not pay based on his own admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>that statement <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span>cases where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than the cost of that which he damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span>cases where one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>than the cost of that which he damaged. Evidently, the mishna holds that where one’s liability is for less than the cost of the damage, it is payable based on one’s own admission. This therefore provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is a fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara notes the obvious inconsistency: How can it be that the Gemara offers <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then state that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> is in accordance with that opinion?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> may be in accordance with that opinion because of the following resolution of the refutation. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the Gemara held that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach: </span>Anyone who does not pay <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he damaged </span>does not pay based on his own admission. This is not, in fact, a conclusive refutation, as even if one holds that the payment of half the cost of the damage for an innocuous ox is considered monetary restitution, one can still explain why the mishna doesn’t discuss cases where one is liable for less than the cost of the damage.
This is because the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot make </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an absolute </span>statement about such cases, that one never pays based on one’s own admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since there is </span>an obligation for one to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">pebble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">which, through tradition it is learne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>this payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is monetary restitution, </span>and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>cases where one’s liability is valued at less than the cost of the damage.
The Gemara considers the ramifications of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is a fine, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">dog that ate lamb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>this innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">cat that ate a chicken, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is atypica</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> behavior for dogs and chickens, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not collect </span>the payment for these acts in the courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since it is not common for these animals to eat those animals, these acts are classified as Goring, irrespective of the fact that the animal gained pleasure from the damage, for which it would normally be classified in the category of Eating. Therefore, in cases where these animals had not performed this act of damaging before, and were therefore considered innocuous, the owner is liable for only half the cost of the damage, which is a fine. Since the collection of fines may be imposed only by judges who have been ordained, and ordination is given only in Eretz Yisrael, these payments are not collected in Babylonia.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>they attacked <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>animals, as it is atypical behavior for them; <span class="gemarra-regular">but where </span>they attacked <span class="gemarra-regular">small</span> animals, since that <span class="gemarra-regular">is their </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of behavior, it is classified as Eating, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, which is certainly considered monetary restitution. Accordingly, the payment is collected by the courts in Babylonia.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even in a case where the payment is considered a fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">seize</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the property of the owner of the belligerent animal in order to cover his loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not reclaim </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from him </span>since he is entitled to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>also, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fix a time for m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to go to Eretz </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yisrael </span>to present the case before ordained judges, <span class="gemarra-regular">we fix </span>a time <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>and require the owner of the belligerent animal to go to the court in Eretz Yisrael at that time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not go, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excommunicate hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> for disobeying the orders of the court.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And either</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> way</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we excommunicat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the owner of the belligerent animal <span class="gemarra-regular">until he removes the danger</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., by killing the animal or otherwise neutralizing the danger.
The justification for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Natan, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not raise a vicious do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his house, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one may not set up an unstable ladder in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his house? The verse states: “You shall not bring blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into your house” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:8), i.e., one may not allow a hazardous situation or item to remain in one’s house. As long as the belligerent dog or cat is still alive, the owner is in violation of this verse and therefore the court may excommunicate him for failing to remove the danger.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that an animal can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> even when its owner was warned each time to prevent it from doing so. After the third time, the animal is rendered forewarned. In such cases, the owner is liable to pay only half of the damages. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five</span> damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>at times even if it had never caused damage in that manner. In such cases the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">An animal is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to Goring, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">not for goring </span>with its horns, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor for pushing </span>with its body, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">biting, nor for crouching </span>upon items in order to damage them, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor for kicking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In these cases the animal is considered to be innocuous and its owner is liable for only half of the damages.
Concerning acts of damage performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">the tooth, </span>the animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to eating that which is fitting for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to eat. Concerning acts of damage performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">the foot, </span>the animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breaking </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">while walking. And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which gored three times and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that causes damage </span>to the property of the injured party while <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured</span> party. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">the person, </span>i.e., any damage done by a person. In all of these cases the one who caused the damage is considered to be forewarned, resulting in the obligation to pay the full cost of the damage.
The mishna presents the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for wild animals: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf; the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bear; the leopard; the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the meaning of which the Gemara will discuss; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the snake.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> These are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>even if they had never previously caused damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: When these </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domesticate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. But the snake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is always </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in its latter clause: Concerning acts of damage performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tooth, </span>the animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to eating</span> that which is fitting for it to eat, we learn, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, that we are dealing </span>throughout the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>cases of damage done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> injured </span>party, as one is exempt from liability for acts of damage classified as Eating if they occur in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet the first clause <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: An</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animal is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to Goring. Stating that it is not forewarned indicates that the liability of its owner is limited only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to paying the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> full </span>cost <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half</span> the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>it that holds that when damage classified as Goring is done within the property of the injured party the owner of the belligerent animal is liable for only half of the damages? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who say: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>performed by an innocuous animal, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical </span>behavior, done <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard of the injured </span>party, is that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
But then <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>and try to explain accordingly, the next part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox </span>that gored three times, and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that causes damage</span> to the property of the injured party while <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property of the injured </span>party. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">the person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In these cases, the responsible party pays full damages. With this clause <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>performed by an innocuous animal, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical, </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard of the injured </span>party, is that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>even if the ox is innocuous.
The Gemara asks: Could it be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>part of the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis and </span>the next part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, as Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Yehuda: Large-toothed one, leave the mishna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and follow after me </span>and my interpretation that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>part of the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis and </span>the next part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon.</span>
The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav: </span>

Daf 16a

The <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon; the first </span>part of the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>which under the terms of their partnership is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them, </span>i.e., the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>keep his <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>keep their <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen </span>there. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>caused by one partner’s ox to the injured party’s produce in that courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>equivalent to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard </span>owned exclusively by <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party, and the ox’s owner is liable for all the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>damage of the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>since they are both allowed to keep oxen there, the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> equivalent to <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, </span>and if one’s innocuous ox causes damage there, one is liable for only half the cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: I stated this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>of Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Zevid of Neharde’a,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he said to me: Are you </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">able </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to interpret </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon? But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>Concerning acts of damage performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">the tooth, </span>the animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to eating that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is fitting for it </span>to eat. This indicates that only if what it eats <span class="gemarra-regular">is fitting for it, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one is liable for the full cost of the damage, but if it eats something <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not fitting for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>the owner would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable for the full cost of the damage, but only for half the cost of the damage.
Rav Kahana explains his difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, </span>the owner should be liable to pay the full cost of the damage even if his animal ate something not fitting for it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t </span>Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>performed by an innocuous animal, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical, </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party, is that the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>even if the ox is innocuous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Kahana said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually </span>it must be that the entire mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>The opening clause should be understood as saying: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, but if they were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">warned </span>for performing those acts three times, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the five </span>acts <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>i.e., the mishna is not referring to two different sets of damages, five acts for which the animal is considered innocuous and five for which it is considered forewarned. Rather, both statements in the initial clause of the mishna are referring to the same five acts of Goring, and they teach that although the animal is initially considered innocuous with regard to these five acts, it can become forewarned.
The next part of the mishna then provides another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for damage of the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, </span>an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the outset. </span>The next two items in the mishna: A forewarned ox and an ox that causes damage on the property of the injured party, should be understood as a question and an answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">their forewarned status </span>with regard to these acts apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> injured </span>party. According to Rav Kahana’s explanation, the statement: In the courtyard of the injured party, refers only to cases of Eating or Trampling, not to acts classified as Goring, and therefore it is true even according to the opinion of the Rabbis.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina objects to this</span> explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>(24b) <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>With regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that causes damage </span>to the property of the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party, stated in the mishna here (15b), <span class="gemarra-regular">how so, </span>i.e., what are the circumstances in which one is liable to pay the full cost of the damage? The mishna below (24b) proceeds to list acts of damage classified as Goring. Ravina states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the mishna here (15b) <span class="gemarra-regular">discusses that </span>case, i.e., that it is referring to Goring, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>ruling that the mishna below <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: How so, </span>and proceeds to discuss one’s liability for Goring, as it is elucidating the case mentioned in the mishna here. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say, </span>as Rav Zevid suggests, that the mishna here (15b) <span class="gemarra-regular">does not discuss </span>Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the mishna below when it asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How so, </span>and then proceeds to discuss one’s liability for Goring?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Ravina said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, but if they were warned </span>for performing those acts three times with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the five </span>acts, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned.</span>
The next part of the mishna then provides another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for damage of the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the outset, and this is</span> a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>there is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that causes damage </span>to the property of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party, which <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tarfon and the Rabbis. And there are other </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to these </span>in which animals are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the outset, namely: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf, the lion, the bear, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leopard, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the snake.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>interpretation of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, but if they were warned </span>for performing those acts three times with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the five </span>acts, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. </span>The next part of the mishna then provides another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for damage of the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outset, and this is </span>a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned ox. And</span> there is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that causes damage</span> to the property of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property of the injured </span>party, which <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis. And there are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to these </span>in which animals are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>from the outset, namely: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf, the lion, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bear, the leopard, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the snake.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who raise </span>this issue <span class="gemarra-regular">as a contradiction </span>and through doing so arrived at the same conclusions, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the opening clause of the mishna: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, and </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. </span>With regard to this, one can ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is there nothing else</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But aren’t there </span>the cases mentioned in the continuation of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf, the lion, the bear, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the leopard, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the snake? </span>These are considered to be forewarned even if they had never caused damage before.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the contradiction through that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, but if they were warned </span>for performing those acts three times with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the five </span>acts, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. </span>The next part of the mishna then provides another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for damage of the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>an animal is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the outset, and this is </span>a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned ox. And </span>there is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that causes damage </span>to the property of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, which <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are other </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to these </span>in which animals are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>from the outset, namely: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lion, the bear, the leopard, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">snake.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: An animal is not considered forewarned with regard to Goring, i.e., not for goring with its horns, nor for pushing with its body, nor for biting, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor for crouching </span>upon items in order to damage them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">large vessels, </span>as it is atypical for an animal to crouch upon them, and therefore the act is classified as a subcategory of Goring. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the animal cr0uched upon <span class="gemarra-regular">small vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since that <span class="gemarra-regular">is its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of behavior, it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, for which the animal is considered forewarned from the outset.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">An animal is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>from the outset, <span class="gemarra-regular">to walk in its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to break or crush a person, or an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or vessels. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that an animal’s typical manner is to crush vessels, presumably by crouching down upon them. This would seem to contradict the mishna that states that such behavior is atypical. It would appear the only resolution to this contradiction is if one accepts the distinction made by Rabbi Elazar that the mishna concerns large vessels and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns small vessels.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns a case where the animal pushed against the utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side </span>and crushed them against a wall, but it does not concern a case where it crouched upon them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of this discussion, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Do not say </span>that the mishna’s ruling refers only to <span class="gemarra-regular">large vessels, as it is atypical </span>for an animal to crouch upon them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the animal crouched upon <span class="gemarra-regular">small vessels, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>and for that type of damage the animal is considered forewarned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna refers <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">small vessels, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atypical </span>for an animal to crouch upon them.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: An animal is considered forewarned, from the outset, to walk in its typical manner and to break <span class="gemarra-regular">or crush a person, or an animal, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or vessels.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: Perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerns only a case where the animal pushed against the utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the side </span>and crushed them against a wall.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who raise </span>this issue <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction: We learned </span>in the mishna: An animal is not considered forewarned with regard to Goring, i.e., not for goring with its horns, nor for pushing with its body, nor for biting, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor for crouching </span>upon items in order to damage them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: An animal is considered forewarned, from the outset, to walk in its typical manner and to break <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crush a person, or an animal, or vessels? </span>In order to resolve this contradiction, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult; here, </span>in the mishna, the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">small vessels.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">The wolf, the lion, </span>the bear, the leopard, the <span class="it-text">bardelas</span>, and the snake; these are considered to be forewarned even if they had never caused damage before. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bardelas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nafreza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nafreza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Yosef said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">appa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In addition to the list of animals that are considered forewarned, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Also the hyena [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzavo’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elazar says: Also the snake. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said </span>in explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="gemarra-regular">hyena </span>mentioned by Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the animal called <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">appa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If Rav Yosef understands a hyena to be an <span class="it-text">appa</span>, how could he also claim, above, that it is a <span class="it-text">bardelas</span>?
The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Rabbi Meir is <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to a male hyena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the mishna, the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hyena.</span>
And it is apparent that a male hyena is distinct from a female one, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A male hyen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after seven year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> metamorphoses into an insectivorous bat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atalef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; an insectivorous bat after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven years metamorphoses into a herbivorous bat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arpad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> herbivorous bat after seven years metamorphoses into a thistle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kimosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; a thistle after seven years metamorphoses into a briar [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥo’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">a briar after seven years metamorphoses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into a demon. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person’s spine, seven years </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">metamorphoses into a snake. </span>The Gemara qualifies the last statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter applies </span>only to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">did not bow during </span>the blessing of <span class="gemarra-regular">thanksgiving</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the eighteenth blessing of the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says </span>above: In addition to the list of animals that are considered forewarned, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Also the hyena. </span>

Daf 16b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Also the snake. </span>By using the term also, Rabbi Elazar suggests he considers a snake to be forewarned to the same extent as the other animals in the mishna’s list, which, according to his opinion, are not considered to be forewarned if they are domesticated. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: When these </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are domesticated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, but the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">snake is always </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned?</span>
The Gemara answers: Emend and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as saying that Rabbi Elazar says: <span class="gemarra-regular">A snake, </span>instead of saying: Also a snake. Accordingly, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is teaching that he holds that only a snake is considered to be forewarned under all circumstances because he holds that even if it is domesticated it is still prone to caused damage.
§ The Gemara considers cases of damage caused by a lion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a lion </span>that kills an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it clawe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> its prey <span class="gemarra-regular">and ate </span>it, the lion’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. But if it first <span class="gemarra-regular">tore apart </span>its prey with its teeth in order to kill it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> only then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>it, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the damage.
The Gemara elucidates: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it clawed </span>its prey <span class="gemarra-regular">and ate </span>it, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since it is its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">claw </span>its prey and eat it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to </span>the case of an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that eats fruit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and vegetables </span>belonging to someone else. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain, and </span>the owner of the lion is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>But if the lion first <span class="gemarra-regular">tore apart </span>its prey to kill it, since this <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, </span>the act is classified as Goring, for which an owner is liable even in a public thoroughfare.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that tearing apart </span>its prey <span class="gemarra-regular">is not the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of </span>a lion? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“The lion tears apart for its young, </span>and it strangles for its lionesses, and it fills its caves with prey, and its den with that which was torn apart” (Nahum 2:13). The description in the verse clearly indicates that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart its prey. The Gemara answers that each phrase of this verse is referring not to a situation where the lion catches prey for its own immediate use, but to one where it provides food <span class="gemarra-regular">for its young, </span>as it says: “The lion tears apart for its young”; to provide food <span class="gemarra-regular">for its lionesses: “And it strangles for its lionesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; </span>to provide food <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the young cubs in <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lair: “And it filled its lair with prey”; </span>and to provide food <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the young cubs in <span class="gemarra-regular">its den: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And its den with that which was torn apart.” </span>Therefore, we cannot learn from this verse that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart prey for its own immediate use.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning acts classified as Eating: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wild</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animal, </span>including a lion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that entered the courtyard of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and tore apart </span>the courtyard owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">animal and ate </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">meat, </span>the owner of the wild animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it tore apart </span>the animal in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to leave it </span>for later consumption. Since this is typical behavior for a lion, the lion is considered forewarned with regard to it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>its meat? The Gemara answers: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the lion initially killed the animal to leave it for later consumption but then <span class="gemarra-regular">reconsidered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ate </span>it.
The Gemara questions this understanding: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know </span>what the animal’s initial intentions were? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if one accepts this claim, then the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>called into question, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the case he ruled on <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a case like <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>where the lion initially intended to leave the prey he killed for later consumption, and therefore the owner should be exempt. The Gemara therefore rejects this understanding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">disjunctively </span>and should be understood as teaching two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: With regard to a lion <span class="gemarra-regular">that tore apart </span>an animal in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to leave </span>it for later consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>a lion that <span class="gemarra-regular">clawed </span>its prey <span class="gemarra-regular">and ate </span>it, since each acted in the typical manner of a lion, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is the typical manner of a wild lion to kill its prey and then eat it, and therefore such damage is classified as Eating. Accordingly, if the damage was done in the public domain, the lion’s owner is exempt from any liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Shmuel says </span>that an owner is liable if his lion does so, that was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domesticated lion and in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar, who says it is not the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of a domesticated wild animal to attack. Accordingly, the act is classified as being of the category of Goring, for which one is liable even in a public thoroughfare.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when the lion <span class="gemarra-regular">clawed</span> its prey and ate it, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable</span> for any damage it causes in a public domain, since according to Rabbi Elazar such behavior is atypical for a domesticated lion. Why then does Shmuel rule that in such a case the owner is exempt?
The Gemara concedes that its presentation of Ravina’s opinion is untenable: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Ravina’s </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">was not stated in reference to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel’s </span>ruling, but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather in reference to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>cited above, that discusses a case where a lion causes damage in the courtyard of the injured party. Accordingly, Ravina’s statement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>that one is liable if one’s lion tore apart an animal and ate it, that was <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a domesticated lion and in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar, who says it is not the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of a domesticated wild animal to attack.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>since the act is atypical behavior for a lion, it should be classified as Goring, and the owner should be <span class="gemarra-regular">required to pay </span>for only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the lion <span class="gemarra-regular">was forewarned.</span>
The Gemara questions further: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, what </span>is the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches this among </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategories of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eating? It should have taught it among </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategories of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Goring. </span>The Gemara concedes: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>with this explanation.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous and </span>the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>differences are <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>proceeds of the sale <span class="gemarra-regular">of the body </span>of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">higher </span>property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the mishna mean by saying he pays from his <span class="gemarra-regular">higher</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aliyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>property? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>It means that he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">with the superior-quality [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bame’ulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>the fact that the word <span class="it-text">aliyya</span> is referring to superior-quality property is indicated by the verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And Hezekiah lay with his ancestors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they buried him in the best [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bema’ale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sepulchers of the descendants of David” </span>(II Chronicles 32:33), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar says: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-italic">bema’ale</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">beside the best of the family</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And who are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they? David and Solomon.</span>
The Gemara offers an interpretation of another verse about the burial of a king of Judea, King Asa: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hewn out for himself in the city of David, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laid him in the resting place, which was filled with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perfumes and spices [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zenim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> prepared by the perfumers’ art” (II Chronicles 16:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">“perfumes and spices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? Rabbi Elazar says: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zinei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of perfumes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The word <span class="it-text">zenim</span> sounds similar to the word <span class="it-text">zenut</span>, licentiousness, and should therefore be understood about types of <span class="gemarra-regular">perfumes that anyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who smells them is led to licentiousness.</span>
The Gemara cites another dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: Jeremiah requested of God to punish those who hounded him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For they have dug</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pit to trap me and they have set snares</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my feet” </span>(Jeremiah 18:22). In what way did they dig a pit to trap him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They cast suspicion upon him of </span>engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who had engaged in sexual intercourse with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man forbidden to her by the Torah [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: They cast suspicion upon him of </span>engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says that they cast </span><span class="gemarra-regular">suspicion upon him of </span>engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>because the word “pit” is used as a metaphor for a <span class="it-text">zona</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zona</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a deep pit” </span>(Proverbs 23:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says that they cast suspicion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon him </span>of engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman,</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason did Jeremiah use the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“pit”?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to </span>the fact that she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman, should she be excluded from the category</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If she commits adultery she is also termed a <span class="it-text">zona</span>, and the term “pit” can justifiably be applied to her.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him of </span>engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman, this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “You, Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, know all their plans to kill me” </span>(Jeremiah 18:23). By claiming he engaged in intercourse with a married woman, they implicated him in a prohibition punishable by the death penalty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">suspected him of </span>engaging in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what</span> did he mean by saying <span class="gemarra-regular">“to kill </span>me” when there is no court-imposed capital punishment for doing so? The Gemara answers: Jeremiah was referring to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they cast him into a pit of mire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>a verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Let them be made to stumble</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before You</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deal with them in the time of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Your anger” </span>(Jeremiah 18:23)? It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Universe, even at a time when they </span>try to <span class="gemarra-regular">perform</span> acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity, make them stumble </span>by ensuring that they do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are unworthy </span>of charity <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that they should not receive </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reward for </span>helping <span class="gemarra-regular">them.</span>
The Gemara, above, cited a verse concerning King Hezekiah’s burial. The Gemara cites the continuation of that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they afforded him hono</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his death” </span>(II Chronicles 32:33). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that they established a yeshiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at his grave </span>to study Torah there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis disagree </span>with regard to this yeshiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>They studied there for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>days. 

Daf 17a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: </span>They studied there for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven</span> days. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>they studied there for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty</span> days.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that offers another interpretation of the verse cited: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And afforded him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] honor in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his death” </span>(II Chronicles 32:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to the honor given to <span class="gemarra-regular">Hezekiah, king of Judea, that </span>at his burial <span class="gemarra-regular">36,000 </span>men with <span class="gemarra-regular">bared shoulder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> went out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before him. </span>They removed their robes from their shoulders as a sign of mourning. The number 36,000 is alluded to by the numerical value of the word <span class="it-text">lo</span>, which is thirty-six. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: But didn’t they </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">do this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Ahab? </span>Apparently, if they did this for the wicked king Ahab, it is an honor shown to all kings, and it is was not a unique show of honor for the righteous Hezekiah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the honor that was done for Hezekiah was <span class="gemarra-regular">that they laid a Torah scroll upon his bier</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they said: This one, </span>i.e., Hezekiah, <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which is written in this, </span>i.e., the Torah scroll.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But nowadays as well, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do this </span>for any great Torah scholar that dies, so what is unique about what was done to honor Hezekiah? The Gemara answers: Nowadays, <span class="gemarra-regular">we take </span>a Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not lay </span>it on the bier of the deceased. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that nowadays <span class="gemarra-regular">we also lay </span>a Torah scroll on the bier of the deceased; but <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say: </span>This one <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled</span> that which is written in this.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">walking together</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with Rabbi Yoḥanan to ask </span>him about this <span class="gemarra-regular">statement. Whenever</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he would enter a lavatory, </span>upon his exit <span class="gemarra-regular">I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ask him </span>to explain <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> answer us until he had washed his hands and donned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his phylacteries and made </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blessing, and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">then would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he answer us. </span>With regard to the honor given to King Hezekiah, he said: Nowadays, <span class="gemarra-regular">we even say: </span>This one <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>that which is written in this, but <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not say: He taught </span>that which is written in this, which was a unique honor performed at the burial of the righteous King Hezekiah.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t the Master say: Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study is grea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">study </span>of Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">leads to</span> one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">performanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the mitzvot? This indicates that the performance of mitzvot is considered of greater value than Torah study. If so, once Hezekiah had been praised with the fact that he fulfilled the mitzvot of the Torah, why mention that he studied it? The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>statement of the Master is <span class="gemarra-regular">about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> studyin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the Torah for one’s own knowledge, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>unique praise given to King Hezekiah was <span class="gemarra-regular">about teachin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the Torah to others.
§ A verse that was cited at the beginning of the this chapter (2b) as part of a halakhic exposition is now explained homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</span> is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Happy are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you that sow beside all waters, that send forth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of the ox and the donkey” </span>(Isaiah 32:20)? It teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever engages in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah and in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">acts of kindness merits</span> reward equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of two tribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Joseph and Issachar.
The Gemara explains how this is derived from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Happy are you that sow.” And </span>the reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">sowing </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">charity, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Sow for yourselves for charity, reap according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kindness” </span>(Hosea 10:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> to the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah, as it is stated </span>with regard to Torah study: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Ho, all who are thirsty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, go to water” </span>(Isaiah 55:1).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merits </span>reward equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of two tribes </span>is derived as follows: The reference to the ox in the verse is an allusion to Joseph, who is described as an ox (Deuteronomy 33:17), and one’s reward is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he merits to </span>receive <span class="gemarra-regular">a canopy </span>of honor, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vine, </span>a fruitful vine by a fountain; <span class="gemarra-regular">its branches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">run over the wall.” </span>The branches over the wall in this verse allude to the canopy. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reference to the donkey is an allusion to the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merits </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of Issachar, </span>who is described as a donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Issachar is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large-boned donkey” </span>(Genesis 49:14).
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span> that the comparison should be understood in a different manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">His enemies will fall before him </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>in the blessing given by Moses to the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the blessing bestowed by Moses to the tribe of Joseph: “His horns are the horns of the wild-ox; <span class="gemarra-regular">with them he shall gore the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nations, even to the ends of the earth” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And he merits the understanding of Issachar, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written:  “And of the children of Issachar, men that had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do” </span>(I Chronicles 12:33). 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna in the previous chapter (15b) teaches that the owner of an animal is always forewarned with regard to the category of Trampling. The mishna elaborates: For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>damage caused with <span class="gemarra-regular">the hoof </span>is the animal deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is deemed forewarned with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>trampling objects and <span class="gemarra-regular">breaking </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the course of its walking. An animal is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to walking in its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner and, </span>by doing so, <span class="gemarra-regular">breaking </span>objects as it proceeds.
By contrast, if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking </span>while it was walking, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it transpired <span class="gemarra-regular">that pebble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were </span>inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled from under its feet and </span>those pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">broke vessels,</span> cases of that kind do not fit precisely into the primary category of Trampling. In both of these cases the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">trod upon a vesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and broke it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then a shard of that vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">fell upon </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel and broke it, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the first </span>vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the latter </span>vessel, as the damage caused by the shard is tantamount to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Chickens are </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to walking in their </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner and breaking </span>objects, and therefore, the owner of a chicken pays the full restitution for the damage done to any objects broken by his chicken. If there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a string [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">delil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>a chicken’s <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>as an indication of ownership and it wrapped around a vessel and broke it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">was hopping </span>in an atypical manner <span class="gemarra-regular">and breaking vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 17b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rava: </span>In the context of the category of Trampling, damage caused by an animal trampling an object with its <span class="gemarra-regular">foot is the same as </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal</span> breaking an object with its body. Why does the mishna repeat the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> twice? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>First, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">primary categories </span>of damage, namely the category of Trampling with an animal’s foot, which is mentioned explicitly in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he teaches </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">subcategorie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of those primary categories, i.e., the animal is deemed forewarned with regard to causing damage with other parts of its body in the course of its walking.
Ravina challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, the latter clause </span>of the mishna (19b), <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches, </span>concerning the primary category of Eating: For what damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>is the animal deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned? </span>It is deemed forewarned with regard to eating food items fit for its consumption, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">the animal is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to eating fruits and vegetables. Ravina asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What primary categories and what subcategories are there </span>in that context? No subcategories of Eating are enumerated there, and nevertheless, the phrase: The animal is deemed forewarned, is repeated. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">responded to </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">with a humorous </span>response <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: I resolved </span>the difficulty in <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> mishna, now <span class="gemarra-regular">you resolve </span>the difficulty in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>for the apparent redundancy in the mishna with regard to Eating? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>First the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating by an undomesticated animal and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating by a domesticated animal. </span>And it was necessary to state both, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it enters your mind to say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And he set his animal loose” </span>(Exodus 22:4), with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">domesticated animals, yes, </span>the primary category of Eating applies, but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">undomesticated animals, no, </span>the primary category of Eating does not apply. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that undomesticated animals </span>are included <span class="gemarra-regular">in the category of domesticated animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in this regard and the owner of an undomesticated animal is liable for damage caused by his animal eating another person’s produce.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a domesticated animal <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>and only afterward taught the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an undomesticated animal, as the latter is included in the category of the former. The Gemara answers: On the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is derived from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an interpretation, is dear to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> preferred to begin with the derived <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and only then proceed to the explicit <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause, </span>in this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">too, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach that which is not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">written first, </span>as that which is derived from an interpretation is dear to him. The Gemara distinguishes between the cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>with regard to Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>damage caused by a domesticated animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>damage caused by an undomesticated animal <span class="gemarra-regular">are primary categories </span>of damage; therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> taught first <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is derived</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from an interpretation, is dear to him. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to Trampling, would <span class="gemarra-regular">he leave aside the primary category </span>of Trampling, done with the animal’s foot, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach a subcategory </span>first?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead that the reason that in this mishna the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> begins with that which is written explicitly in the Torah and only then proceeds to teach that which is derived through an interpretation is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">concluded </span>the discussion in the final mishna in the previous chapter (15b) <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling </span>by teaching the clause: The foot of an animal is deemed forewarned with regard to trampling objects and breaking them in the course of its walking, therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he began </span>the first mishna in the second chapter <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the primary category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: An animal is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to walking in its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner and, </span>while doing so, <span class="gemarra-regular">breaking </span>objects in the course of its walking. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal entered into the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and it damaged </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">with its body </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the course of its walking; or </span>if it caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hair </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the course of its walking; or with the saddle that is on it; or with the </span>packed <span class="gemarra-regular">saddlebag [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shalif </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is on it; or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the halter in its mouth; or with the bell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> around its neck; or </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with its burden; </span>in all these cases the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>propelled by an animal in the course of its walking, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pig that was burrowing in the garbage hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and caused damage, </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: If a pig <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that its owner must pay the full cost of the damage. What novel element is Sumakhos introducing? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">it propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pebbles, who mentioned anything about it? </span>The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>For damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by pebbles </span>that were propelled by animals walking <span class="gemarra-regular">in their typical manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a pig that was burrowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the garbage heap and propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged </span>an object, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. Sumakhos says:</span> Both in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>that were propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pig that was burrowing in the garbage heap and propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">and damaged </span>an object, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Sumakhos does not accept the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the owner pays only half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal in the course of its walking, i.e., in its typical manner. He holds that since the damage results from the animal’s typical behavior, the owner pays the full cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:1): If <span class="gemarra-regular">chickens were flying from place to plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and broke vessels with their wings, </span>their owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>as this is a subcategory of Trampling. By contrast, if the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by the wind </span>generated <span class="gemarra-regular">by their wings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of pebbles. <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos says: </span>The owner pays <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">chickens were hoppin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon dough or upon produce and they sullied </span>it with their feet, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they pecked </span>at it and caused damage, their owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. If </span>in the course of their hopping <span class="gemarra-regular">they stirred up dus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. Sumakhos says: </span>He pays <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken was flying from place to place and wind emerged from beneath its wings and </span>the wind <span class="gemarra-regular">caused vessels to break, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>The Gemara notes: This <span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Sumakhos and hold that the owner pays half the cost of the damage in these cases, just as he does in the case of pebbles propelled by the feet of an animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>analyzed the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Granted, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos </span>is understood, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that the status of damage resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by the animal’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of damage directly caused by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>and therefore the owner pays the full cost of the damage in both cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>they hold that the status of damage resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by the animal’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of damage directly caused by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself,</span> the owner should <span class="gemarra-regular">be required to pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And if </span>they hold that the status of damage resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>generated by the animal’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is not like </span>that of damage directly caused by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>and is not attributed to the animal, then the owner should not be required <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay even half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Then Rava said: Actually, </span>the Rabbis hold that the status of damage resulting from a force generated by the animal’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of damage directly caused by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>and in principle the owner should be required to pay the full cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the liability to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>is because the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through tradition, </span>and it does not correspond to the standard <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damages.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>type of action <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">za</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> interacts with a vessel in that manner, he renders it <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, </span>if the same type of action was done by an animal, resulting <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage, </span>the owner of the animal is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Conversely, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>type of action <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span> interacts with a vessel in that manner, he leaves it <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure, </span>e.g., where the contact is indirect, if the same type of action was done by an animal, resulting <span class="gemarra-regular">in damage, </span>the owner of the animal is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava, did he come to teach us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles? </span>The substance of Rava’s statement is that for damage caused by the indirect action of an animal, its owner pays half the cost of the damage. That is identical to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of pebbles articulated in the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> cited earlier. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, Rava teaches us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf pulling a cart [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Just as with regard to a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, the status of a vessel that a <span class="it-text">zav</span> moves is like that of a vessel with which he came into contact, so too, the status of damage caused by the cart pulled by the animal is like that of damage caused by the animal’s body, and it is not considered indirect damage like in the case of pebbles.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava: An animal is</span> deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to breaking </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">in the course of its walking. How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal entered into the courtyard of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it damaged </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">with its body </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the course of its walking; or with its hair </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the course of its walking; or with the saddle that is on it; or with the </span>packed <span class="gemarra-regular">saddlebag that is on it; or with the halter that is in its mouth; or with the bell that is around its neck; or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">with its burden; or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf </span>caused damage while <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling a cart; </span>in all these cases the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">chickens were pecking at the rope </span>tied to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bucket and the rope was severed and the bucket </span>fell and <span class="gemarra-regular">broke, </span>their owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">trod upon a vessel but did not break i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the vessel then <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled to another place and broke </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rava elaborates: In determining one’s liability for causing damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we follow the initial </span>action that ultimately led to the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>case is regarded as damage caused by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself? </span>Accordingly, the owner would pay the full cost of the damage as he would in any case classified under the primary category of Trampling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the breaking of the vessel and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case is regarded as similar to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>propelled by the foot of an animal in the course of its walking, since the vessel was not broken by a direct action of the animal, but rather, as an indirect result of the animal’s action?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Resolve </span>Rava’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba, as Rabba says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">threw a vessel from a roo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and another came and broke it with a stick </span>as it was falling, the one who hit it with the stick is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from all liability <span class="gemarra-regular">as we say to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he broke a broken vessel. </span>From the moment the vessel was tossed from the roof it was inevitable that it would break. Consequently, breaking it with a stick as it was falling had no real effect. Apparently, the initial action is the decisive factor in determining liability for damages. The same should be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where a vessel was trod upon by an animal but it did not break, and the vessel then rolled to another place and broke there. The liability should be determined based on the initial action that caused the damage. The Gemara rejects this proof: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is clear to Rabba, </span>who ruled as he did, but it remains <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma to Rava. </span>One cannot prove the opinion of one <span class="it-text">amora</span> from the opinion of another.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the resolution of this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping, </span>a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. And some say that it is forewarned.</span>
The Gemara questions the formulation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping? </span>Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the chicken was <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping and </span>the hopping <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>the vessel to roll to another place, and the vessel was broken there? <span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree with regard to this: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the initial </span>action that ultimately led to the damage, and since hopping is typical manner of movement for a chicken, its owner is responsible for any damage that resulted from its hopping. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds: We follow the breaking of the vessel, </span>and since there was an additional factor that broke the vessel, the owner of the chicken is not liable.
The Gemara rejects the parallel between the dispute and the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained differently. 

Daf 18a

The dispute concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled pebbles </span>from underfoot as it was hopping, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute of Sumakhos and the Rabbis, </span>cited earlier, that the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree. </span>One <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that the owner pays the full cost of the damage for pebbles propelled by an animal in the course of its walking, and the other <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that its owner pays half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an additional attempt to resolve the dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">chickens were pecking at the rope </span>tied to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bucke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the rope was severed and the bucket </span>fell and <span class="gemarra-regular">broke, </span>the owner of the chickens <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the initial </span>action that ultimately led to the damage in determining liability for damage. The Gemara rejects this conclusion, and one cannot adduce proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Interpret </span>instead that the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rope, </span>while the owner pays only half the cost of the damage for breaking the bucket.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope atypical </span>behavior for a chicken, and therefore it should be classified within the primary category of Goring, not the primary category of Eating? Why then must the owner of the chicken pay the full cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the rope <span class="gemarra-regular">was filthy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with kneaded dough, </span>and in those circumstances it is typical for a chicken to peck at it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: And the <span class="gemarra-regular">bucket broke, </span>indicating that the dispute is with regard to damage done to the bucket, not to the rope? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>propelled by an animal, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a shard was propelled from </span>the bucket broken by a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">and it fell upon another vessel and broke it, </span>the owner of the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the first </span>vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the second </span>one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is he of </span>the opinion that one pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span> caused by pebbles?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difference, according to Sumakhos, between damage </span>resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> force </span>generated by the animal’s action, e.g., pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action, e.g., damage caused by the shard of the bucket, and in the latter case Sumakhos concedes that the owner pays half the cost of the damage, that would result in a difficulty. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what of <span class="gemarra-regular">this dilemma raised by Rav Ashi: According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, </span>what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action, in which case the owner is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is its status <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> action?
Why did Rav Ashi state his dilemma; why did he not <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma and conclude that according to Sumakhos its status is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action? Since Rav Ashi does not resolve the dilemma based on this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, apparently, Sumakhos does not distinguish between the two types of force.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that we follow the initial </span>action that ultimately led to the damage when determining one’s liability for the damage. Therefore, an owner is liable for any damage resulting from his animal’s typical behavior, and he pays the full cost of the damage done to the bucket even if the damage took place in another location.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: </span>There is no proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as it could be explained that the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bucket is <span class="gemarra-regular">continually </span>propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the impetus of the chicken, who caused the bucket to break. That is why the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the owner of the chicken pays the full cost of the damage. The dilemma with regard to the case where an animal treads upon a vessel that rolls away and breaks elsewhere remains unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to one’s liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, does the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of the animal, just as one pays half the cost of the damage caused by an innocuous ox with regard to damage categorized under the primary category of Goring? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>land, as he does for other forms of damage? The Gemara elaborates: Does he <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we do not find </span>any case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>land? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he pays </span>restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>land, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we do not find </span>any case where an animal causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his animal?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping, </span>a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forewarned. </span>The Gemara questions the formulation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping? </span>Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the chicken was <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping and propelled </span>pebbles that caused the damage?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that they disagree: The one who says </span>that the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned holds that </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of the animal, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when an innocuous animal gores, while <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarned holds that he pays</span> restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>land, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when a forewarned animal causes damage. According to this analysis, Rava’s dilemma is the subject of a tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps the dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the Rabbis </span>with regard to the legal status of damage caused by a force generated by the animal’s action. It is with regard to the similarity of damage caused by an action performed by an animal’s body to the case where the chicken was hopping and propelled pebbles that caused the damage that the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of this dilemma from a mishna (21b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the dog took a loa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that was baking on hot coals <span class="gemarra-regular">and went to a stack of grain </span>to eat the loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">ate the loaf and ignited the stack </span>of grain with one of the coals attached to the loaf, the owner of the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for </span>the damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">the loaf, </span>as it is classified in the primary category of Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for </span>the damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">the stack </span>of grain. Rabbi Elazar says: He pays the full cost of the damage for the damage to the stack of grain as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that the owner pays half the cost of the damage caused to the stack of grain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>analogous to propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>as the coal fell from the loaf held in its mouth and ignited the grain? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in that regard </span>that when the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> said that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>he pays restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>proceeds of the sale of the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his animal. Apparently, half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles is paid from the body of the animal that caused the damage.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And can you understand </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in that way? According to that understanding, with regard to Rabbi Elazar, who disagrees with the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and holds that the owner of the dog pays the full cost of the damage caused to the grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we find </span>anywhere that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Elazar </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>proceeds of the sale of the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his animal?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">acted atypically with this coa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> with which he lit the stack of grain. Since the dog’s behavior was atypical, the damage is classified under the primary category of Goring, not under the category of Eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, who says </span>in a mishna (24b): The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">is atypical, </span>as there, the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>in contrast to half the cost of the damage that he pays when it transpires in the public domain. Nevertheless, since it was an innocuous animal that caused the damage, restitution is paid from its body.
The Gemara rejects that explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you interpreted </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the difficulty presented by the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>exclusively from proceeds of the sale of the body of the animal, which would not be so according to Rabbi Elazar.
The Gemara suggests: There is an alternative explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, who says </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, and </span>he also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>with regard to a forewarned ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">The aspect of innocuousness, </span>which dictates that the owner pays half the cost of the damage from the body of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">remains intact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to Rabbi Yehuda, the owner of a forewarned ox pays half the cost of the damage from the body of his ox and half the cost of the damage from his superior<span class="gemarra-regular">-</span>quality land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the owner pays restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">from the body </span>of his animal, the reference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the aspect of innocuousness, </span>i.e., half the cost of the damage. He pays the other half from his superior<span class="gemarra-regular">-</span>quality land as he would in the case of any forewarned animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Samma, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina: Say that you heard </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>stated that the aspect of innocuousness remains intact <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage categorized under the primary category of Goring, where the ox was initially <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became forewarned. In </span>the case of propelled pebbles, which is a subcategory of Trampling, where the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned from the outset, </span>

Daf 18b

<span class="gemarra-regular">did you hear hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> distinguish between the different parts of the payment? There is no aspect of innocuousness in the case of pebbles.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, when Rabbi Elazar says </span>that the owner of the dog pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>in a case that is similar to one of propelled pebbles, he was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was forewarned </span>with regard to this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree about this </span>point: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is forewarning with regard to </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles; </span>therefore, if there was testimony given in court that a particular animal regularly propels pebbles in the course of its walking, the animal is deemed forewarned and its owner pays the full cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no forewarning with regard to pebbles.</span> Apparently, payment for damage caused by pebbles is paid from the body of the animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if this is the case, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the dilemma raised by Rava </span>concerning whether there <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles or there is no forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>can be resolved from this dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the dilemma is raised <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles. If </span>the dilemma is raised <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Elazar, there is forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles.</span>
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: When I raise the dilemma, </span>I do so specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos </span>and hold that one pays half the cost of the damage in the case of pebbles; <span class="gemarra-regular">but here </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">both the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, who says that </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, one pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say </span>that one pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage </span>in the case of pebbles? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in the case of pebbles the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">acted atypically and was not forewarned. And </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, concerning the dog that lit the stack of grain, the dispute between the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Elazar is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of damage caused by an innocuous ox on the property of the injured party.
The Gemara rejects the parallel between the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and the opinion of Rabbi Tarfon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Tarfon </span>the owner pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did you hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>Rabbi Tarfon restitution is paid only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the body </span>of the animal that caused the damage?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>Rabbi Tarfon holds that restitution is paid only from the body of the animal that caused the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where does </span>Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that when damage is caused by an innocuous ox on the property of the injured party its owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage and not merely half? He derives it via an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>that is caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>as explained in the mishna (24b).
His ruling is based on the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source, </span>i.e., a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference cannot be more stringent than the source of that derivation. Since restitution for damage categorized as Goring that is caused in the public domain is paid only from the body of the damaging animal, the same is true with regard to restitution for damage categorized as Goring that is caused on the property of the injured party.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>it clear from that mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon does not accept </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source, as, if he accepted that principle, not only would he hold that payment is only from the body of the animal, he would also require payment of half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara answers: He does not reject the principle. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he does not accept </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source, it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the result of rejecting the principle is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference is refuted. </span>But in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the result of rejecting the principle is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference is not refuted, </span>but will be applied in a more limited fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">he accepts </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source. Therefore, in this case the payment of the full cost of the damage, which is derived by means of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference, is paid only from the body of the animal based on the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source.
§ The Gemara discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>cited earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: Is there forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the owner would pay the full cost of the damage if he had been fore-warned three times, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is there no forewarning for </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>and he will always pay half the cost of the damage? The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we liken </span>the case of propelled pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring? </span>Accordingly, when an innocuous ox causes damage by propelling pebbles its owner pays half the cost of the damage, and when a forewarned ox does so the owner pays the full cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a subcategory </span>of the primary category <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling, </span>which is deemed forewarned from the outset? Accordingly, the owner would always pay half the cost of the damage, as there is no change in status after the third warning.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the resolution of this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping, </span>a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. And some say that it is forewarned. </span>The Gemara questions the formulation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping? </span>Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the chicken was <span class="gemarra-regular">hopping and propelled </span>pebbles that caused damage?
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the chicken has <span class="gemarra-regular">done </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">three times? And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds: There is forewarning for </span>pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds: There is no forewarning for </span>pebbles. According to this analysis, Rava’s dilemma is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. The Gemara rejects this resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the chicken hopped only <span class="gemarra-regular">one time. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos and the Rabbis, </span>concerning the compensation for damage caused by pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the resolution to the dilemma from an amoraic dispute: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal dropped excremen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onto doug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and damaged it, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>The owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and Rabbi Elazar says: </span>He pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal has <span class="gemarra-regular">done </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">three times? And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, </span>as one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds: There is forewarning for </span>pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds: There is no forewarning for </span>pebbles.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the animal dropped excrement only <span class="gemarra-regular">one time. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos and the Rabbis, </span>concerning compensation for damage caused by pebbles. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical </span>behavior of the animal, and since all behavior that deviates from the norm is classified within the category of Goring, the owner should be liable to pay only half the cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was force</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> into a narrow place and had no alternative to relieving itself onto the dough; therefore, it does not constitute atypical behavior.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the amoraic dispute parallels the tannaitic dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">let Rav Yehuda say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, and let Rabbi Elazar say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>instead of stating their dispute in the context of the particular case of the animal and the dough. The Gemara answers: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for them to state their dispute in this case, as there is a novel element concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement. It </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say: Since </span>the excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">is drawn after </span>the body of the animal, its legal status is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">its body, </span>not like pebbles propelled by the animal. Therefore, their stating the dispute with regard to excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that its status is like that of propelling pebbles. Therefore, the dispute between Rav Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar can be explained as parallel to the dispute between Sumakhos and the Rabbis with regard to pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>resolution to the dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rooster that extended its head into the airspace</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a glass vessel and crowe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">and broke it </span>with the sound waves, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And Rav Yosef said </span>that the Sages from <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a horse neighed or a donkey brayed and </span>the sound waves <span class="gemarra-regular">broke vessels, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>These are cases similar to the case of pebbles, and there is a dispute between the Sages with regard to these cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the rooster or animal has <span class="gemarra-regular">done </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">three times? </span>

Daf 19a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree:</span> One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited by Rami bar Yeḥezkel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: There is forewarning </span>for pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: There is no forewarning </span>for pebbles.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps the reference in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to a case where the rooster or animal damaged the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">one time. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos and the Rabbis, </span>concerning compensation for damage caused by pebbles. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">atypical</span> behavior for an animal to insert its head into a glass vessel, and isn’t all atypical behavior classified within the category of Goring, meaning that the owner should be liable to pay only half the cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The case is one where <span class="gemarra-regular">there were seeds in </span>the vessel, and therefore the rooster extending its head into the vessel is considered typical behavior.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises a dilemma: Is there </span>any halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>and therefore if an animal propelled pebbles in an atypical manner its owner is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of the damage, </span>i.e., half the restitution for damage caused by pebbles? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, is there no </span>halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>propelling <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles, </span>resulting in its owner being liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of the damage,</span> and therefore, even in an atypical case, the owner pays the standard restitution of half the cost of the damage?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Resolve </span>Rav Ashi’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from Rava’s </span>dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava raises a dilemma: Is there forewarning for pebbles, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or is there no forewarning for pebbles? </span>Based on that dilemma, one may conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there is no </span>halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior with regard to pebbles propelled by an animal, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage, as, were that the case, forewarning would lead to an animal owner’s liability to pay half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rava stated </span>his dilemma employing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say. If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior with regard to propelling pebbles, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage, and the owner pays half the cost of the damage in every case, <span class="gemarra-regular">is there forewarning for </span>pebbles, meaning that after three incidents the owner pays the full cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is there no forewarning for </span>pebbles? According to that understanding, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to Rav Ashi’s dilemma cannot be inferred from Rava’s dilemma. Rav Ashi’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>with regard to pebbles: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, </span>that one pays the full cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action, in which case the owner is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is its status <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action?
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did </span>Sumakhos <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one pays half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles as <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition </span>transmitted to Moses at Sinai, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he interprets </span>that tradition as applying in a case where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force</span> generated by the action of an animal? By contrast, in a typical case of damage caused by pebbles, which is an example of a force generated by the action of an animal, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, as it is a subcategory of Trampling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he did not learn </span>any <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition </span>in this regard <span class="gemarra-regular">at all, </span>and therefore even in a case where the damage was caused by a force generated by a force generated by the action of an animal, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, as it is a subcategory of Trampling. The Gemara concludes: This dilemma, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking </span>while it was walking, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">that pebbles were </span>inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled from under its feet and </span>those pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">broke vessels, </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking?</span>
The Gemara elaborates: Is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> saying that if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking and caused damage </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">with its kick, </span>which is a subcategory of Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the animal was walking and propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles in its typical manner, </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and, </span>accordingly, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>who hold that one pays half the cost of damage caused by pebbles? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is saying: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking and caused damage </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">with its kick, or </span>if the animal propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles due to its kick </span>and the pebbles caused damage, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>Accordingly, one may infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the animal propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles </span>as it was walking <span class="gemarra-regular">in its typical manner, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and </span>if so, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">trod upon a vessel and broke it and </span>then a shard of that vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">fell upon </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel and broke it, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the first </span>vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the latter </span>vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, does he hold </span>that one pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused by pebbles?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Sumakhos, and can be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span>vessel, concerning which the owner of the animal pays the full cost of the damage, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>vessel damaged following the <span class="gemarra-regular">propellin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of shards from the vessel upon which the animal trod, i.e., the second vessel that was broken. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the second </span>vessel, concerning which the owner of the animal pays half the cost of the damage, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>vessel following the <span class="gemarra-regular">propelling </span>of shards from the vessel upon which the animal trod, i.e., the third vessel that was broken by shards from the second vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason for the difference in liability is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a difference, according to Sumakhos, between </span>damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by the action of an animal, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, and damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action, for which he pays for only half the cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one were to say this explanation, what can be said of <span class="gemarra-regular">that dilemma which Rav Ashi raised: According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos, </span>that one pays the full cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action, in which case the owner is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is its status <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action? Why does he have a dilemma? Let him <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>from here <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>its status is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span>that of damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a force </span>generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action.
The Gemara answers: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi interprets </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>that one pays half the cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">raises this dilemma: </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking and caused damage </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">with its kick, </span>which is a subcategory of Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the animal was walking and propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles in its typical manner, </span>the owner of the animal pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>Accordingly, one may infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the pebbles were propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a kick, </span>the owner pays <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of the damage. And there is </span>halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior with regard to a case of pebbles, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is saying: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was kicking and caused damage </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">with its kick or </span>if the animal propelled <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles due to its kic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> and the pebbles caused damage, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. And there is no </span>halakhic significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">deviation </span>from typical behavior with regard to a case of pebbles. The Gemara concludes: Rav Ashi’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami, and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was walking in a place where it is impossible for it </span>to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">without propelling </span>pebbles as it proceeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it kicked and propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">and caused damage, what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara elaborates: Does one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is impossible for it</span> to walk without propelling pebbles, propelling pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">is its typical manner </span>in that situation and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case would be the same as any case of pebbles? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any event, the pebbles were propelled due to a kick</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is different. The Gemara concludes: Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira: </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was walking in the public domain and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">kicked and propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">and caused damage, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we liken </span>the damage in this instance <span class="gemarra-regular">to Goring, </span>since the action was performed with intent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>even though the incident transpired in the public domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>since this is a case of pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a subcategory of Trampling and </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability in the public domain. Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It stands to reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a subcategory of Trampling.</span>
Rabbi Yirmeya continued and asked Rabbi Zeira another question: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and caused damage on private property, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him, </span>employing terminology from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat: If <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is there </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing here? </span>Since the animal propelled the pebbles in the public domain, the owner is exempt from liability for any damage that it causes. The fact that the damage occurred on private property is not relevant.
Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rabbi Zeira’s first statement, that one is exempt from liability for one’s animal propelling pebbles in the public domain because it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was walking along the way and it propelled </span>pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay damages. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>a case where the pebbles were <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled in the public domain and caused damage in the public domain? </span>Rabbi Zeira replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the reference is to a case where the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>the pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and caused damage on private property. </span>Rabbi Yirmeya asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t you say:</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting here, is there </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing here? </span>Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I retrac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> my previous statement, as there is proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that there is liability in that case.
Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rabbi Zeira’s first statement from the mishna: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">trod upon a vessel and broke it and </span>then a shard of that vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">fell upon </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel and broke it, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the first </span>vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the latter </span>vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said in a case where the incident transpired <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>private <span class="gemarra-regular">property of the injured </span>party; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it transpired <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>the owner of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>vessel, as it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>the damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not</span> that the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>the pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and it caused damage in the public domain, </span>indicating that one does not pay for damage caused by pebbles in the public domain?
Rabbi Zeira replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps the reference in the mishna is to a case where the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>the pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and it caused damage on private property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Yirmeya said: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t you say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting here, is there </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing here? </span>Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I retract </span>my previous statement.
Rabbi Yirmeya raises an additional objection to Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span>Is the owner of the animal exempt from liability for pebbles propelled by his animal in the public domain? 

Daf 19b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>Payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is not differentiated </span>between private and public domains, as there is no exemption from payment <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>for damage <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property nor </span>for damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain? What, is </span>this principle <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated even in a case where the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and caused damage in the public domain? </span>Rabbi Zeira said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan stated this principle in a case where the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">propelled </span>pebbles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and caused damage on private property.</span>
Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t you say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting here, is there </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing here? </span>Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I retract </span>my previous statement. Or, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that payment of half the cost of the damage is not differentiated between private and public domains, and there is no exemption from payment neither for damage on private property nor for damage in the public domain, he said it only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>but not with regard to the case of propelled pebbles, for which one is exempt in the public domain.
§ The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda Nesi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Oshay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sat in the antechamber [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aki</span><span class="gemarra-italic">l’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yehuda </span>Nesia. <span class="gemarra-regular">A matter emerged from among them </span>and one of them raised a dilemma: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">swung its tail </span>and thereby caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The other </span>Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Must </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">grasp its tail and walk </span>to prevent the animal from causing damage? Since this is typical behavior for the animal, the owner should be exempt from liability. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, with regard to </span>damage in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, too, let us say: Must </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">grasp its horn and walk </span>to prevent the animal from causing damage? Nevertheless, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the owner is liable for damage in the category of Goring.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span>Damage in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring is not </span>caused in the course of the <span class="gemarra-regular">typical </span>behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the animal. Consequently, the owner is required to prevent his animal from causing damage in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>damage caused by the swinging of an animal’s tail is caused in the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its typical </span>behavior, and therefore the owner is required to prevent his animal from causing damage in that manner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since that is its typical behavior, what is the dilemma </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he raised? </span>Obviously one has no liability for the damage caused by the typical behavior of his animal in the public domain. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He raised a dilemma </span>with regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">excessive </span>tail <span class="gemarra-regular">swinging</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> is excessive tail swinging considered typical behavior?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Eina raises a dilemma: </span>If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">swung its peni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say just as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to Goring: Is it not </span>so in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>that the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination overcame it </span>and caused it to gore? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, it is no different: </span>The animal’s inclination overcame it and that is why it caused damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the cases are different, as in the case of damage in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">objective </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action <span class="gemarra-regular">is to cause damage, </span>whereas in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case the <span class="gemarra-regular">objective </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>action <span class="gemarra-regular">is not to cause damage. </span>The Gemara concludes: This dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Chickens are </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to walking in their </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner and breaking </span>objects. If there was a string tied to a chicken’s leg and it broke a vessel, or if the chicken was hopping in an atypical manner and breaking vessels, its owner pays half the cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: They taught </span>that one pays half the cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the string <span class="gemarra-regular">was tied </span>to the leg of the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a string became entangled on the leg of a chicken without the involvement of the owner and an item was broken by the string; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if a person tied </span>the string to the chicken, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of the damage, as the string is in the category of Pit.
The Gemara asks: If the string <span class="gemarra-regular">was tied on its own, who is liable </span>to pay half the cost of the damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the string </span>who pays, as the damage was caused by the string, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances? If </span>it is a case where the owner of the string <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed </span>the string in a secure place and the chicken became entangled in it, the owner of the string <span class="gemarra-regular">is a victim of circumstances beyond his control </span>and would be exempt from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he did not conceal it </span>and instead left it exposed where it could become entangled in the feet of a passing chicken, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is negligent </span>and liable as though he actually tied the string to the chicken.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case in the mishna is one where the owner of the string concealed it and is exempt from liability, and Rav Huna means that the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the chicken </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Here too, the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in this case where one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>obligated to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, as it is written </span>(Exodus 21:33): <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man shall open a pit, </span>or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein,” he pays the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> written: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>shall open <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit. </span>This indicates that if an ox opens a pit, the owner of the ox is exempt from liability. With regard to the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage as well, </span>the owner should be exempt from liability, as it is written: “If <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span>shall open <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit,” and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>written: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>shall open <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is one where the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">moved </span>the string and thereby caused damage. Since the chicken did not cause damage with its body, the owner pays half the cost of the damage, as he does in a case of pebbles. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when Rav Huna’s </span>distinction between whether the string was tied on its own or by a person <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, it was stated in a general </span>sense, and not with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ownerless string </span>tied to the leg of a chicken, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>If the string <span class="gemarra-regular">was tied </span>to the leg of the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own, </span>the owner of the chicken is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt; but if a person tied </span>the string to the chicken, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to what </span>primary category of damage is he <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ says: </span>He is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that although the string is not stationary, as in the standard obstacle in the primary category of Pit, this is an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">his pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is rolle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the feet of a person and at the hooves of an animal, </span>and that too is a subcategory of Pit.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Within the context of the primary category of Eating, for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>damage caused with <span class="gemarra-regular">the tooth </span>is an animal deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned? </span>It is deemed forewarned with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to eating </span>food items <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for its </span>consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">The domesticated animal is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to eating fruits and vegetables. </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or vessels, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>As these are not items fit for its consumption, the animal is not deemed forewarned in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>applied, that one pays the full value of the food eaten by the animal? It is a case where the animal ate the food <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the animal ate food <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>the owner of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even if the animal ate food in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derives benefit </span>from eating another’s produce in the public domain, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that it derives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> just not for the full cost of the food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Under what </span>circumstances does the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that it derives? </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the public <span class="gemarra-regular">square </span>in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that it derives.</span> If the animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>food placed at <span class="gemarra-regular">the side of </span>the public <span class="gemarra-regular">square, </span>which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged, </span>as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. If the animal ate produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from the entrance of the store, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that it derives, </span>as the status of a store entrance is like that of the public domain. If the animal ate produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from inside the store,</span> its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: Eating is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in that an animal tends <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat that which is fit for it </span>to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is this applied? In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a domesticated animal that entered the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and it ate food fit for it </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if it drank drinks fit for it </span>to drink, the owner of the animal must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And similarly, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal that entered the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and tore apart a domesticated animal and ate </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>there, the owner must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
And in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow that ate barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> although this is not normally a food that a cow would eat, or in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey that ate vetches, </span>i.e., legumes which are usually fed to cows but not to donkeys, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dog that licked oil or a pig ate meat, </span>the owner of the animal must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Although these animals do not ordinarily consume these items, doing so is not a significant deviation from the animal’s typical behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Now that you said </span>that eating <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not typical for </span>an animal to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it eats it under duress </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered </span>an ordinary act of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating, </span>it can be deduced that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cat that eats date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a donkey that is eating fish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>despite the fact that these animals do not ordinarily eat these items.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain donkey that ate bread and </span>while eating it also <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in which the bread was stored. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda obligated </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for </span>the loss of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bread and half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage to the basket. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why? Since it is typical for </span>a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat bread, it is also typical </span>for it <span class="gemarra-regular">to break the baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in which the bread is stored; therefore, the owner should pay the full cost of the damage for the basket as well. The Gemara answers: This case is one where the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">broke </span>the basket, a sequence which demonstrates that its intent was to cause damage. The breaking of the basket is therefore a subcategory of Goring, and the owner is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it typical for </span>a donkey to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">bread? </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>against this based on a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it ate bread or meat or a cooked dish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay for half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. What, is it not referring to a domesticated animal </span>and thereby implying that it is not typical for a domesticated animal to eat bread? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal, </span>which does not typically eat bread, but a domesticated animal does eat bread.
The Gemara questions this explanation: If the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal, </span>then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">typical for it </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">meat. </span>The Gemara clarifies: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">meat that is roasted, </span>and it is not typical for an undomesticated animal to eat roasted meat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, if you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not stated with regard to an undomesticated predator, but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a deer, </span>which does not ordinarily eat meat and bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, if you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>it is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">a domesticated animal, </span>but it is discussing a case where the animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">at the table, </span>and this is not typical behavior for an animal. 

Daf 20a

The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain goat that saw a turnip on top of a clay barrel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dedanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It climbed </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">went up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">ate the turnip, and </span>in doing so it <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the barrel. Rava obligated </span>the owner of the goat to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">for the turnip and for the barrel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he held the owner fully liable for the clay barrel as well as for the turnip? After all, breaking barrels is not the typical behavior of a goat. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is typical </span>for the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">turnip, it is also typical </span>for it <span class="gemarra-regular">to clim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and go up</span> in order to get it. Consequently, breaking the vessel is categorized as Eating.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ilfa says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a domesticated animal </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, and it stretched out its neck and ate from </span>a sack of produce that was loaded on <span class="gemarra-regular">the back of another </span>animal, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of the damage. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The back of the other </span>animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered like the courtyard of the injured </span>party, and for this reason the owner of the animal is liable for damage classified as Eating there.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports his </span>opinion (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 1:7): If a person was standing in the public domain, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> basket </span>containing food <span class="gemarra-regular">was slung behind his back, and </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">stretched out its neck and ate from it, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara rejects this: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not support Ilfa’s opinion, because one could explain that the case in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava says </span>in a different situation: The ruling is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a jumping </span>animal; <span class="gemarra-regular">here also </span>it can be suggested that the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a jumping </span>animal, and since the animal engaged in atypical behavior it is classified as a case of Goring as opposed to a case of Eating. For damage classified as Goring, the owner of the animal is liable for his animal’s actions in the public domain, although he pays only half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where, </span>i.e., in what context, <span class="gemarra-regular">was Rava’s </span>interpretation initially <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>The Gemara answers: It was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that which Rabbi Oshaya says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a domesticated animal </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking along and eating in the public domain </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>but if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">standing and eating </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara questions this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was walking? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>eating while walking <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">typical </span>behavior of an animal? But <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>and eating <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">typical </span>behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>Rabbi Oshaya’s ruling is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a jumping </span>animal, which is not typical behavior for the animal.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: </span>If an animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">rolling, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case about which Rabbi Zeira inquires? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheaf </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it was rolled along </span>by the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the sheaf <span class="gemarra-regular">went from the private property into the public domain, </span>and the animal ate it there, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Should this be treated as a case of Eating on private property, rendering the owner of the animal liable, or should it be treated as a case of Eating in the public domain, thereby exempting him from liability?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a load </span>of food was located <span class="gemarra-regular">partly inside </span>the property of its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and partly outside </span>of his property, i.e., in the public domain, and an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate inside </span>the private property, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as this is a case of damage classified as Eating on the property of the injured party. But if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate outside, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Eating in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that the case is one where the food was <span class="gemarra-regular">rolling along, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows the location where it was actually eaten? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">It ate, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">for that which was </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the private property, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if the food rolled out of the private property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for that which was </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead that there is a different resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Ḥiyya stated</span> his ruling it was with regard to a long <span class="gemarra-regular">stalk of fodder [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">de’a</span><span class="gemarra-italic">spasta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that was partly inside and partly outside at the time it was consumed, and as the animal ate it the entire stalk was pulled to where the animal was standing.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate garments </span>or vessels, the owner must pay for half the cost of the damage. In what case is this statement said? It is said when the animal ate them while located on the property of the injured party, but if he ate them in the public domain the owner of the animal is exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To which</span> case is this referring? In which case is one exempt from liability if the damage occurred in the public domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the cases. One is exempt from liability in the public domain even if his animal ate garments or vessels, despite the fact that this is an unusual thing for the animal to do and therefore eating garments or vessels should be classified as a case of Goring, which would normally result in liability when it occurs in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Rav answers his own question by stating a principle: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who deviate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from normative behavior in his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">if another came along </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">and deviates </span>from the norm <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from liability. In this case, the injured party left his garments or vessels in the public domain and thereby deviated from normative behavior, and therefore the owner of the animal that acted atypically and ate them is exempt from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: They taught </span>in the mishna that one is exempt from liability for damage caused in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where his animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit or vegetables, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Eating in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or vessels </span>in the public domain, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay for half the cost of the damage. Since this is atypical animal behavior, it is classified as a case of Goring, for which the owner of the animal is liable even if it occurs in the public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Reish Lakish said, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rav: The exemption discussed in the mishna was said in reference <span class="gemarra-regular">to all of </span>the cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish follows his </span>own line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Reish Lakish says: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two cows in the public domain, one prone and one walking, </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>cow <span class="gemarra-regular">kicked the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prone </span>cow, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability; but if the <span class="gemarra-regular">prone </span>cow kicked <span class="gemarra-regular">the walking </span>cow, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>This indicates that Reish Lakish accepts the principle: Anyone who deviates from normative behavior, if another came along afterward and deviates from the norm with regard to the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is exempt. Since it is atypical behavior for a cow to lie down in the public domain, even if the walking cow also behaved atypically and kicked the prone cow, its owner is exempt from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">They taught</span> in the mishna that one is exempt from liability in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if his animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit or vegetables, but </span>if the animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">garments or vessels, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept Reish Lakish’s opinion even in </span>the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two cows? </span>The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>it is possible that Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>the opinion of Reish Lakish, but he distinguishes between the cases. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">people to put their cloaks down </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to rest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">umitpeḥi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and this is not considered atypical behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is not common </span>for an <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>to lie down in the public domain, and since this animal behaved in an atypical manner, no liability is borne by the owner of the walking cow for engaging in atypical behavior and kicking the prone cow.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derives benefit </span>from eating another’s produce in the public domain, although the owner is exempt from paying for the damage it caused, nevertheless the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for the benefit that it derives. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is this payment, i.e., how is it calculated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of, </span>i.e., the amount one would pay, for an equal quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks </span>of hay or straw. This is because the owner can claim that had his animal not eaten the produce, he would have fed it inexpensive straw, so the animal’s benefit is limited to the cost of the straw that it would have eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If the animal ate barley, his owner must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the barley, </span>i.e., as that is typical animal food, but <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cheapest </span>price available in the market.
The Gemara notes: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba </span>and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava. </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: </span>The animal’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the value of stalks </span>of straw.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 1:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived benefit </span>from eating another’s produce, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that it derived</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How so? </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should pay their value. Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">estimates how much a person would pay in order to feed his animal </span>typical food <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for it </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>this particular animal <span class="gemarra-regular">does not usually </span>eat that food, as its owner gives it cheaper food. Therefore, if the animal ate barley, which is typical animal fare, even though it does not usually do so, its owner must pay compensation for the barley that was eaten, at its cheapest market price. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate wheat or </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">item that is detrimental to </span>it, so that it did not derive any benefit, if this occurred in the public domain the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from all liability.
§ In connection to the principle stated in the mishna, that if the animal derives benefit the owner of the animal pays for the benefit that it derived, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to Rami bar Ḥama: You were not with us at night within </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">boundar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when we raised dilemmas </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">exceptional matters. </span>Rami bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>are the <span class="gemarra-regular">exceptional matters</span> you discussed? Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge </span>or permission, <span class="gemarra-regular">must he pay him ren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for living there <span class="gemarra-regular">or does he not need to </span>pay him rent?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this question? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the case concerns <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that does not stand to be rented out, </span>i.e., if the squatter would not have lived there the owner would have kept it vacant, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the man </span>squatting there is someone who would <span class="gemarra-regular">not have rented </span>other living quarters because he has other lodgings available to him for free, then it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the squatter, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not derive benefit, and that </span>one, the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not suffer a loss</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in that case certainly no payment is necessary. Rather, say that the discussion concerns a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that stands to be rented out, and the man </span>squatting there would <span class="gemarra-regular">have rented </span>other living quarters. If so, then this is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">derives benefit and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">suffers a loss, </span>and in that case he certainly must make payment. The dilemma was not with regard to either of these circumstances.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to raise the dilemma in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that does not stand to be rented out, but the man </span>squatting there <span class="gemarra-regular">would have rented </span>other living quarters had he not squatted in this property. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? Is the squatter legally <span class="gemarra-regular">able to say to </span>the owner of the courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">What loss have I caused you, </span>as you would not have rented it out anyway? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the owner of the courtyard is legally <span class="gemarra-regular">able to say </span>to the squatter: 

Daf 20b

<span class="gemarra-regular">You have derived benefit </span>from my property, as by living there you saved the money you otherwise would have had to pay in order to rent out a different courtyard, and therefore you must pay me for the benefit you derived.
Rami bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This dilemma is not new; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>discussed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>and the mishna already provided a solution. Rav Ḥisda asked him: To <span class="gemarra-regular">which mishna </span>are you referring? Rami bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: After you serve me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> I will tell you. Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>hold of Rami bar Ḥama’s <span class="gemarra-regular">scarf [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">suderei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wrapped </span>it around <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>in the manner it is usually worn. Rami bar Ḥama then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derives benefit, </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived. </span>This demonstrates that one who derives benefit must pay for the benefit he derives, even if the injured party is not entitled to payment for his loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: How </span>little does <span class="gemarra-regular">a man who has the assistance of his Lord have to worry or be concerned </span>about the possibility that his opinion may not be accepted, <span class="gemarra-regular">as even though </span>the dilemma that was raised is in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">not similar to </span>the case in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>quoted by Rami bar Ḥama, Rav Ḥisda nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted it from him. This </span>case in the mishna, about the animal eating produce in the public domain, is where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss, and that </span>case of the squatter living in the courtyard, is where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama </span>think? Why does he equate the two cases? The Gemara explains: He holds that if <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain without specification </span>with regard to its ownership, it is assumed that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has rendered it ownerless. </span>The owner does not expect to derive benefit from the produce, and therefore when the animal ate it he suffered no loss. Consequently, it is a case where this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, and it is comparable to the case of the squatter in the courtyard.
The Gemara attempts to cite conclusive evidence from another case: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 4b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s </span>fields <span class="gemarra-regular">surround </span>the fields of <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on three sides, and he fenced in the first, the second, and the third </span>field, thereby providing protection also to the other man’s field, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate </span>the owner of the inner field to share in the costs of the fence, as he can claim that he does not derive benefit from it, since his field remains exposed on the fourth side. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this indicates that if his fields surrounded the inner field on all four sides, and the owner of the outer fields fenced the field on the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>side as well, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does obligate </span>the owner of the inner field to share in the expenses.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, </span>the one who derives benefit is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay for that benefit. In this case, the owner of the inner field benefits from the fence while the owner of the outer field does not suffer a loss, because in any event he would have needed to build those fences, and the owner of the inner field is obligated to share in the expense. The Gemara rejects this: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there </span>because the owner of the outer field <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the inner field: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your </span>field <span class="gemarra-regular">caused me to have to </span>build the fence with <span class="gemarra-regular">a larger circumference </span>than I would have otherwise needed to had your field not been there, and therefore your field caused me an additional expense. This case is therefore similar to those where this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the continuation of that mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: If </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the surrounded, </span>i.e., inner, field <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and enclosed the fourth </span>side on his own, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes upon him </span>the obligation to pay his share of <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of it, as through his actions he demonstrated that he was interested in having the fence installed. The Gemara infers from this: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>the court imposes upon him the obligation to pay his share of all of it is because the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the surrounded </span>field arose and <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosed</span> the fourth side himself. By inference, had the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the surrounding </span>field built the fourth fence, the owner of the inner field would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, </span>the one who derives benefit is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara rejects this: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there </span>because the owner of the inner field <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the surrounding fields: <span class="gemarra-regular">For me, the protection </span>of a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">worth a dinar would have been sufficient; </span>I did not wish to pay for such an expensive fence.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 117a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">a house and its upper story, </span>which belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to two </span>separate people, <span class="gemarra-regular">collapsed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> necessitating that the entire structure be rebuilt, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the upper story told the owner of the </span>lower story of the <span class="gemarra-regular">house to build </span>the lower story again so that he could rebuild the upper story, but the owner of the lower story <span class="gemarra-regular">does not want to </span>do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the upper story may build </span>the lower story of the <span class="gemarra-regular">house and live in it until </span>the owner of the lower story <span class="gemarra-regular">will pay him for his expenses,</span> and only then will he be required to vacate the lower story of the house and build the upper story.
The Gemara infers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">his expenses that the owner of the </span>lower story of the <span class="gemarra-regular">house is obligated to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">him, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>subtract from the amount compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for rent </span>for the time that the owner of the upper story lived in the lower story of the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, </span>the one who derives benefit is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as the owner of the upper story derived benefit from living in the lower story, while the owner of the lower story did not suffer a loss, since he said he did not need it. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there because the </span>lower story of the <span class="gemarra-regular">house is subjugated to the upper story, </span>because it also serves as the foundation of the upper story, and therefore the owner of the lower story of the house is obligated to provide lodging to the owner of the upper story in the interim.
The Gemara attempts another resolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a proof from the continuation of the mishna, in which Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and holds that the owner of the upper story may not reside in the lower story of the house without payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>A proof that the owner of the upper story must pay rent is from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">even this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must pay him rent. Conclude from </span>the mishna that when <span class="gemarra-regular">this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, </span>the one who derives benefit is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay. The Gemara rejects this: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>as there it is possible to claim that the owner of the lower story suffers a loss <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the blackening of the walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as when a person lives in a home, the value of the house depreciates due to the use.
This dilemma was not successfully resolved so <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent it </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">academy of Rabbi Ami </span>to ask his opinion. Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">said: And what did </span>this squatter <span class="gemarra-regular">do to</span> the owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">What loss did he cause him? How did he damage him? </span>Rav Ami holds that if this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, no payment is necessary. When asked about this dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Let us consider the matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> After waiting and not receiving a response <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent </span>the question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba again. He said: They keep sending me this </span>dilemma; <span class="gemarra-regular">had I found a response </span>to their question, <span class="gemarra-regular">would I not have sent them </span>a reply? They should have realized that Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba did not have an answer for them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> discussed this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He need not pay him rent, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He must pay him rent.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abbahu, </span>citing Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">was not stated explicitly; rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated from an inference </span>that Rabbi Abbahu drew from something that Rabbi Yoḥanan said in a different context. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Me’ila</span> 5:4): If the treasurer of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>that had been <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, he has not </span>violated the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. This is because his act of taking the stone or the beam has not effectively removed it from within the jurisdiction of Temple property, as any item under his control is in the possession of the Temple treasury.
If the treasurer <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to another </span>as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>has then <span class="gemarra-regular">misused </span>consecrated property, as he removed it from the possession of the Temple and conveyed it into the possession of another. But <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>man, who received the item, has <span class="gemarra-regular">not misused </span>a consecrated item until he actually uses the item. If the treasurer himself <span class="gemarra-regular">built it into his house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has not </span>violated the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">until he has lived beneath it </span>for an amount of time <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: And this </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> provided <span class="gemarra-regular">that he placed it over the skylight, </span>as were he to have built it into the actual structure of the house, he would have violated the prohibition of misuse with the very act of construction, as by doing so he effects a change in the stone itself. By contrast, when he places the stone in a place from which it is easy to remove it and give it back, then as long as he has not lived beneath it, he has not, as yet, misused consecrated property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abbahu sat before Rabbi Yoḥanan and </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">saying in the name of Shmuel: That is to say, one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent,</span> similar to the treasurer who resides beneath the consecrated beam without detracting from the value of the beam in any way but has nevertheless violated the prohibition of misuse since he has derived personal benefit from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">remained silent </span>and offered <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>no reply.
Rabbi Abbahu <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he was silent, </span>this must mean <span class="gemarra-regular">he concedes to his </span>conclusion, and therefore, from then on he would cite this opinion in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not so. </span>The reason Rabbi Yoḥanan was silent was because <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not pay attention </span>to Rabbi Abbahu and did not bother to contradict his opinion on the issue. In truth Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion is as was reported in his name by Rav Kahana, that a squatter living on someone else’s premises without his permission and without causing him any loss does not need to pay the owner any rent.
The Gemara explains the distinction between that case and the case of the consecrated stone or beam. The reason the treasurer of consecrated property is considered to have misused consecrated property by deriving benefit from it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba, as Rabba says: Consecrated </span>property from which one derived benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>the Temple treasury’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge</span>

Daf 21a

is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to an action involving non-sacred property belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary person, </span>which was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge </span>and against his wishes. This is because consecrated property belongs to the Almighty, and it is therefore meaningless to speak of a situation where the owner is unaware of what is being done. Consequently, anyone who derives benefit from consecrated property is in violation of the prohibition of misuse, but it cannot be inferred from this that one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Zavda sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to Mari bar Mar </span>saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raise </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge need to pay him rent or not? In the meantime, </span>before he was able to respond to the question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna died.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, son of Rav Huna, said to him </span>in response to the question that was asked of his father: <span class="gemarra-regular">So did my father, my Master, say in the name of Rav: He does not need to pay him rent. And </span>he also stated another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who rents a house from Reuve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must pay rent to Shimon. </span>The Gemara is puzzled: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon? What does he </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span> with this? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what he is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying, </span>i.e., what he means: If it <span class="gemarra-regular">is discovered that the house </span>he rented did not actually belong to Reuven but rather it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon’s, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay rent to </span>Shimon.
The Gemara questions this statement: Did Rav Huna state <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>contradictory <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>? On the one hand he says that one who resides in a courtyard without the owner’s knowledge does not need to pay rent, but on the other hand he says that if it is discovered that the true owner of a rented house was someone else, and therefore the tenant was living in another’s courtyard without the owner’s knowledge, he is obligated to pay him rent. The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>second <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, which stated that he is obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <span class="gemarra-regular">stands to be rented out, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, which stated that he is not obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not stand to be rented out.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was also stated: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: One who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent, and one who rents a house from the residents of the city must pay rent to the owners. </span>The Gemara is puzzled: <span class="gemarra-regular">Owners? What do they </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>with this? The case concerns one who rents a property from the residents of the city, i.e., the house is public property. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">discovered that</span> the house <span class="gemarra-regular">did have owners </span>and was not public property, the renters <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay rent to </span>those owners.
The Gemara wonders about this: Did he state <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>contradictory <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>second <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, which stated that he is obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <span class="gemarra-regular">stands to be rented out, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, which stated that he does not need to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not stand to be rented out.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Seḥora says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent because it is stated: </span>“Desolation remains in the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the gate is stricken unto ruin” </span>(Isaiah 24:12), i.e., a house that is not lived in will collapse at some point due to neglect. Consequently, one who lives inside an otherwise uninhabited house is providing a service to the homeowner, as he maintains the house and prevents it from falling apart. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I saw this </span>ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">and it gores like an ox, </span>i.e., it is devastating. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef stated </span>a similar idea: <span class="gemarra-regular">A home that is lived in is settled </span>and safeguarded, while a home that is not lived in has no one to look after it and maintain it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>what Rav said and what Rav Yosef said? The Gemara answers: The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span> is with regard to a house that the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">uses </span>to store <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and straw. </span>The house is not empty and desolate but there is nobody living in it. According to Rav Yosef’s reasoning, a squatter there would not have to pay rent to the homeowner.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who built a mansion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apadna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a garbage heap [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akilkalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belonging to orphans, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman confiscated his mansion from him </span>as he did not pay the owners of the property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent? </span>The Gemara rejects this: No, there is no proof taken from this case, because it was a unique situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">In that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">Carmanians</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> nomadic tribes, <span class="gemarra-regular">were initially living on </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they would pay the orphans a small amoun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for the use of the land, and when this man built his mansion he removed the Carmanians from there. Rav Naḥman had <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the man who built the mansion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and appeas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the orphans </span>with regard to their lost income, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not pay attention</span> to the ruling. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman confiscated his mansion from him.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: Under <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> circumstances does the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> benefit that </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived? </span>If the animal ate produce in the public square in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal pays for the food from which it benefits. If the animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>When the mishna says that the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head to reach the food but the animal itself is standing completely inside the public domain and it eats while standing there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: Even if</span> it is standing in the public domain and it <span class="gemarra-regular">turns</span> its head to eat from food placed at the side of the public square, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">also exempt, </span>as the animal itself is in the public domain.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, how can you find </span>a case in which the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for all of the damage caused when his animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, as indicated by the mishna? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>when an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square and goes and stands at the side of the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and eats the food stored there. In that case its owner certainly pays for what it damaged, as this area is comparable to the property of the injured party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are those who teach this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">an independent </span>dispute and not as an explanation of the mishna: If an animal is standing in the public domain and <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head to eat from food placed at the side of the public square, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>Its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and Shmuel says: </span>Its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Sages asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>with regard to that which was said in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, that its owner pays for what it damaged, how can you find a case in which its owner will be liable? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>when an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square and goes and stands at the side of the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square, </span>and eats the food stored there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raises an objection </span>to this explanation of Shmuel’s opinion: The mishna says that if the animal ate produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from the entrance of the store, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived, </span>as the status of a store entrance is like that of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">How can you find</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>circumstances? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the discussion in this case concerns an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head from the public domain to the entrance of the store, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the Master <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived.</span> Evidently, for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived, yes, </span>this is what the owner pays, but he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pay for that <span class="gemarra-regular">which it damaged.</span>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection, and he resolved it </span>by explaining that the case in the mishna is one where a store <span class="gemarra-regular">is located on a corne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and it is situated in a way that some of the produce there would be in an animal’s path as it turns the corner, and therefore the animal would not need to turn its head away from the public domain in order to eat the produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who state </span>a different explanation of the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it turns </span>its head to eat from the sides of the public square, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>it is with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one allocates space from his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he does not have a use for it, and he adds this space <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain </span>by leaving it accessible for the public to use, and the damage took place in that area. The dispute is about whether the area is categorized as private property or the public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what was stated, </span>meaning this was their dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>that one is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head to the sides of the public square, as this area is categorized as private property, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if one allocated some space from his property </span>and added it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain </span>and the damage happened there, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as that area is treated as part of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: Even if he allocates space from his property </span>and adds it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>as the damage took place in an area with the legal status of private property.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say they disagree with regard to</span> the question of damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>that one dug <span class="gemarra-regular">inside one’s </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">domain </span>and then declared the area ownerless? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says </span>that the owner of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for eating the produce placed in an area that the owner added to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that if one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit</span> or creates an obstacle that can cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">within his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for any damage that is caused by the pit, as now that it is in the public domain, he bears the responsibility for it. Similarly, the produce is viewed as if it is in the public domain, and the animal’s owner is exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel, who says </span>that the owner of an animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for eating the produce placed in an area that the owner added to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that if one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit within his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span> and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as he dug the pit when the property was his. Similarly, the produce is viewed as if it is in the property of the injured party, and the animal’s owner is liable.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Actually, I will say to you</span>

Daf 21b

that <span class="gemarra-regular">usually, </span>if one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit within his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as he dug the pit when the property was his. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, because </span>here the owner of the animal can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the owner of the produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not all in your power to bring your produce close to the public domain and to </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">hold my ox liable for </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Usually, </span>if one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>or creates an obstacle that can cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">within his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> for any damage that is caused by the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">pit, granted, it is possible to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was not aware, </span>meaning the injured party was not thinking about the possibility that there may be a pit there that could cause him harm, and therefore the one who dug the pit is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>that is spread out over the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">can it be said that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was not aware </span>of it? It cannot be, because the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">sees </span>the produce.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that actually, the amoraic dispute about an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head and eats produce at the side of the road <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square, </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived; </span>but if it ate <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sides of the </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">square, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for that <span class="gemarra-regular">which it damaged. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Elazar say: It is not typical </span>for an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">but only to walk </span>there. Consequently, the owner is liable.
Initially, the Gemara understands Rabbi Yosei’s opinion as also referring to a situation in which the animal eats from the sides of the public square, and since this is so, it seems that the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei is </span>the same as that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Meir, and the mishna presents their opinions as differing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to a case in which the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head, the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">also pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived, while Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for that <span class="gemarra-regular">which it damaged.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>agrees about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">turns </span>its head, <span class="gemarra-regular">either in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav or in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel. And here they disagree </span>about the exemption inferred from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It consumed in the field of another” </span>(Exodus 22:4), which renders the owner of an animal liable for damage classified as Eating. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that only if it ate from private property is its owner liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not</span> when it eats <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>it means that even if it ate from the public domain its owner is liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not </span>when it eats <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of the one responsible for the damage; </span>only if the animal ate produce of another that was on the property of the animal’s owner, is its owner is exempt.
The Gemara challenges this: But not when it eats <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of the one responsible for the damage?</span> What is the novelty in this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the owner of the produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is your produce doing on my property? </span>The owner would certainly not be liable if the produce is damaged in that case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is with regard to the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">between Ilf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Oshaya </span>concerning an animal that ate produce from the back of another animal or the like. Rabbi Meir holds that one is never liable for damage classified as Eating in the public domain, even if his animal ate from the back of another, and Rabbi Yosei holds that if it ate off the back of another animal, this is equivalent to Eating from the property of the injured party.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dog or a goat that jumped from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and broke vessels </span>while doing so, their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>these animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> concerning to jumping. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dog that took a cake </span>that had been baked directly on hot coals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and went to a stack </span>of grain to eat it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it ate the cake </span>and at the same time <span class="gemarra-regular">ignited the stack </span>of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the cake, and </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay for half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage to the stack </span>of grain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>the owners must pay the full cost of the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">jumped </span>off the rooftop. This indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> off the roof, they would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from all liability despite his obligation to keep them from climbing onto the roof and jumping down from there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that in an incident that <span class="gemarra-regular">begins with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">negligence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning carelessness or even an intention to cause damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and ends in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accident</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one who caused the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt,</span> as in this case the owner was careless in allowing the animals to go to the rooftop, but since they did not jump off the roof but rather fell accidentally, he is exempt.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a dog or a goat jumped from a rooftop and broke vessels </span>while doing so, their owners must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. If they fell </span>from there, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from all liability. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says </span>that if an incident <span class="gemarra-regular">begins with negligence and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ends in an accident, </span>the one who caused the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but according to the one who says </span>that in such a case he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, what can be said? </span>It seems that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> constitutes conclusive proof against that opinion.
The Gemara answers: The case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the vessels were brought close to the wall </span>by their owners, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">jump </span>off the rooftop <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">leap they do not fall on top of them, </span>and the vessels broke because the animal fell and didn’t jump. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since in an ordinary circumstance no damage should occur, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case does <span class="gemarra-regular">not even begin with negligence. </span>Since the damage was caused by falling, the entire case is ruled an accident.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: Sometimes </span>one can be <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">fell </span>from the wall of their owner’s house. <span class="gemarra-regular">You find</span> such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the wall was unstable, </span>and the owner was negligent in allowing the animals to go up to the roof due to the danger of the wall collapsing. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because it should have occurred to him that bricks may fall </span>from the wall and break the vessels? But <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately, no bricks fell and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">fell, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>actually a case that <span class="gemarra-regular">begins with negligence and ends in an accident. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a narrow wall, </span>in which case it is clear that if when they climb up there they will fall, and that is why he is liable for the damage they cause by falling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a dog or a goat jumped from below to </span>something that was <span class="gemarra-regular">above</span> them and thereby caused damage, their owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this is atypical behavior. But if they jumped <span class="gemarra-regular">from above to below,</span> their owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of any damage they cause, as this is typical behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">If a person or a chicken jumped </span>and broke something, <span class="gemarra-regular">regardless of whether they jumped from above to below or from below to above, they are liable. </span>

Daf 22a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a dog or a goat jumped</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they jumped <span class="gemarra-regular">from above to below or from below to above, </span>their owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from all liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa interpreted </span>it in the following way: Their manners of movement <span class="gemarra-regular">were changed </span>from the typical manner of movement for their species. The <span class="gemarra-regular">dog </span>moved <span class="gemarra-regular">by leaping [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bizkira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat </span>moved <span class="gemarra-regular">by climbing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bisrikha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, why </span>are the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability? After all, they still caused damage. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not intend to say that they are completely exempt, but that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage; they are, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage,</span> as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in any case of damage caused by atypical behavior, as such acts are classified as Goring.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dog that took </span>a cake that had been baked directly on hot coals, and went to a stack of grain to eat it, and it ate the cake and at the same time ignited the stack of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must pay the full cost of the damage for the cake, and he must pay for half the cost of the damage to the stack of grain.
With regard to damage caused by a fire lit by one person spreading to a location other than where it was lit, the Gemara cites a dispute among the <span class="it-text">amora’</span><span class="it-text">im</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>His liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that damage caused by a fire in a location other than where it was lit is comparable to damage caused by an arrow shot at a distant target. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says: </span>His liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> he is responsible for this damage just as he is responsible for damage caused elsewhere by any of his possessions, e.g., one of his animals.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish did not state </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan? </span>The Gemara answers: He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that fire is not comparable to an arrow, as <span class="gemarra-regular">an arrow proceeds </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">force, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">does not proceed </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">force, </span>but requires a wind to carry it from the location where it was lit to the location of the damage. The Gemara asks about the other opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan did not state </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish? </span>The Gemara answers: He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that one’s fire is not comparable to his possessions, as <span class="gemarra-regular">property is </span>a tangible <span class="gemarra-regular">substance </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a tangible <span class="gemarra-regular">substance.</span>
The Gemara attempts to settle the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dog that took a cak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that had been baked directly on hot coals, and went to a stack of grain to eat it, and it ate the cake and at the same time ignited the stack of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must pay the full cost of the damage for the cake, and he must pay for half the cost of the damage to the stack of grain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, </span>this fire is similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrows of the dog, </span>and therefore he must pay for half the cost of the damage caused by the dog’s force, as in a case of pebbles.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, this fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not the property of the owner of the dog; </span>rather, it is the property of the owner of the cake, so why is the owner of the dog liable?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case where the dog took the coal and did not place the cake on the stack, rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it threw it </span>onto the stack. The ruling of the mishna is: <span class="gemarra-regular">For the cake </span>which the dog ate, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">spot </span>on the stack of grain that was damaged by the throwing of the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal </span>there, the owner must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay for half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>as in a case of pebbles. <span class="gemarra-regular">And for the stack </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">as a whole, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>because his liability for damage caused by the spread of the fire is due to its similarity to his property, and in this case it was not his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>can explain the mishna in a more straightforward manner. It is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>the cake with the coal directly on the stack of grain in order to eat the cake. Accordingly, the owner of the dog must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage for the cake and for the </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">spot </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal </span>was put down, as these cases of damage were caused directly by the dog. <span class="gemarra-regular">And for </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the stack </span>of grain, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay for half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion one is liable for the damage caused by fire due to its similarity to arrows shot by his force. The damage to the rest of the stack of grain is an indirect result of the dog’s force, and therefore his liability is according the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (62b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">laden with fla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and was passing through the public domain, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">its flax extended into a store </span>at the edge of the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the flax <span class="gemarra-regular">caught fire from a lamp </span>in the store <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to the storekeeper, and </span>as a result of the burning flax the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">set fire to the building </span>together with all its contents, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the camel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the damage. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">the storekeeper placed his lamp outside </span>in the public domain, thereby causing the flax on the camel to catch fire, and consequently the building was set on fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">the storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In </span>a case where the lamp placed outside was <span class="gemarra-regular">a Hanukkah lamp, </span>the storekeeper is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability, as there is a mitzva to place a Hanukkah lamp outside.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, </span>the fire in the store <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrows of the camel, </span>and that is why the camel’s owner is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that liability for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not the property of the owner of the camel. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the camel moved the burning flax around and <span class="gemarra-regular">ignited the entire building, </span>lighting one spot after another. The fire did not need to spread since the camel directly set the building on fire in each of those spots, and therefore this case is comparable to that of a dog who moved the coal around from place to place.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the storekeeper placed his lamp outside, the storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And if </span>the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">ignited </span>the entire building, spot by spot, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is the storekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> His fire did not spread through the building; it was the camel that moved it around from one place to another. The Gemara answers: The case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the camel did not move around, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>still, but since there was an extremely large load of flax on its back, once it caught fire it ignited the entire building simultaneously.
The Gemara asks: If the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>without moving from place to place, but did shift the load on its back and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">ignited </span>the entire building, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">that the storekeeper </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from any liability <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">camel </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as it was his responsibility to move the camel away from there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Manoah said in the name of Rav Ika: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>still in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to urinate </span>and while doing so set the building ablaze; in that case the incident is deemed an accident as the owner could not have moved the camel from the spot. 

Daf 22b

Consequently, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the camel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not have overloaded </span>the camel with flax to such a degree that it extended out so far from the sides that it could catch fire and ignite the store. But in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, as he should not have placed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lamp outside.</span>
The Gemara attempts again to resolve the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a mishna (61b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who ignites a stack </span>of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there was a goat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tied to </span>the stack, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there was also a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave adjacent to i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> who was not tied to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>both the goat and the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">were burned </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the stack of grain and killed, the one who ignited the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation for both the stack and the goat, but he is exempt from paying for the slave because the slave should have run from the fire. Conversely, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">slave was tied to </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a goat adjacent to it </span>that was not tied to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the slave and the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">were burned </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the stack of grain, the one who ignited the fire is completely <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment for damage because he is liable to receive capital punishment for murder, and he is punished only for the greater transgression.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, due to that </span>reasoning he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> for the damage to the stack of grain in the second case, because it is as if he killed the slave with his arrows and consequently became subject to receive court-imposed capital punishment, and one who is subject to the death penalty is not liable to pay monetary compensation for the same act, as he receives the greater punishment of the two. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that liability for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? If his ox, </span>which is his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">were to kill a slave, would he also not be liable </span>to pay for the damage?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he lit the body of the slave on fire, </span>consequently becoming subject to the death penalty as would anyone who kills a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he receives the greater </span>punishment, the death penalty, but he does not also have to pay for the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, what </span>is the purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">of stating </span>this; what novel idea is it supposed to teach? One who lit a slave on fire is most certainly a murderer, and a murderer is exempt from paying for damage caused while committing the murder. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the goat </span>belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and the slave </span>belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span>different person; in that case one might have thought that since payment is due to someone other than the owner of the murdered slave, he would be required to pay the owner of the goat, despite being subject to the death penalty for killing the slave. Therefore, this mishna teaches that since he committed one act, for which he is liable to receive the death penalty, he is exempt from paying compensation to anyone as a result of that act.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a mishna (59b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sends a fire, </span>i.e., places a burning object, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a mino</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for any damage later caused by the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that he would not be held liable in court, but nevertheless he remains responsible to pay for what he has done.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>similar to the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrows of a deaf-mute </span>or an imbecile or a minor, and this is why the one who gave them the fire is exempt from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he were to convey his ox to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, would he also not be liable? </span>That is impossible, as there is an explicit statement in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (10a) saying that he would be liable.
The Gemara answers: But it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">about this that Reish Lakish says in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiyya: They taught </span>that one is exempt from the damage caused by a fire that he had entrusted in the care of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he conveyed a coal to him and </span>the deaf-mute <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned </span>the coal into a flame, which then caused damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he conveyed an open <span class="gemarra-regular">flame to him </span>and it caused damage, the one who gave him the flame is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. What is the reason </span>for this? This is because the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage is self-evident, </span>i.e., it is clear that damage will ensue, and it is as if he placed a goring ox under his care. Therefore, if one’s liability for damage classified as Fire is due to its similarity to damage caused by one’s property, he would be liable in this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who holds that one’s liability for damage caused by fire is due to its similarity to one’s arrows, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt even </span>if he conveyed an open <span class="gemarra-regular">flame </span>to him, because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the deaf-mute’s handling </span>of the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">that causes </span>the blaze, and it is therefore not similar to a case of arrows shot; the one who conveys a fire to the deaf-mute <span class="gemarra-regular">does not become liable </span>for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">until he hands </span>the deaf-mute <span class="gemarra-regular">chopped wood, kindling chips, and a lamp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as in that case, the damage that will ensue is self-evident and it is as if he started the blaze himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A verse and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> both <span class="gemarra-regular">support Rabbi Yoḥanan’s </span>opinion. The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>supporting his opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “If fire breaks out” </span>(Exodus 22:5), indicating that the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks out on its own; </span>yet the verse continues, <span class="gemarra-regular">“the one who ignited the fire shall pay,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> indicating that the fire was ignited by a person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the verse that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire is due to </span>its similarity to damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, </span>as the resolution of the apparent inconsistency in the verse is that it relates to the individual as if he had himself started the blaze, and that is why he is obligated to pay for the damage.
The <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> supporting his opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: The verse </span>concerning liability for a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">opened</span>

Daf 23a

<span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s possessions, </span>as it is written: “If fire breaks out,” indicating that his responsibility for the fire is the same as his responsibility for any of his possessions that cause damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it concludes with </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body,</span> as the verse refers to the person by calling him “the one who ignited the fire,” <span class="gemarra-regular">telling you </span>that his liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>raised <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty: According to the one who says </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire is due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows, how can you fin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One exempted </span>one from liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed </span>items damaged by a <span class="gemarra-regular">fire? </span>If one caused damage by shooting an arrow, he would be equally liable for damaging both exposed and concealed items. Consequently, if one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is due to its similarity to his arrows, he should similarly be liable for concealed items damaged by a fire.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">satisfactory for him, </span>i.e., Abaye resolved the difficulty. He explained that the exemption from liability for concealed items damaged by a fire applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a fire broke out in that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, and </span>afterward the <span class="gemarra-regular">fence </span>separating this courtyard from the neighbor’s courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">collapsed, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to the fire, and</span> therefore the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">spread and ignited </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">and caused damage in another courtyard. </span>In such a circumstance he would be exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because there, </span>in this case, it is as if <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows were depleted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he bears responsibility for the fire that he had started, which initially was confined to his courtyard alone. The fire that spread to the neighboring courtyard is not similar to his arrows, and therefore he is exempt.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>he should be exempt not only with regard to concealed items but also <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to exposed </span>items that were damaged by the fire, as <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows are also depleted </span>when the fire spreads and causes damage. If his exemption is due to fact that the damage was caused because the wall that had separated the two courtyards had collapsed, there should be no distinction between exposed and concealed items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who holds </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that his liability is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fire’s similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property. </span>Consequently, it remains possible for a circumstance to exist in which one will be exempt from liability for damaging concealed items and yet be held liable for exposed items. <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, if he had </span>the ability to repair the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">and fence</span> in the courtyard again <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not fence </span>it in, he will be liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>is similar to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>was in danger of escaping from his property and <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not strike </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in its fac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to hold it back, and therefore he is liable for any ensuing damage. In this case, however, the fire is not similar to his arrows since it was not responsible for the collapse of the fence, and therefore he is exempt from damage caused to concealed items, according to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Fire.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this conclusion, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the one who holds </span>that one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows also holds </span>that his liability is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish?
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">holding him liable </span>for the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in a case where the fire injured a person. In such an instance Rabbi Yoḥanan would require, in addition to the costs of the damage itself, payments for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, as in any case of personal injury, given that Rabbi Yoḥanan considers Fire to be no different than an arrow he had shot at the injured party.
§ The mishna teaches that he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the full cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">for the cake </span>the dog ate but must pay for only half the cost of the damage to the burned stack of grain. The Gemara elucidates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the one <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay for the cake? The <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dog. </span>The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal also be liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he shares some of the responsibility, being that he did not safeguard his coal and it ultimately caused damage? The Gemara answers: The case under discussion is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the coal <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarded his coal </span>properly.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where he safeguarded his coa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does the dog want, </span>i.e., what is it doing <span class="gemarra-regular">there? </span>If the dog was able to get in there, it cannot be that the owner of the coal safeguarded it properly. The Gemara answers: The case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">burrowed </span>under the fence, entered the property, and took the cake and the coal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary doors are </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">vulnerable to being burrowed </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">by a do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> because if it would be atypical for a dog to burrow under the door, the owner of the dog would be exempt from payment. Therefore, it must be that it is typical behavior for a dog to burrow beneath a door, and therefore it was incumbent upon the owner of the door to prevent it from causing damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where did it eat </span>the cake? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that it ate it </span>after placing it <span class="gemarra-regular">on a stack </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to another, </span>i.e., someone other than the owner of the cake, then he should not be liable for the damage to the cake under the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in order to hold someone liable <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>fulfillment of scenario described in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it consumed in the field of another” </span>(Exodus 22:4), meaning that an act of damage classified as Eating must be caused on the property of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is not</span> the case in this instance. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>only in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the cake after placing it <span class="gemarra-regular">on a stack </span>of grain owned <span class="gemarra-regular">by the owner of the cake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and that is why the dog’s owner is liable, as it ate it while on the property of the injured party.
§ The Gemara suggests: From here it is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>a dilemma and prove <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth of a cow</span>

Daf 23b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is like the courtyard of the injured </span>party, i.e., it is not a separate domain from the place in which the animal is eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">As if </span>the mouth of the animal were to be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage, let </span>the owner of the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is your bread doing in my dog’s mouth? </span>The dog’s mouth is my domain, and I am not liable for damage classified as Eating done to your property in my domain.
The Gemara notes: The need for this type of inference arises from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that a dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the mouth of a cow like the courtyard of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is it like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage, </span>i.e., the owner of the cow?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the mouth of the cow is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> how can you find </span>a case of damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>for which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One holds </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one must pay for damage classified as Eating only if it occurred on the property of the injured party. If the mouth of an animal is deemed the domain of the animal’s owner, damage caused by an animal eating would always take place in the domain of the animal’s owner and he would therefore be exempt from liability in every case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said: </span>It is possible to describe a case of Eating that would render the animal’s owner liable according to the one who holds that the mouth of a cow is like the domain of its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>if the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">rubbed </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">against a wall for its pleasure </span>and broke it, or if the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">soiled produce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure. </span>Any action in which an animal engages for its own pleasure is classified as Eating, and if the animal causes damage thereby within the domain belonging to the injured party, its owner will be held liable since nothing has entered the mouth of the animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra objects to </span>these examples of Eating: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in order to create liability under the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">I require </span>fulfillment of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As consumes the tooth until it be all gone” </span>(I Kings 14:10), meaning that the damaged item must be completely destroyed or consumed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>here that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case, as the stones of the broken wall and the soiled produce have not been destroyed. To answer Mar Zutra’s question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is possible for a cow to cause complete destruction by rubbing against a wall, e.g., a cow <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">erases </span>any decorative <span class="gemarra-regular">image</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that were adorning the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>It is possible for cow to cause complete destruction by soiling produce, e.g., a cow <span class="gemarra-regular">that trods on</span> the produce and crushes it, thereby totally eradicating it. Consequently, the initial question about the status of the cow’s mouth remains.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a resolution from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he incited a dog against </span>another person, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he incited a snake against </span>another person, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>(<span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 66b). The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? The one who incited </span>the dog is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dog </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And if you say </span>that the mouth of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the courtyard of the one liable for the damage, let </span>the owner of the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does your hand want, </span>i.e., what is it doing, <span class="gemarra-regular">in my dog’s mouth, </span>which is my domain?
The Gemara answers: The mishna could be understood a different way. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the one who incited </span>the dog is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as the dog is not his property, but the dog owner is also exempt because his dog’s mouth has a legal status similar to that of the dog owner’s courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the case under discussion is one where the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">extended his canine teeth and scratched the </span>victim, but the victim’s hand was not inside his mouth, and therefore this incident cannot be treated as if it took place in the domain of the owner of the dog.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution based on the continuation of the above mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one caused the snake to bite </span>a person by bringing the fangs of the snake to the victim’s body, and the snake killed him, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>the one who instigated the attack <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive the death penalty <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis exempt </span>him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says </span>in explanation of the dispute: When you analyze the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">you will find that according to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, the venom of a snak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>deemed to be constantly <span class="gemarra-regular">present between its fangs, </span>and therefore when the snake is made to strike the victim it is not actively engaged in any action. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, </span>the person handling the snake is liable, similar to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">strikes </span>a victim <span class="gemarra-regular">with a sword, </span>while the <span class="gemarra-regular">snake </span>itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>as it has not done anything. And <span class="gemarra-regular">according to according to the statement of the Rabbis, the venom of a snake </span>is not present between its fangs but rather the snake must <span class="gemarra-regular">secrete </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">of its own volition. Consequently, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">snake </span>receives the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning </span>like any animal that kills a person, while the one who instigated the attack <span class="gemarra-regular">and striking </span>with it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mouth of the cow </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let </span>the owner of the snake metaphorically <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is your hand doing in my snake’s mouth? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not say </span>this principle <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to matters relating to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty; therefore, one who kills another is always liable, regardless of whether it occurred within the domain of the killer or within the domain of the victim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 5:13): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who enters the courtyard of a property owner without </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the property owner’s ox gores </span>the intruder <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, the ox </span>receives the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning while </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>having to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom? </span>He is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because he can </span>metaphorically <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">What do you want in my domain, </span>i.e., why were you there without permission? Since he entered the premises without authorization, he bears responsibility for his own fate. But if that is so, the same applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox as well, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">What do you want in my domain? </span>Rather, it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that this principle applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to matters relating to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty. Consequently, these cases do not prove that the mouth of the cow is like the courtyard of the victim within the scope of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damages.
§ The Gemara relates: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">these goats, </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Tarbu family</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that would </span>frequently <span class="gemarra-regular">damage Rav Yosef’s </span>property. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Abaye: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">tell their owners that they must keep </span>their goats enclosed within their own property. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yosef in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why should I go</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If I go </span>and deliver this message, <span class="gemarra-regular">they will say to me: Let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master put a fence up around his property</span> so that the goats will not be able to get in there.
The Gemara questions this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">did put up a fence</span> to safeguard his property from the Eating of other animals because he was required to do so, and had he not done so the owners of those animals would not be liable to pay for the damage caused by their animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating for </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One </span>holds the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>As, if it is the responsibility of the injured party to fence in his property, animals will not be able to get inside. The Gemara answers: A case in which the Torah holds the owner of the animal liable can be explained as one <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">burrowed under </span>the fence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it could be explained as a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the separating <span class="gemarra-regular">fence collapsed in </span>middle of <span class="gemarra-regular">the night </span>and the owner of the fence did not have the opportunity to repair it before the animals caused damage.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, would announce: Those that ascend </span>to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia, bringing with them the rulings of the Babylonian Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well as those that descend </span>to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, bringing the rulings of the sages of Eretz Yisrael with them, all agree to the following <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these goats </span>that loiter <span class="gemarra-regular">in the marke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> until they are slaughtered and in the meantime <span class="gemarra-regular">cause damage </span>to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">we warn their owner two or three times. If </span>the owner of the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">heeds </span>the warning and safeguards his animals from damaging others, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he heeds</span> it and no further action is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, we say to him: </span>Go, <span class="gemarra-regular">sit next to the butcher shop and take your money, </span>meaning we instruct him to slaughter his goats immediately. Since he in any event intends to slaughter them, the court can force him to do so immediately. Otherwise, he cannot be forced to slaughter them as preventive measure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>type of ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and which </span>is deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> An ox is deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified about it </span>that it gored on <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">days.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>it reverts back to its previous <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>status <span class="gemarra-regular">from when it reverses its </span>behavior and refrains from goring for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>consecutive <span class="gemarra-regular">days; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: </span>It is deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>in any case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>gored <span class="gemarra-regular">three times, </span>regardless of the number of days on which this behavior occurred. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it reverts back to its previous <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>status in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where children pet it </span>and play with it <span class="gemarra-regular">and it does not gore </span>them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda</span> that an ox is deemed forewarned only if it gored on three separate days? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It states in the verse: “Or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox from yesterday and the day before yesterday, and its owner has not secured it” (Exodus 21:36). This leads to the following inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Yesterday” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">“from yesterday” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>days, <span class="gemarra-regular">“the day before yesterday” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>days, <span class="gemarra-regular">“and its owner has not secured it”; </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at a fourth </span>incident of <span class="gemarra-regular">goring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for which the owner pays the full amount of damages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: “Yesterday” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“from yesterday” </span>are not to be expounded separately. Rather, the inference from this phrase is that “from yesterday” indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">“the day before yesterday” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>days, <span class="gemarra-regular">“and its owner has not secured it” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>the third incident of goring, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>as a forewarned animal for the third goring.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who does not determine the forewarned status of an ox by the number of days on which the animal gored but simply by the number of times? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: </span>

Daf 24a

When the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">performs its gorings at intervals, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">performs its gorings successively</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>that its owner is liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span>Rabbi Meir: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">menstrual period [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will prove </span>that your <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is invalid: If <span class="gemarra-regular">her sightings occur at intervals, </span>i.e., if she sees a flow of uterine blood on three consecutive days, she becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure; </span>while if <span class="gemarra-regular">her sightings were consecutive, </span>for example if all three occurred on the same day, she remains <span class="gemarra-regular">pure.</span>
Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>The case of the <span class="it-text">zava</span> does not disprove my opinion, because the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>in reference to the parallel <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<span class="it-text">zav</span>]: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And this shall be his ritual impurity when he has a discharge” </span>(Leviticus 15:3). The word “this” emphasizes that in this matter the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> requires following the instructions of the verse precisely as they were recorded, and in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse associates </span>the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span> the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">sighting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of discharges the man observed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it associates <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>impurity of the <span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> during which she experienced sightings of blood, as it says: “Many days” (Leviticus 15:25). By contrast, with regard to the goring ox, the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference remains in place.
The Gemara asks about this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it determined <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>additional phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And this,” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>having her status determined by individual <span class="gemarra-regular">sightings </span>of blood, associating it instead with the number of days on which she experienced bleeding? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>instead that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>having his status determined by sightings on separate <span class="gemarra-regular">days, </span>indicating that he will be rendered a <span class="it-text">zav</span> only if he experienced three discharges on a single day and not on separate days. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And one who has a discharge, whether it be a man or a woman” </span>(Leviticus 15:33). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the ritual impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">a male to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">female’s </span>ritual impurity is caused by sightings on multiple <span class="gemarra-regular">days, so too </span>the ritual impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">a male </span>can be caused by sightings on multiple <span class="gemarra-regular">days.</span>
The Gemara asks: The derivation from the verse could just as easily lead to the opposite conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">compare </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">female to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">male; just as a male </span>becomes ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">sightings, </span>even if they all occur on the same day, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">a female </span>become ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">sightings, </span>even on the same day. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Merciful One excluded </span>this possibility by making use of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“and this.”</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did you see </span>to make you exclude associating the ritual impurity of women with the number of sightings, rather than excluding associating the ritual impu-rity of men with the number of days? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It stands to reason </span>that this is so, as the context of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">deals with sightings, </span>and therefore an additional phrase serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude sightings, </span>but can you say that in a context where it <span class="gemarra-regular">deals with sightings it excludes days? </span>The exclusionary term “and this” appears in the section discussing the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the <span class="it-text">zav</span>, in the context of which it mentions sightings and not days, and therefore when it excludes something from these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> and limits them to specific cases, it will exclude it from being associated with sightings.
The Gemara returns to the subject of classifying an ox as innocuous or forewarned: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>type of ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned? Any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">about which </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified </span>that it gored on <span class="gemarra-regular">three days </span>is forewarned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it reverts to its former <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>status <span class="gemarra-regular">if children pet it and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not gore; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Shimon says: A forewarned </span>ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">about which </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified </span>that it gored <span class="gemarra-regular">three times, and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">three days only with regard to reversals, </span>meaning that in order for an ox to revert to innocuous status, the ox must refrain from goring on three separate days. Each of these additional views on this subject combine aspects of both of the opinions mentioned in the mishna, those of Rabbi Yehuda and those of Rabbi Meir.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda concerning </span>the criteria for deeming an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, as Rabbi Yosei concedes to his </span>opinion on this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir concerning </span>the criteria for reverting the status of an animal to <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, as Rabbi Yosei concedes to his </span>opinion on that issue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say </span>the reverse, that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir concerning </span>the criteria for deeming an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, as Rabbi Shimon concedes to his </span>opinion on this issue <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda concerning </span>the criteria for reverting the status of an ox to <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, as Rabbi Shimon concedes to his </span>opinion on that issue. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">replied to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei’s analysis [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nimmuko</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is with him, </span>i.e., it is sound.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised </span>before the Sages: The <span class="gemarra-regular">three days that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the context of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the testimony needed to assign the status of forewarned to an ox, are they needed in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to render the ox forewarned, or </span>are they needed in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to forewarn the man </span>who owns the ox, to inform him that he needs to take precautions to keep it from causing further harm?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>between the two possibilities? The Gemara answers: The practical difference is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where three groups of witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to the court <span class="gemarra-regular">on one day, </span>each testifying about a separate instance of goring caused by the ox on three separate days. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that their testimony serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">render the ox forewarned </span>by determining that it gored on three separate days, then in this case the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has been classified </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>on the basis of their testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that their testimony serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarn the man,</span> the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been classified </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>on the basis of this testimony since the owner heard all of the testimony on a single day. This enables <span class="gemarra-regular">him to say: </span>It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">testified against me; </span>and therefore his ox will not be deemed forewarned until he has been issued warnings over the course of three separate days. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, is the solution to the dilemma raised above?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox does not become forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testify against it in the presence of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner and in the presence of a court. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they testified against it in the presence of a court but not in the presence of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner but not in the presence of a court, it does not become forewarned until they testify against it in the presence of a court and in the presence of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner.</span>
Furthermore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified against </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>incident of goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>other witnesses testified against it <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>incident, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>other witnesses testified against it <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>incident, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are three </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies here, but </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">one with regard to rendering </span>their statements as <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring testimony.</span>
Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the first set </span>of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">is determined to be conspiring </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two testimonies </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>that claim that the ox gored, and the owner must pay for half the cost of the damage in each case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from having to pay the full cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the conspiring witnesses are <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from paying the owner what he would have had to pay were their testimony accepted and his ox deemed forewarned, as they testified only concerning the first incident of goring, and the ox would not have been deemed forewarned on the basis of this testimony alone. And similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the second set </span>of witnesses was also <span class="gemarra-regular">determined to be conspiring </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is one testimony </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>that claims that the ox gored, the third. At this point too, the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from having to pay the full cost of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the conspiring witnesses are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from having to pay the owner the full cost of the damage.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the third group </span>of witnesses was also <span class="gemarra-regular">determined to be conspiring witnesses, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the witnesses become <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The third group is liable to pay the owner of the animal the payment for half the cost of the damage they tried to make him pay for the third incident of goring, and all three groups must share in the payment of the other half of the damage for the final incident that they tried to charge him for by classifying his ox as forewarned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And concerning this it is stated: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired to do </span>unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19).
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that the purpose of the testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">to render the ox forewarned, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> presented in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well, </span>as according to this opinion it can be said that all of the witnesses came on the same day at the behest of the alleged victim of the third incident, and therefore they were all certainly aware of each other’s testimony. Consequently, the first set of witnesses shares in the responsibility for the testimony of the last group, as they are all co-witnesses in the effort to have the ox rendered forewarned. 

Daf 24b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the witnesses came <span class="gemarra-regular">to forewarn the man, </span>to caution him to safeguard his animal from causing harm, then they must have come on three separate days. And if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let these first </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Did we know that after three days these </span>other witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were going to come to testify about </span>the animal? Therefore, it must be that the case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is one where the three groups of witnesses all came on the same day, and if that is so, the purpose of the testimony must be to render the ox forewarned.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: I recited </span>this <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Kahana and he replied to me </span>in response to this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does it work out well </span>to say that they are coming <span class="gemarra-regular">to render the ox forewarned? </span>Even in a case where all of the witnesses arrive in court on the same day, <span class="gemarra-regular">let these last </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: From where were we to know that all </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">standing in court came to testify about the ox? We came to make this person liable </span>to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>his animal allegedly caused, but we are not responsible for the attempt to make him pay the full cost of the damage for the third incident.
The Gemara answers: It must be that the case concerns a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the different groups of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>observed <span class="gemarra-regular">signalin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to each other, and therefore it is clear that they were aware of each other’s testimony and that they came to the court for this purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">came in succession,</span> one following the other, and therefore it is clear that the latter witnesses are aware of the former.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>In this case the witnesses said that they were <span class="gemarra-regular">acquainted with the owner of the </span>goring <span class="gemarra-regular">ox but </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar with the ox </span>itself. This indicates that they were coming to court to render the ox forewarned, as the witnesses are not able to identify the goring ox and they would not be able to hold its owner liable to pay for half the cost of the damage, as this payment is paid only from the proceeds of the sale of the animal. Therefore, the only purpose of their testimony would be to hold the owner liable to pay the full cost of the damage for the third incident, as this payment is made from the owner’s superior-quality land.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if they were not familiar with the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">how could they render it forewarned? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said</span> to the animal’s owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">You have a goring o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among your cattle, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">you need to safeguard all of the cattle.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who incites another’s dog against another, </span>i.e., a third person, and he is injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who incited </span>the animal against him is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly exempt, </span>since he did not cause the damage directly and neither did his property; but <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the dog? </span>The Gemara explains the different sides of the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the owner of the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did I do to </span>the dog? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps we say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Since you were aware that if others incite your dog it is prone to </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">affected </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">incitement </span>and attacking, <span class="gemarra-regular">you ought not to have kept it </span>in your possession. Since you did, you are liable for the damage and the injuries it causes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>an ox reverts to its former <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>status <span class="gemarra-regular">if children pet it and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not gore. </span>It can be inferred from this that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it gores </span>when the children pet it, the owner would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage. An ox that gores because children pet it can be likened to one that gores because it was incited to do so, and nevertheless the mishna holds the owner liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Is it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if <span class="gemarra-regular">it gored </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? Perhaps </span>that is not what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means. It merely means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it gored it </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>revert to <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>status; but the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable for </span>any of the damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">that goring </span>because the children incited the animal to do so, and therefore nothing can be conclusively demonstrated from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara attempts to prove this point from another source: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a solution from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 76b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">incited a dog against another </span>person, or <span class="gemarra-regular">incited a snake against another </span>person, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What, is it not that the one who incited </span>the dog against him is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the dog </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the one who incited </span>the animal against him is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as well as the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">incites the dog of another against </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>nevertheless if <span class="gemarra-regular">he incited the dog against himself, </span>i.e., the dog bit the one who was inciting it to attack, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason </span>for this? Due to the principle that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who deviates </span>from normative behavior in his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">if another came along </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">and deviates </span>from the norm <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from liability. Since this individual deviated from the normative behavior and incited the dog against himself, the owner of the dog is not responsible for any damage the dog causes to him as a result, although generally speaking any time a dog bites it is in and of itself a deviation from its typical behavior and something for which its owner would normally be held liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Rava: It was stated in the name of Reish Lakish in accordance with your </span>opinion, that if anyone deviates from normative behavior in his actions, if another came along afterward and deviates from the norm with regard to the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is exempt from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two cows in the public domain, one prone </span>in the street <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>cow <span class="gemarra-regular">kicked </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prone </span>cow, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. But if the <span class="gemarra-regular">prone </span>cow kicked the <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>cow, its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The rationale for this is that since it is typical behavior for cows to walk in the public domain and the prone cow deviated from this behavior, even if the walking cow also acted atypically and kicked the prone cow, the owner is exempt from liability.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Pappa: That is not in accordance with my opinion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have held </span>the owner of the walking cow <span class="gemarra-regular">liable in that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">we say to him </span>on behalf of the prone cow: It is true <span class="gemarra-regular">that you have the right to tread on me </span>in the public domain but <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not have the right to kick me, </span>and therefore Rava’s and Reish Lakish’s opinions are not exactly the same.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that causes damage </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, mentioned in an earlier mishna (15b) that listed animals that are forewarned? If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">gored, pushed, bit, squatted </span>upon, or <span class="gemarra-regular">kicked </span>another animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>the owner is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>if the ox was innocuous, but if it acted while <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon says: </span>He must pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and the Rabbis say: </span>He must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage,</span> as in any other case classified as Goring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon said to the </span>Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">If in a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was lenient with regard to </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and with regard to Trampling, </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, as </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <span class="gemarra-regular">strict</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to these </span>forms of damage if they occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, requiring him <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>then in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was strict with regard to</span> cases of damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>requiring the owner liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay for half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, is it not right that we </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be strict with regard to this </span>form of damage if it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party to likewise require the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage?</span>
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Although there is an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference being applied here, still <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> cannot be stricter with the inference than it is with the case that serves as the source of the inference. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>classified as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, so too, </span>for damage classified as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party he is liable to pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>If that is your opinion, then <span class="gemarra-regular">I as well</span>

Daf 25a

<span class="gemarra-regular">will not derive an inference </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring from </span>a different case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring. I will </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">derive an inference </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring from Trampling: And if in a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was lenient with regard to </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>as the owner is exempt from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <span class="gemarra-regular">strict</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>requiring him to pay half the cost of the damage, then in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strict with regard to </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party as the animal’s owner is obligated to pay the full cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that we </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>equally <span class="gemarra-regular">strict with regard to </span>damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>and require payment of the full cost of the damage in this case as well?
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Here as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sufficient </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source, </span>and therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>classified as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, so too, </span>for damage classified as Goring <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party he will be liable to pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>as ultimately your inference still depends on the fact that for Goring in the public domain one pays half the cost of the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon does not accept </span>the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that cannot be, as the principle that begins with: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>an aspect <span class="gemarra-regular">of Torah law, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Sages said that one of the ways in which the Torah may be interpreted is <span class="gemarra-regular">by an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference. How </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">so? </span>It is written (Numbers 12:14): <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord said to Moses: If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days? </span>Let her be shut up seven days outside the camp, and after that she shall be brought in again,” and therefore, using <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference it can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence </span>reprimanded her, she should hide in shame for <span class="gemarra-regular">fourteen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why was Miriam banished for only seven days? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sufficient </span>for the conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerged from the </span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like the source </span>of the inference. Consequently, this principle is mandated by the Torah itself.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>this principle completely <span class="gemarra-regular">refutes </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, leaving no <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from it. But <span class="gemarra-regular">where it does not </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">refute </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is sufficient. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to Miriam, the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days during which she deserved to be banished from the camp due to the rebuke <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Divine Presence were not written, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>those days plus additional days, adding up to a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">fourteen, </span>and then the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">removed seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">and left seven </span>days intact. Consequently, the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference was effective with regard to the seven days during which she was banished from the camp.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is written </span>explicitly in the Torah with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of Goring in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and brings an additional </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, forming </span>a payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. If you interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> employing the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, </span>to reduce the payment to half the cost of the damage, this completely <span class="gemarra-regular">refutes </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, as no <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would be derived from the inference; the initial payment for half the cost of the damage was written explicitly in the Torah. Consequently, in this case, Rabbi Tarfon does not employ the principle: It is sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>understand this matter? How do they respond to Rabbi Tarfon’s reasoning? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days during which Miriam had to be banished due to the reprimand she received <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Divine Presence </span>are in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let her be shut up seven days.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> This indicates that the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is not required to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the seven days she was banished, as it would have added only the extra seven days. This means that according to the Rabbis, there is a source in the Torah that the principle: It is sufficient, is employed even when it refutes the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference completely.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon </span>say about that reasoning? The Gemara answers: He would say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let her be shut up </span>seven days,” is necessary to teach us the basic fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> according to the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient </span>for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what would <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>say in response? The Gemara answers: They would point out that <span class="gemarra-regular">a different verse is written </span>about Miriam: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Miriam was shut up </span>outside the camp seven days” (Numbers 12:15). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon </span>respond to that? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that we interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> according to the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, even generally, </span>and not only in this specific case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this point is necessary so that <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not say: Here </span>the principle: It is sufficient, is employed <span class="gemarra-regular">due to respect for Moses, but generally </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>done. This verse therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: </span>Is the fundamental principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source, actually accepted by all authorities? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who does not interpret </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, even though </span>it is a case where the principle <span class="gemarra-regular">does not refute </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference completely. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that the <span class="gemarra-regular">semen of a man who experiences</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a gonorrhea-like discharge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> imparts ritual impurity by someone carrying it as well as by coming into contact with it, just as the actual gonorrhea-like discharge does? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a logical </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derivation </span>from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>spittle, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>when coming <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a person who is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>when coming <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>someone like a <span class="it-text">zav</span> who is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, is it not logical that </span>semen, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>when coming <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>someone who is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, should be impure </span>when coming <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>someone who is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>this derivation and applies it <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>discussing ritual impurity imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by contact </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>discussing impurity imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by carrying. And why </span>is this the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective in </span>teaching that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">by contact </span>alone, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the semen of a pure man, and the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, is effective </span>by limiting the scope of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> from imparting ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">by carrying. </span>Since the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does not formulate his derivation in this manner, it appears that he rejects the principle: It is sufficient, in all situations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">was not necessary </span>to teach that the seminal emission of the <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">by contact, as it is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">no less </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>if it had come from <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>so the inference was necessary only to teach that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts impurity by carrying, this is not correct. In fact, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary </span>to teach this point, as it may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>in the verse: “If there be among you any man that is not clean because of something that <span class="gemarra-regular">happens to him by night” </span>(Deuteronomy 23:11), this means that a seminal emission is ritually impure if it came from <span class="gemarra-regular">someone who </span>had something <span class="gemarra-regular">happen to him, </span>and this <span class="gemarra-regular">causes him </span>to experience the emission, but the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding this </span><span class="it-text">zav</span>, who did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have something <span class="gemarra-regular">happen to him </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">cause him </span>to experience the emission, but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather another matter, </span>i.e., his gonorrhea-like condition, <span class="gemarra-regular">caused him </span>to experience the emission. Consequently, it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is incorrect.
Abaye responded: In the verse “something that happens to him by night,” <span class="gemarra-regular">is it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: But not another matter? </span>This limiting clause is not written in the verse, and therefore the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts ritual impurity by contact can be understood from the explicit verse in the Torah, and there is no need to derive it from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference. Therefore, the only function of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is to teach the halakha that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts impurity by carrying. Applying the principle: It is sufficient, would refute the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference completely, so there is no proof that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> would apply the principle in all circumstances.
Once the Gemara raised the issue, it clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> about whom <span class="gemarra-regular">you heard that he said: Semen of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imparts ritual impurity by carrying? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">not Rabbi Eliezer and not Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Semen of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imparts ritual impurity by contact but </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not impart ritual impurity by carrying; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">also imparts ritual impurity by carrying, as it is impossible </span>for semen to emerge <span class="gemarra-regular">without small drops of gonorrhea-like discharge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>accompanying it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says there </span>that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts ritual impurity by carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">only because it is impossible </span>for semen to emerge <span class="gemarra-regular">without small drops of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ziva</span> accompanying it. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if not for this </span>reason, the semen would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>impart ritual impurity by carrying, according to the opinions of both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the one who holds the opinion that the semen of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> imparts ritual impurity by carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna listing the sources of ritual impurity (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 1:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">Of a greater degree than </span>the ritual impurities listed previously in the mishna, i.e., the impurity of a creeping animal, semen, and one who contracted ritual impurity from a corpse, 

Daf 25b

are the <span class="gemarra-italic">ziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his spittle, and his semen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his urine, and the blood of a menstruating woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> all of which <span class="gemarra-regular">impart impurity both by touching and by carrying.</span>
The Gemara questions this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>here too the reason for the severity of ritual impurity of the semen is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed because it is impossible </span>for it to emerge <span class="gemarra-regular">without small drops of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ziva</span> accompanying it, but it is not due to the impurity of the semen itself. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>that would be <span class="gemarra-regular">so, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach it </span>in the list of bodily fluids <span class="gemarra-regular">along with, </span>meaning list it immediately following, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is different </span>about semen <span class="gemarra-regular">that he teaches it along with: His spittle? Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because its </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">comes from, </span>i.e., it is derived from, that of <span class="gemarra-regular">his spittle, </span>and therefore the semen itself imparts impurity by carrying, even if there would not be small drops of <span class="it-text">ziva</span> accompanying it.
The Gemara returns to the primary discussion concerning the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">does not apply </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>such application would <span class="gemarra-regular">not refute </span>the entire <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that a thick <span class="gemarra-regular">ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> can contract ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">from a corpse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is a logical derivation </span>based on an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as small </span>clay <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> into which even a finger cannot be inserted because of their narrow opening and <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>despite contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">become impure </span>if present under one roof <span class="gemarra-regular">with a corpse, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mat, which can become impure </span>due to contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, will </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">become impure </span>if present under one roof <span class="gemarra-regular">with a corpse?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">cites this </span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>to derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the mat becomes ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">with impurity </span>that lasts until <span class="gemarra-regular">nightfall, </span>as it would if it were to come into contact with a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to derive that the mat becomes ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">with impurity </span>that lasts for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days, as would any vessel that contracted ritual impurity from a corpse. <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>does he do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>instead that the <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective </span>in deriving the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the mat can contract ritual impurity from a corpse, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>rendering it <span class="gemarra-regular">impure until nightfall, </span>and also say that the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is sufficient, is effective </span>by limiting the scope of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the possibility that the mat would be rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">impure for seven </span>days.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Aḥa: This question <span class="gemarra-regular">was already raised </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Zekharya to Abaye, and Abaye said to him </span>in response: This <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> does not derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the mat through an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference from the case of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>. Rather, he <span class="gemarra-regular">derives it from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mat </span>that came into contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying: </span>The first derivation is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is susceptible to impurity imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal? And it is a logical derivation </span>based on an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as small vessels, which </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>despite contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>nevertheless become <span class="gemarra-regular">impure from </span>contact with the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal, is it not right that a mat, which </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">impure from the impurity of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, will </span>likewise become <span class="gemarra-regular">impure from </span>contact with the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal?</span>
The second derivation is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from where </span>is it derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">a mat </span>contracts impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse? </span>It is derived through a verbal analogy. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>impurity imparted by the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal, it is stated: </span>“Or <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment or leather” </span>(Leviticus 11:32), <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to </span>impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse it is stated: “A garment, or </span>anything made of <span class="gemarra-regular">leather” </span>(Numbers 31:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a creeping animal, a mat </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">impure from it, so too </span>with regard to the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a corpse, a mat </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">impure from it.</span>
The Gemara notes: It must be that the words “garment” and “leather” are <span class="gemarra-regular">free</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., those terms must be extraneous in their contexts, and the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy, as a verbal analogy that is based on otherwise extraneous terms cannot be logically refuted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Because if </span>these terms are <span class="gemarra-regular">not free, </span>the verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">can be refuted: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is unique <span class="gemarra-regular">about a creeping animal? </span>It is unique in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">a lentil-bulk </span>of a creeping animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a corpse, </span>whose <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are less strict <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">impure by means of </span>contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">a lentil-bulk </span>of a corpse but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather by means of </span>contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk? </span>Unless the terms are free, the analogy can be refuted.
The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed,</span> the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">are free. </span>The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, since </span>ritual impurity imparted by contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal is juxtaposed to </span>ritual impurity imparted by contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">semen, as it is written: </span>“And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a man from whom </span>semen <span class="gemarra-regular">is emitted” </span>(Leviticus 22:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and juxtaposed to that </span>verse is the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or a man who touches any creeping animal </span>which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written with regard to </span>the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it </span>shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of each can be derived from the other.
Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to a creeping animal? </span>The relevant <span class="it-text">halakha</span> could be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of seminal impurity. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that “garment” and “leather” were mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to render them free, </span>i.e., extraneous, but the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And still, </span>the terms “garment” and “leather” <span class="gemarra-regular">are free </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from one side </span>of the verbal analogy, because although the terms “garment” and “leather,” stated with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a creeping animal, are extraneous in their context, as the relevant <span class="it-text">halakha</span> could have been derived in another manner, those terms stated with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse are not extraneous in their context. <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says </span>that with regard to a verbal analogy that is <span class="gemarra-regular">free from </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one side, one can derive from it and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot refute </span>it logically; <span class="gemarra-regular">it is well. But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can derive </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verbal analogy of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">refute </span>it logically, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>It has already been established that the carcass of a creeping animal is stricter in some senses than a corpse.
The Gemara answers: The terms “garment” and “leather,” as stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse, are also free. Since </span>the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse is juxtaposed with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">semen, as it is written: “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, or a man from whom </span>semen <span class="gemarra-regular">is emitted” </span>(Leviticus 22:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written with regard to semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it” </span>(Leviticus 15:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to </span>impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Learn from it </span>that they are mentioned in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to render them free, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it is free from both sides.</span>
The Gemara questions this from a different angle: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says: Infer </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from it and interpret it according to its </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>This would mean that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a mat becomes impure from a corpse is derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a mat becomes impure from semen, but the details of that impurity, i.e., the length of the time it is impure, are interpreted according to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of impurity imparted by a corpse, for seven days. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says: Infer </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from it and </span>infer the details of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from it </span>as well, which would mean that the details of the impurity would also be interpreted according to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of impurity imparted by semen, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>According to the latter opinion, it should be concluded that just as the impurity imparted to a mat by the carcass of a creeping animal lasts only until nightfall, so too, a mat rendered impure by a corpse remains impure only until nightfall.
In response to this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This opinion does not lead to that conclusion, as there is a Torah edict indicating otherwise. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>(Numbers 31:24): <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day.” </span>This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">any ritually impure </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">that you render impure </span>due to contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with a corpse must </span>remain impure for a period of <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than seven </span>days. Therefore, since it has been inferred that the mat is susceptible to the impurity imparted by a corpse, it automatically falls into the same category of other items similarly rendered impure by a corpse and must remain impure for a period of at least seven days.
§ Up to this point, the Gemara discussed how to properly apply the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference to be like its source. It now returns to discussing the main subject of the mishna, which is the various views concerning Goring, the primary category of damage. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>one be held <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling </span>if these take place <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>with regard to damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, for which, </span>if it took place <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, according to the Rabbis one is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay only half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, yet </span>the owner of the animal is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>then with regard to damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>whose <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are more strict, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that </span>one should be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain?</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>with regard to Eating or Trampling (Exodus 22:4): <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it consumed in the field of another,” </span>meaning that one’s liability for this form of damage is limited to damage caused on the property of the injured party, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. </span>

Daf 26a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are we saying </span>that based on the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference one should have to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the damage caused in the public domain for Eating and Trampling? That would be false, as the verse indicating one’s liability to pay the full cost of the damage limits the application to damage caused in “the field of another.” <span class="gemarra-regular">We are saying</span> only that he should be liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of the damage there, just as with regard to Goring.
The Gemara rejects this as well: This is also incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to the payment of half the damages: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And divide its monetary value” </span>(Exodus 21:35). The use of the expression “its monetary value,” and not “the monetary value,” emphasizes that it is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">the price of this</span> ox that caused damage classified as Goring whose money will be divided, i.e., the owner of the ox will be obligated to pay half the cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the price of another, </span>i.e., not in other cases of damage caused by one’s ox.
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>one be held <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">only half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling </span>even if the incident took place <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party. This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference drawn <span class="gemarra-regular">from Goring, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>for damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>which is governed by a stricter <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as one is held <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage classified as Goring even if it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>yet one nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, then with regard to damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>which are governed by more lenient <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, as one is completely <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, is it not right that </span>he should have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>with regard to Eating and Trampling: “The best of his field and the best of his vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall pay” </span>(Exodus 22:4). The intent of the verse is to emphasize that the owner of the ox pays <span class="gemarra-regular">a proper, </span>meaning complete, amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">payment, </span>and not half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be held <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>at all with regard to damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the public domain. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>for damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, for which </span>one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>for incidents that took place <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, one is completely <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>then with regard to damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>which is governed by a more lenient <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as one is held <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the property of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that </span>one should be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt in the public domain?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>in reference to an innocuous ox: “And the carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">divide” </span>(Exodus 21:35), to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>with regard to the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, whether </span>the damage occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain or </span>whether it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property.</span>
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let a person</span> who inadvertently kills another be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay ransom. </span>This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the owner of an <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity, </span>i.e., pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, if his ox injures a person, is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay ransom </span>if it killed someone, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, who is liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity </span>if he injures another, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that he should be liable to pay ransom </span>if he were to kill him?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states </span>with regard to an ox killing a person: “He shall give for the redemption of his life <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever is imposed upon him” </span>(Exodus 21:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">“Upon him”: </span>This means upon the owner of an ox who kills a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not upon a person </span>who kills another.
The Gemara suggests the reverse derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that injured a person be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity.</span> This can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if a person, who is not obligated to pay ransom </span>if he kills someone, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity </span>if he injures another, then with regard to the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to pay ransom, is it not right that he should </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>with regard to this matter: “And if <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span>maims <span class="gemarra-regular">another” </span>(Leviticus 24:19), from which it can be derived that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies when a man harms another person <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>harms <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, </span>in the case of an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that tramples a child in the courtyard of the injured </span>party and kills the child, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the liability of the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay ransom? </span>The Gemara explains the different sides of the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is with regard to Goring? </span>Accordingly, just with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, once </span>an animal has gored <span class="gemarra-regular">two or three times </span>this becomes defined as <span class="gemarra-regular">its usual manner </span>and therefore it is deemed forewarned <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay ransom </span>in the event that it kills a person by an act classified as Goring, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too it is not different, </span>as with regard to the category of Trampling the owner is deemed forewarned from the start and he must therefore pay ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>should we say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>is more stringent, as Goring requires the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intent to cause damage, </span>and that is why the owner must pay ransom in the event of a death; but in a case of Trampling, where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no intent to cause damage, </span>the owner would be exempt from paying ransom?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into the courtyard of a homeowner without </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">permission, and it gored the homeowner and he died, the ox </span>is killed <span class="gemarra-regular">by stoning and the owner </span>of the ox is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>amount of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, </span>regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Tarfon.</span>
The Gemara proceeds to clarify: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an innocuous </span>ox the owner must also pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>amount of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says </span>that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox that killed a person <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>if the incident took place <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain? And he derived </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> And if in a case of Trampling, for which one is exempted entirely from liability when it occurs in the public domain, one must nevertheless pay the full ransom if the incident took place on the property of the injured party, with regard to Goring, for which one must pay half the ransom when it occurs in the public domain, is it not right that one should be obligated to pay full ransom for an incident that took place on the property of the injured party? <span class="gemarra-regular">Evidently, </span>it is clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a ransom </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said: </span>It is possible to explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived </span>his <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by Trampling: </span>And if in a case of Trampling, for which one is completely exempt from liability when it happens in the public domain, one pays the full cost of the damage done on the property of the injured party, with regard to Goring, for which one must pay half the ransom payment if the ox kills a person in the public domain, is it not right that one would certainly be obligated to pay the full ransom if the person was killed on his own property? According to this reasoning there is no indication that one pays a ransom payment in the case of a child that was killed by Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if this is the basis for Rabbi Tarfon’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">refute </span>it in this way: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>can be learned about ransom <span class="gemarra-regular">from damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by Trampling? These </span>same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to Fire; </span>nevertheless, there is no obligation to pay ransom when a person is killed by Fire, as was stated explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above (10a). Consequently, the attempt to derive an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference about ransom from Trampling is obviously flawed. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference can be <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed </span>articles caused by Trampling on the property of the injured party. One would be exempt for damage such as this if it were caused by Fire.
The Gemara responds to this challenge with a different one: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable about damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to concealed </span>articles caused by Trampling? It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that these </span>same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>but nevertheless there is no ransom paid if a person is killed by a pit. Consequently, an attempt to derive an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference about ransom from this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is obviously flawed. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference can be <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>by Trampling on the property of the injured party. One would be exempt for damage of this nature if it were caused by a pit.
The Gemara rejects this as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable about damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels </span>by Trampling? It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that these </span>same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire.</span> The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference can be <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed vessels </span>by Trampling. In this case, one would be liable for Trampling but exempt from liability for both Fire and Pit, so this can be the basis for the ransom payment, via the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference stated by Rav Shimi of Neharde’a. The Gemara rejects this as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable about damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to concealed vessels </span>by Trampling? It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that these </span>same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Man, </span>as a person is liable for damage to these items but does not pay ransom if he inadvertently kills another person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that since the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the ransom payment with regard to Goring cannot be deduced from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damages with regard to Trampling, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>his <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling, </span>and therefore it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that this is so. Consequently, in the case of a child trampled to death by Trampling while on his parents’ property, the owner of the animal must pay ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: So too, it is reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is </span>an obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling, as, if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived </span>his <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by Trampling, let </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">refute it </span>in this way: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable about <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by Trampling? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that these </span>same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to Trampling, </span>while there is no obligation to pay ransom in a case of Trampling. In other words, it would be possible to derive the obligation to pay a full ransom where a person was killed by the Goring of an innocuous ox while on the property of the victim only if there is also an obligation to pay ransom where the person was killed by Trampling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference must be <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling, </span>and therefore it may be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">evidently, there is </span>an obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Trampling? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it</span> that this is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>that of one <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the damage was <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentional or intentional, whether </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">awak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> while he caused the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">asleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he blinded another’s eye or broke vessels, he must pay the full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">He blinded another’s eye, </span>and presumably this is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the other example: <span class="gemarra-regular">Broke vessels. </span>From this it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>in the case of the broken vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one must pay for the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>he caused but he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the four types of indemnity, so too, </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he blinds another, yes, </span>he must pay for the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>he caused, but he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the four types of indemnity, </span>since he caused the injury while asleep or unintentionally. 

Daf 26b

With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one must pay the full cost of the damage in a case where there was no intent to cause damage, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiyya says, and similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states: “Wound for wound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petza taḥat patza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 21:25). This phrase is superfluous, as the Torah states elsewhere (see Leviticus 24:19) that one is liable to pay compensation when injuring another. This verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to render him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the unintentional </span>damage just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">for the intentional</span> damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">accident </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly.</span>
The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>indicate that one must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case </span>where he pays compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> caused by the injury. Consequently, it seems that that verse cannot also be the source of the principle derived by the school of Ḥizkiyya. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span> that the superfluous phrase is intended to teach only that, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse write: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Petza</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">befatza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which carries the same meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, is meant by the superfluous word <span class="it-text">taḥat</span> in the phrase “<span class="it-text">petza</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">taḥat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">patza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? </span>It indicates that we must <span class="gemarra-regular">derive two </span>conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from it: </span>That one is liable to pay for pain even in a case where he pays compensation for damage, and that he is liable for unintentional damage as he is for intentional damage, and for damage caused by accident as for damage caused willingly.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a stone lying in </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lap and</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">was unaware of it, and he arose and it fell </span>and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damages </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the full cost of the damage caused by the stone. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the four types of indemnity, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. With regard to Shabbat,</span> if the falling stone caused him to violate one of the prohibited categories of labor; for example, if the stone fell from a private domain to the public domain, he is exempt. The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah prohibited </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">planned, </span>constructive <span class="gemarra-regular">labo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> on Shabbat, and he did not plan to perform this labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to exile, </span>the punishment prescribed for one who unintentionally but negligently kills another, were this stone to kill someone he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as the incident is deemed accidental.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave</span> whose tooth was destroyed or eye was blinded by the stone, potentially enabling the slave to earn his freedom (see Exodus 21:26–27), this is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:25): <span class="gemarra-regular">If the master was a doctor and </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Paint </span>the lid of <span class="gemarra-regular">my eye </span>in order to heal it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded it </span>during the procedure, or if the slave requested from his master: <span class="gemarra-regular">Scrape my tooth </span>in order to heal it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked out </span>the tooth while scraping it, the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">has mocked the master, as he is emancipated </span>due to the act of the master himself.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>The slave is not emancipated in these cases because the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And destroy it” </span>(Exodus 21:26), from which it is derived that the slave is emancipated <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">intends to destroy </span>the eye or the tooth, but not if he intended to heal the slave. So too, in the case where a stone fell and accidentally blinded a slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth, according to the Rabbis the slave would be emancipated and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel he would not.
All of the above cases relate to situations where the individual did not know the stone was in his lap. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">aware of it but forgot about it and he arose and it fell,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to damages </span>he is certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> being that he is liable even if he was unaware of the stone. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the four types of indemnity,</span> here too he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as he did not intend to cause injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to exil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, as the verse states:</span> “One who <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>strikes a person mortally” (Numbers 35:11), indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>some previous <span class="gemarra-regular">awareness, and </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span>in fact previously <span class="gemarra-regular">aware </span>of the stone in his lap. The term “unwittingly” is employed to describe someone who possessed knowledge of the potential transgression then forgot about it. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt,</span> as this was not a planned, constructive labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis </span>applies.
In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he intended to throw </span>the stone, and he intended to throw it for a distance of only <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>instead he <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>it a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, as it went farther than he wanted it to go, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. With regard to Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> he is exempt, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we require planned, </span>constructive <span class="gemarra-regular">labo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> as a condition for liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to exil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> he is liable, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man lie not in wait” </span>(Exodus 21:13), which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>from the death penalty a situation where one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to throw </span>the stone for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he actually <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>it for <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis </span>applies.
And if <span class="gemarra-regular">he intended to throw </span>the stone <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>instead he <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. With regard to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he said </span>to himself when he threw the stone that he would be satisfied <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever it may land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he is liable, as he intended to throw it a distance of four cubits, which is the minimum necessary to violate the prohibited labor of carrying in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>throw the stone aimlessly but rather had selected a target that was eight cubits away, then he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable as he did not perform the precise planned, constructive labor that he had intended. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to exile, </span>the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man lie not in wait” </span>(Exodus 21:13), which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>from the death penalty a situation where one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to throw </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he actually <span class="gemarra-regular">threw </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis </span>applies.
§ Since the Gemara cited Rabba’s comments about various actions for which the perpetrator is liable with regard to certain matters but exempt with regard to others, the Gemara cites similar rulings: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">threw a vessel, </span>such as an earthenware jug, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a roof and another came </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">and broke i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a stic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> during its descent, the latter is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he broke a broken vessel, </span>meaning that once the vessel was thrown from the roof it was clear that it would be broken upon landing, and therefore it is considered as if it were already broken and the one who broke it while it was still in the air is not liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">threw a vessel from a roof and there were cushions or blankets belo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> so that if the vessel would land on them it would not break, and then <span class="gemarra-regular">another came and removed </span>the cushions or blankets, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the individual who threw the vessel went quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>it landed and <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>the cushions or blankets himself, and as a result the vessel shattered, the one who threw the vessel is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from liability even though the vessel broke as a consequence of his actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? At the time that he threw </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows were stopped, </span>i.e., what he did at the time he threw the vessel, which is an act comparable to the shooting of an arrow, did not have the capacity to break the vessel. Therefore, he is not viewed as having broken the vessel, and is exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">threw a child from a roof and another came </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">and impaled him on his sword </span>and the child died, the question of who is liable to receive the death penalty for killing the child is dependent upon <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dispute between Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and the Rabbis. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">ten people beat </span>a victim <span class="gemarra-regular">with ten sticks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>they did so <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously or sequentially, they are all</span>

Daf 27a

<span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is impossible to sentence any one of them to death since no one person killed the victim and there is no death penalty for partially killing a person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: </span>If they beat him <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially the last one </span>to beat him is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the death of the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he brought </span>the victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death closer. </span>So too, in this case, although the first one threw the child, the one to impale him on his sword was the one to hasten his death, and therefore according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira he would be liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara discusses a similar scenario: If one threw a child from a roof and a forewarned <span class="gemarra-regular">ox came </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">and impaled </span>the child <span class="gemarra-regular">on its horns </span>and the child died, the question of whether or not the owner of the ox is liable to pay ransom is dependent upon <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael, son of </span>Rabbi <span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall give for the redemption of his life” </span>(Exodus 21:30), indicates that he must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the injured </span>party, i.e., the one who was killed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: </span>He must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the one responsible for the damage. </span>Since the child that was thrown off the roof had no monetary value at the time he was gored by the ox, as it was as if he were already dead, the Rabbis would exempt the owner of the ox from paying ransom. According to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, the owner of the ox must pay his own value to the family of the victim.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says</span> another similar <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: If a man <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from a roof and </span>while falling <span class="gemarra-regular">was inserted into a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the force of the fall, but he did not have the intention to engage in sexual intercourse, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the four types of indemnity. And if </span>this woman was <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span> waiting for him to perform levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not acquired </span>her as his wife through this act of intercourse. This is true even though a levirate marriage is ordinarily effected through sexual intercourse, even if unintentional, i.e., if he thought she was someone else. Nevertheless, since in this case he did not intend to engage in intercourse at all, the levirate marriage is not effected.
The Gemara explains: What are the four types of indemnity that he is liable to pay? <span class="gemarra-regular">He is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage, for the pain, for the medical costs, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">for the loss of livelihood. But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable to pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, as we learned </span>in a mishna (86a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One is not liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for humiliation unless he intends </span>to humiliate the injured party, and that was certainly not the case in this situation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says </span>another, similar <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from a roof due to an atypical wind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such that it could not have been anticipated in advance that he would fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>while falling <span class="gemarra-regular">he caused damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and humiliated </span>the injured party, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the damage </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">the four types of indemnity, </span>as he did not intend to fall. If he fell <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a typical wind and caused damage and humiliated </span>the injured party while falling, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the four types of indemnity, </span>as his fall was caused by negligence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>as he did not intend to fall. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he tumble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> while falling so he could fall on this person in order to protect himself from the impact with the ground, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for humiliation as well, </span>because although he did not intend to cause shame he did intend to land on the person.
The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one is exempt from paying compensation for humiliation unless he intended to strike his victim is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the fact that it is stated: “And she extended her hand” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">do I not know that she took </span>hold of something? Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when further on in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And she took </span>him by his genitals”? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that one who intends to cause damage, even if he does not intend to humiliate </span>the injured party, is nevertheless liable to pay compensation for humiliation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>a hot <span class="gemarra-regular">coal over another’s hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the latter was burnt and <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the one who placed the coal is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> because the victim should have removed the coal from himself, and the one who placed it there did not need to assume that the victim might not remove it. If he placed the coal <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">garment and </span>the garment <span class="gemarra-regular">was burnt, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage, as it is possible that the one whose garment was burnt thought to sue the one who placed the coal on his clothes for the cost of the garment, and that is why he did not bother to remove it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: We have learned both </span>of these rulings through intimation in <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> elsewhere. With regard to the case of the coal placed <span class="gemarra-regular">over his heart,</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 76b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">held another in a fir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in water, and </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is unable to extricate himself from there and he dies </span>as a result, the one who attacked him is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive the death penalty as a murderer. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed him into fire or into the water, and </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to extricate himself from there but he dies </span>anyway, the one who attacked him is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from the death penalty. The case of one who places a coal on another’s chest is similar to the one where he pushes the victim into the fire or the water in a situation where the victim has the ability to escape.
With regard to the case of one who placed a coal on <span class="gemarra-regular">the garment </span>of another, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (92a): If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Tear my garment, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Break my jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the other person does so, the latter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> for the damage. But if one said to another: Tear my garment <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that</span> you will be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from all liability, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span> It is therefore clear that even when one is granted permission by the owner of an item to damage it, that does not grant him an exemption from liability for the damage caused unless that exemption was stated explicitly. Consequently, in a case where the owner did not grant permission, the one who caused the damage is certainly liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raises a dilemma </span>in summation of this discussion: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed a coal over the heart of </span>another’s Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>and the slave died as a result, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the body of the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to the body </span>of any other person and therefore the assailant would be exempt from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>owned by the master and therefore the assailant would be liable? Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say</span> that the body of the slave is <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to the body </span>of any ordinary person, as the slave had the ability to remove the coal from himself and therefore the assailant would be exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where he placed the coal on the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox?</span>
After raising the dilemma Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolves it: </span>The body of <span class="gemarra-regular">the slave is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to the body </span>of any other person, as the slave possesses an intellect and should have the sense to remove the coal from himself, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox is comparable to </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
We learned in the Mishnah: 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and stumbles on it and breaks it, </span>the other person is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for what he broke. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the one who stumbled <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damaged by </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">began </span>its presentation of the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>stating: In the case of one who places a <span class="it-text">kad</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and ended </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>stating: The owner of the <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span> is liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>this interchanging of the words <span class="it-text">kad</span> and <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span> in a mishna (31b) <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: </span>If two people were walking down the street, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one coming with his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that one coming with his </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this one’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was broken by that one’s </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>the one holding the beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Here too the mishna changed its wording, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">began </span>its statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ended </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>this in another mishna (115a) <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came with his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came with his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of honey, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of honey, </span>which is more valuable, <span class="gemarra-regular">cracked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">poured out his wine and saved the honey </span>by collecting it <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>his vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>receives <span class="gemarra-regular">reimbursement only </span>for his trouble, and he cannot claim the value of the wine that he poured out since the owner of the honey did not tell him to do so. Here too the mishna changed its wording, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">began </span>its statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span> of honey <span class="gemarra-regular">and ended </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span> of honey.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>These examples show that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the two words are used interchangeably. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>does this make <span class="gemarra-regular">a difference? </span>This makes a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">for buying and selling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If a customer asks for a <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span>, intending a large vessel, and the seller gives him a <span class="it-text">kad</span>, which is a smaller vessel, the buyer cannot claim that he did not receive the item he asked for.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where this is relevant? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a locale where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not refer to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor do they refer to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and a <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span> is understood to be referring to a larger vessel, clearly one who asks for a <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span> does not wish to buy a <span class="it-text">kad</span>, as people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not call it </span>that.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that they are equivalent terms with regard to a locale <span class="gemarra-regular">where most </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">call a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., most people use the term <span class="it-text">kad</span> for the smaller vessel and the term <span class="it-text">ḥavit</span> for the larger one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there are also </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who call a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>not distinguishing between the two terms. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority </span>and the seller and the buyer must accept this distinction, 

Daf 27b

the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not follow the majority with regard to monetary matters, </span>and in cases of uncertainty the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
§ The mishna teaches concerning the vessel placed in the public domain: If <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stumbled on it and broke it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>Although this happened in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should examine </span>the road <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then continue <span class="gemarra-regular">walking.</span>
The Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav said in the name of Rav: </span>The ruling of the mishna is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> one who placed not just one barrel in the road, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">filled the entire public domain with barrels, </span>blocking the path. Since the public domain belongs to everyone, a pedestrian is entitled to traverse the road even if it necessitates breaking the vessels. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says:</span> The ruling of the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught with regard to </span>a case where he broke it in <span class="gemarra-regular">the dark. </span>Therefore, he could not have avoided breaking the barrel by examining the road in front of him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The ruling of the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught with regard to </span>a case where the barrel was placed at <span class="gemarra-regular">the corner </span>of the road, and so the pedestrian could not have seen it, as he rounded the corner, before stumbling on it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: The mishna is precise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only according to either </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel or </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>but not that of Rav. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>the mishna is explained <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, what </span>is the reason it refers <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled </span>on the barrel? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if he broke </span>the barrel intentionally he should not be liable to pay, as the owner of the barrel had no right to block the public road.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava </span>in defense of Rav’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same is true even if he broke </span>the barrel intentionally. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he wants to teach </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause: And if he incurred damage due to </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable</span> to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. As </span>this ruling applies <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically when he stumbled, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he broke</span> the barrel intentionally and incurred damage in the process, the owner of the barrel is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to compensate him. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Although the pedestrian had the right to break the barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is he who damaged himself,</span> by not being careful while breaking it. Therefore, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled. </span>Accordingly, the mishna’s wording is precise according to Rav’s explanation as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what they say in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Ulla, </span>in explanation of the mishna: Even if the barrel is clearly visible, one who stumbles on it is exempt from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">because the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of people is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to examine the roads, </span>as they assume that the road is unobstructed. Therefore, one who breaks an item placed in the road as a result of not watching is not liable to pay restitution.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident in Neharde’a </span>where a pedestrian stumbled on a jug in an open area and broke it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel deemed him liable </span>to pay for the damage. A similar incident took place <span class="gemarra-regular">in Pumbedita, and Rava deemed </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Shmuel </span>ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his halakhic </span>opinion that the exemption stated in the mishna refers specifically to a case where one stumbles in the dark, as otherwise he is liable for breaking the barrel, since he should have examined the road. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, shall we say that he holds in accordance with Shmuel’s </span>opinion that one who breaks an item in the public domain is exempt from paying for it only if it was dark?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>That inference is not necessary, as this incident <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">the corner where </span>there was an olive <span class="gemarra-regular">press [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">de’atzera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where it is known that people put their jugs down while waiting for oil. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they were acting with permission, </span>a pedestrian <span class="gemarra-regular">should examine </span>the road <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then continue <span class="gemarra-regular">walking.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda sent </span>the following question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that when one strikes another, humiliating him, the judges determine liability according to the following formula: <span class="gemarra-regular">For kneeing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rekhuva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> him, he must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">for kicking, five; and for punching [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">velisnokeret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> him, <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For </span>hitting him with <span class="gemarra-regular">the handle of a hoe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for </span>hitting him with <span class="gemarra-regular">the top [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ulkofina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a hoe, what </span>amount is one liable to pay him?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him </span>the following response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you collecting a fin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where judges are not authorized to collect fines? <span class="gemarra-regular">Tell me how the incident itself </span>transpired.
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him </span>in response: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain cistern belonging to two </span>people whose arrangement was to alternate its use so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every day one of them would draw </span>from it in turn. It happened that <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them came and was drawing</span> water <span class="gemarra-regular">on a day that was not his </span>turn. His co-owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is my day </span>to draw, not yours. His colleague <span class="gemarra-regular">did not pay attention to him. </span>The person whose turn it was therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">took the handle of a hoe </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">struck</span> the person who was stealing his water, who then sued for damages.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In that case, he was right to do so, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">hit him </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred times with the hoe. Even according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not take justice into his own </span>hands but should go to court, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there would be <span class="gemarra-regular">a loss</span> involved if no immediate action is taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may take justice into his own </span>hands.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: A person may not take justice into his own </span>hands, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: A person may take justice into his own </span>hands.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where there is </span>an imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">loss </span>that will be suffered if the injured party does not take action, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that a person may take justice into his own </span>hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is no </span>imminent <span class="gemarra-regular">loss </span>that will be suffered. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not take justice into his own </span>hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">because since there is no loss, he should go before the judge </span>to have him enforce the law. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may take justice into his own </span>hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he is acting lawfully, </span>as he is clearly in the right, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not trouble </span>himself to go before the judge to have him enforce the law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raises an objection </span>to Rav Yehuda’s opinion based on a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Bag Ba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Do not enter another </span>person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>secretly <span class="gemarra-regular">to take what is </span>rightfully <span class="gemarra-regular">yours without permission, lest you appear to him as a thief </span>trying to steal his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, break his teeth, </span>i.e., take it by force, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: I am taking what is mine. </span>Evidently one may take justice into his own hands.
Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 28a

You can keep this question <span class="gemarra-regular">to yourself, </span>as it poses no difficulty at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Bag Bag </span>states <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual </span>opinion in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis disagree with him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai says </span>an alternative response to Rav Kahana’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Break his teeth? </span>It means sue him <span class="gemarra-regular">in judgment.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the subsequent statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say to him, </span>is inaccurate. It <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they, </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him. </span>Likewise, the wording: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am taking what is mine, </span>is inaccurate. Since it is the court who makes this statement, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is taking what is his. </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>for Rav Yehuda’s version of the response.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an alternative proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion. It is stated in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that climbed on the back of another </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to kill it, and the owner of the </span>ox on the <span class="gemarra-regular">bottom came and removed his </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">on top </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fell and died, </span>the owner of the ox on the bottom is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the dead ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the attacker is <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no loss </span>to the owner of the bottom ox, since even if the owner of the ox on the bottom does not remove his ox, he will eventually receive full restitution from the owner of the belligerent ox? Yet he is exempt from paying restitution for causing the death of the belligerent ox. Evidently, he had the right to take justice into his own hands.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the attacker is <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a loss </span>for the owner of the ox on the bottom if he does not save it, since the owner of an innocuous ox pays for only half the damages resulting from his ox’s attack.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If, instead of removing his own ox, the owner of the ox on the bottom <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed the one on top and it died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And if </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> He is defending his property so as not to incur a loss.
The Gemara answers: He is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because he should have removed </span>his ox from underneath the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not remove it. </span>Instead, he pushed the belligerent ox and caused it to die. Although one may take justice into his own hands, if he damages another person’s property when he could have protected his own property in a harmless manner he is liable.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who fills another’s courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with jugs of wine and jugs of oil, the owner of the courtyard may break </span>his way through them <span class="gemarra-regular">and exit </span>his courtyard or he <span class="gemarra-regular">may break </span>his way through them <span class="gemarra-regular">and enter </span>his courtyard. Since the one who put the jugs there had no right to do so, the owner of the courtyard may take justice into his own hands. This is apparently the ruling even where there is no loss involved to the owner of the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>in response that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained as follows: The owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may break </span>the jugs <span class="gemarra-regular">and exit to court, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">may break </span>the jugs <span class="gemarra-regular">and enter </span>his house <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring </span>proof of <span class="gemarra-regular">his rights,</span> i.e., documents proving that the courtyard belongs to him. Since by refraining from doing so he would sustain a loss, he may break the jugs when exiting and entering. He may not take justice into his own hands beyond this extent. Therefore, no proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion can be inferred from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an alternative proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Hebrew slave </span>who had his ear <span class="gemarra-regular">pierced </span>with an awl to extend his tenure as a slave, but <span class="gemarra-regular">whose days </span>of servitude <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">ende</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with the arrival of the Jubilee Year; <span class="gemarra-regular">and his master is urging [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesarhev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him to leave </span>but he insists on remaining; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">and inflicted an injury on him </span>in the process of forcing him out, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>from paying for this injury?
To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “You shall take no ransom…that he should return” </span>(Numbers 35:32). Although this verse is referring to the prohibition against an unintentional killer paying a ransom instead of going to a city of refuge, this verse is also interpreted to mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall take no ransom for </span>a Hebrew slave who is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>to his family. In other words, if the slave refuses to return to his family and is injured in the process of his eviction, he does not receive compensation. This seems to indicate that the master may take justice into his own hands even for a matter that involves no loss to him.
The Gemara responds to this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a slave </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and consequently, if he remains a slave, his master will sustain a loss. Therefore, it is permitted for the master to take justice into his own hands and evict the slave by force.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until now he did not steal, and now he will </span>begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">steal? </span>Why would the master be worried about this just when the slave’s tenure ends? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until now, </span>while he was still a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">the awe of his master was upon him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so he did not steal from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that he may go free <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have the awe of his master upon him, </span>and the master is therefore worried that he might steal from him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</span> an alternative explanation: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a slave whose master provided a Canaanite maidservant to hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> as a wife and he wishes to remain with her. <span class="gemarra-regular">Until now, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him to engage in sexual intercourse with her, <span class="gemarra-regular">but now </span>that he is free, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for him to do so. In this case, his master may evict him forcefully, assuming the role of an emissary of the court, to prevent him from violating the prohibition. Therefore, this is not considered taking justice into his own hands.
The Gemara suggests a proof for Rav Yehuda’s opinion from the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places a jug in the public domain and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and stumbles on it and breaks it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>It may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>he is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">is that he stumbled on it. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">broke it </span>intentionally, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>This indicates that one may not take justice into his own hands.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: </span>That is not a proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true even if he broke </span>the barrel intentionally. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he wants to teach </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause: </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if he incurred damage due to </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable</span> to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damages. As </span>this ruling applies <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically when he stumbled, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he broke</span> the barrel intentionally and incurred damage in the process, the owner of the barrel is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to compensate him. Although the pedestrian had the right to break the barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is he who damaged himself, </span>by not being careful while breaking it. Therefore, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which relates to the case of a woman who, during a fight between her husband and another man, grabs the other man’s genitals: The verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then you shall cut off her hand” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:12), should not be taken literally; rather, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution. What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she cannot save </span>her husband from his attacker <span class="gemarra-regular">by a means other </span>than grabbing the attacker’s genitals, and nevertheless she is punished? This indicates that one may not take justice into his own hands. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the verse is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she can save</span> him <span class="gemarra-regular">by other means. </span>Otherwise she is exempt from paying restitution.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if she cannot save</span> him <span class="gemarra-regular">by other means, </span>is it possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? If so, instead of teaching </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the expression mentioned in the previous verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And extended her hand” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes an emissary of the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who is authorized to act in this manner and is therefore exempt from paying restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish and teach within </span>the case under discussion in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that the wife is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she can save </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">by another means. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she cannot save </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">by other means, she </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she can save </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">by other means. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she cannot save </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">by other means, her hand is rendered like an emissary of the court, and she is exempt.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof for Rav Yehuda’s opinion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 99b): In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a public thoroughfare would pass through </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">he appropriated it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the public an alternative route <span class="gemarra-regular">on the side </span>of his property, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the route <span class="gemarra-regular">that he has given </span>is the route <span class="gemarra-regular">that he gave </span>them, and they may use it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But his </span>property, which he appropriated, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not reached him, </span>i.e., he cannot appropriate it for his personal use since it was already in public use.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that a person may take justice into his own </span>hands, why does the owner of the field not have the right to close the thoroughfare? Since it is his property and he gave the public an alternative route, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him take a stick </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pazra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and sit </span>by the side of the road, preventing the public from passing through.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Rava: It is </span>a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, lest he give them a circuitous route. </span>Since the public has the right to pass through his field, as the Gemara will soon explain, the owner cannot appropriate their thoroughfare without giving the public a similar alternative route. Therefore, the Sages decreed that he cannot appropriate it without their consent, lest he provide an inadequate route.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">gave them a circuitous route. </span>If one in fact gives the public a straight path, he need not surrender his rights, and he may take justice into his own hands by blocking the original thoroughfare.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Any </span>route <span class="gemarra-regular">on the side </span>that the property owner might give them <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>necessarily considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a circuitous route, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is close for this </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is far for that </span>person. While some will benefit from the change, it will be detrimental for others.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why has his </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">not reached him? </span>If he cannot make the change, why can he not reclaim the path that he intended to turn over to the public? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him say to them: Take your </span>original route <span class="gemarra-regular">and give me </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>property, so that he will not lose both pieces of land.
The Gemara answers that he cannot reclaim it <span class="gemarra-regular">due to Rav Yehuda’s </span>statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a path that the masses establishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> as a public thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to destroy it </span>for them. Therefore, since the public already began using the alternative route, the owner cannot appropriate it from them.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an alternative proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of a field <span class="gemarra-regular">who left produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on one side </span>of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and poor people came and took from another side, this </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>produce are both considered <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if you say that a person may take justice into his own </span>hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>both considered <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Let him take a stick and sit </span>in his field on the side from which the poor people are taking produce without his permission, and let him warn them to take only from the side that he allocated.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>In terms of monetary law he can prevent them from taking <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> from the side that he did not allocate. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by the ruling of: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>produce are both considered <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means that they are considered <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to exempting </span>both portions of produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from tithes. </span>Just as the portion that the poor people took is exempt from tithes, so is the portion that he allocated initially.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and arose early in the morning </span>before anyone else took possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">and harvested it, </span>the one who renounces ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">individual fallen </span>grapes left for the poor [<span class="gemarra-italic">peret</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">incompletely formed clusters </span>of grapes left for the poor [<span class="gemarra-italic">olelot</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>clusters of grapes left for the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard (see Leviticus 19:9–10). <span class="gemarra-regular">But he is exempt from the </span>mitzva to <span class="gemarra-regular">tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. Likewise, in the above case the portion of the field that was allocated for <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> is exempt from tithes even after the owner reclaims it, as <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> is considered ownerless property in this regard.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">jug broke in the public domain and </span>another person <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped in the water </span>from the jug and was injured from the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured by the shards </span>of the broken jug, the owner of the jug is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In </span>a case where the owner of the jug acted <span class="gemarra-regular">with intent, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">without intent, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>that the owner of the jug is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only when the clothes of </span>the one who slipped <span class="gemarra-regular">were soiled by the</span> dirty <span class="gemarra-regular">water. </span>

Daf 28b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the person <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>was injured, the owner of the jug is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the ground </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused his injury, </span>not the jug or the water.
Rav Yehuda continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I stated this </span>ruling of Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel, he said to me: After all, we derive </span>the cases of damage caused by leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s stone, one’s knife, or one’s loa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s pit, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">read, </span>i.e., apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all of them </span>the inference of the Sages from the verse: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein” (Exodus 21:33), that the one who dug the pit is liable only if what incurred damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, but not a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey, but not vessels.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement applies with regard to </span>a situation where the person is <span class="gemarra-regular">killed, </span>i.e., if one fell into a pit and was killed, the person who dug it is exempt from paying restitution, since the verse refers exclusively to an animal that was killed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to damage, </span>the digger of the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay restitution for injury to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, but exempt </span>from paying restitution for damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for which no distinction between death and injury can be applied. Therefore, the ruling in the case of the jug that broke in the public domain should be the opposite. The owner of the jug is liable to pay restitution for injury caused to another, as Shmuel holds that he is liable even if the injury is caused by the impact with the ground, but that he is exempt from paying restitution for the damage done to the clothes of the one who slipped.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> how would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>answer this difficulty? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>presumption that liability for damage caused by one’s stone, knife, or load is derived from the category of Pit, thereby exempting him from payment for damage to vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he renounced ownership of them. But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not renounce ownership of them, it is </span>considered to be like any other case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his property </span>causes damage. Therefore, he is liable to pay for damage caused to the vessels.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Oshaya raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discussing Pit: It is derived from the verse: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fall therein” </span>(Exodus 21:33), that the digger is liable to pay restitution only if what incurred damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox but not a person, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey but not vessels. From here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox with its equipment fell into </span>a pit, and the ox was wounded <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the equipment <span class="gemarra-regular">broke; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey with its equipment </span>fell in, and the donkey was wounded <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the equipment <span class="gemarra-regular">tore, </span>then the one who dug the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>any injury sustained by <span class="gemarra-regular">the animal but exempt </span>from paying restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">equipment. To what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this similar? </span>It is similar <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his stone, or his knife, or his load that he left in the public domain, and they caused damage.</span>
The Gemara questions the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, it should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is similar to this, </span>since the cases of one’s stone, knife, or load are not mentioned in the Torah, but are derived from the case of Pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the wording should be emended as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is similar to this? </span>It is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his stone, or his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">knife, or his load that he left in the public domain, and they caused damage.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">dropped his flask on a stone </span>that was left in the public domain, breaking the flask, the owner of the stone is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause </span>of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav,</span> since it compares the cases of a stone, a knife, and a load to the case of Pit, and it does not distinguish between a situation in which he renounced ownership of them or one where he did not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which deems the owner of a stone in the public domain liable to pay restitution for the damage to the broken flask, is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult according to</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel. </span>According to him, the owner should be liable only for causing injury and not for damaging vessels.
The Gemara responds to this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself should pose a difficulty for you,</span> since <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>states that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for damage to vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the last clause </span>states that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav resolves </span>the contradiction according <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, and Shmuel resolves </span>it according <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav resolves </span>it according <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>Concerning what case does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rule that a stone, a knife, and a load are analogous to Pit, exempting their owner from liability for breakage to vessels caused by them? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he renounced ownership of them. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not renounce ownership of them he is liable. Therefore, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">dropped his flask on a stone </span>belonging to another person in the public domain, the owner of the stone is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage to the flask.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel resolves </span>the contradiction according <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you said </span>that the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s stone, one’s knife, and one’s load are similar to one’s pit, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda, who deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels by </span>falling into <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>that he dug, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore liable </span>in a case where someone <span class="gemarra-regular">dropped his flask on </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">stone </span>belonging to him, and the flask broke.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: They taught </span>that the owner of the stone is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pedestrian <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled on the stone and </span>the flask <span class="gemarra-regular">scraped against the stone </span>and broke. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled on the ground,</span> not the stone, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the flask consequently fell and <span class="gemarra-regular">scraped against the stone, </span>causing the flask to break, the owner of the stone is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, </span>who maintains that if damage is caused by two people and one of them is exempt from paying compensation, the other must pay the entire amount. Similarly here, since there is no liability for damage caused by stumbling on the ground, compensation should be collected from the owner of the stone.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>an alternative version of this discourse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Do not say </span>that it is only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pedestrian <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled on the ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the flask <span class="gemarra-regular">scraped against the stone, </span>causing the flask to break, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed liable, but </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stumbled on the ground and </span>the flask <span class="gemarra-regular">scraped against the stone, </span>causing the flask to break, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Rather, even </span>if the pedestrian <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled on the ground and </span>the flask <span class="gemarra-regular">scraped against the stone, </span>causing the flask to break, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that if someone’s jug broke in the public domain and one slipped in the water from the jug and was injured from the fall, or if he was injured by the shards of the broken jug, the owner of the jug is liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In a case where the owner of the jug acted <span class="gemarra-regular">with intent, </span>he is liable, and in a case where he acted without intent, he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which it is considered that he acted with <span class="gemarra-regular">intent?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">intends to lower </span>the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">off his shoulder </span>and accidentally breaks it, he is liable to pay for the damage he causes, according to Rabbi Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: By inference, does Rabbi Meir, </span>who is the anonymous first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable even </span>if the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">cracked </span>by itself? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Indeed, Rabbi Meir would deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable even </span>if he were holding <span class="gemarra-regular">the handle of </span>the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hand,</span> the optimal manner for holding it, and the handle snapped, causing the jug to fall and break, an accident clearly beyond his control.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is this so? Isn’t he the <span class="gemarra-regular">victim of circumstances beyond his control? And the Merciful One exempts </span>a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond his contro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> from punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to a betrothed young woman who is raped: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But to the young woman you shall do nothing” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:26).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>exemption from the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to damages </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even for circumstances beyond his control, <span class="gemarra-regular">but isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">jug broke and he did not remove its </span>shards, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">his camel </span>fell <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not stand it up, Rabbi Meir deems him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>they cause, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say </span>that

Daf 29a

he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis concede to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir in </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s stone, one’s knife, or one’s load, that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed them on top of his roof and they fell </span>as a result of being blown off <span class="gemarra-regular">by a typical wind, </span>i.e., one of ordinary force, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they caused damage, that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And Rabbi Meir concedes to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis in </span>the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">puts pitchers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kankanin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the roof in order to dry them, and they fell </span>as a result of being blown off <span class="gemarra-regular">by an atypical wind, </span>i.e., one of unusual force, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they caused damage, that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Evidently, even Rabbi Meir concedes that if one’s property causes damage due to circumstances completely beyond his control, he is exempt.
Accordingly, Abaye rejects Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, that he deems the owner of the jug liable even if he merely attempted to take it off his shoulder and it broke, and offers another explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said</span> that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to two </span>different situations. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree</span> with regard to a situation where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they disagree </span>with regard to a situation where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>in a situation where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall, with regard to </span>whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles, </span>thereby causing his jug to break, is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as his carelessness caused him to stumble. Therefore, he is liable to pay for damage caused by the shards of the jug, which broke as result of his stumbling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>in a situation where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall, with regard to one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounces ownership of his hazardous property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Presumably, the owner of the jug has no interest in keeping the shards, and it is considered as though he renounced his ownership of them. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable </span>to pay restitution for damage caused by it, despite the fact that it no longer belongs to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt </span>from paying restitution, as it does not belong to him anymore.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is this interpretation derived? It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches two </span>possible cases of damage, stating: Another person <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped in the water or was injured by the shards. This </span>case, slipping in the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>seemingly identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, injured by the shards. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>necessary to explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>Another person <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped in the water at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall, or was injured by the shards after </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall?</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>the dispute in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is with regard to two </span>situations, the dispute in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis must <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>relate <span class="gemarra-regular">to two </span>situations, as there too, two cases are mentioned, a case where one’s jug broke and a case where one’s camel fell. Apparently, the dispute is with regard to damage caused both at the time of the fall and after the fall. Rabbi Meir holds that one who stumbles and breaks his jug, causing damage to others, is considered negligent and that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable, and the Rabbis disagree with regard to both issues.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>with regard to the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s jug </span>broke, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>these circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">either at the time of the fall or after the fall. But </span>with regard to the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his camel </span>fell, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, you find </span>this circumstance <span class="gemarra-regular">after the fall, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when he renounces his ownership of the carcass, </span>not considering it worth keeping, <span class="gemarra-regular">but how can you find </span>these circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the fall? </span>How can the camel’s falling be considered to be due to the owner’s negligence, possibly rendering him liable to pay for injuries caused by it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa said: For example, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed through water, through the inundation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">serata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a river </span>that overflowed its banks, and it stumbled there, the owner was negligent, as he should not have gone this way.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If there was another route, </span>and he nevertheless chose this one, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent </span>according to all opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there was no other route, he is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> victim of circumstances beyond his control, </span>and he is exempt from liability according to all opinions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, you find </span>this circumstance in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled and the camel </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled on him. </span>In this case, the Sages engage in a dispute whether or not one who stumbles is considered negligent.
The Gemara asks: According to Abaye’s explanation that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to a situation where the owner of the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces ownership of his hazardous property </span>after it falls, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement that if the owner of the jug acted <span class="gemarra-regular">with intent </span>he is liable? What intention <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>after the jug fell and broke?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>It is a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he intends to acquire the shard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the broken jug, and he does not renounce his ownership of them. It is specifically in that case that Rabbi Yehuda holds him liable to pay for damage caused by the shards. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rav Ashi said: </span>It is a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he intends to acquire the shards.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: The dispute </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is with regard to a situation where the damage occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But after the fall, </span>according to this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agree </span>that the owner of the jug is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there Rabbi Meir, who deems </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since he did not remove the shards? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable? But aren’t there the Rabbis, who deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the explanation of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">At the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall?</span> It means <span class="gemarra-regular">even at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the dispute is referring to a situation where the damage occurred after the fall and also to a situation where it occurred at the time of the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with Abaye’s </span>explanation of the mishna. 

Daf 29b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>is with regard to a situation where the damage occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after the fall.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But at the time of </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fall, </span>according to this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agree </span>that the owner of the jug is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">But from the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan says later </span>(31a), with regard to another mishna in this chapter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say that the mishna is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, by inference </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir deems </span>one who stumbles <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages. Evidently, it is not unanimously agreed upon that he is exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>he say that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he is liable? But from the fact </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says later: Do not say that the mishna is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, by inference </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>is what Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: That </span>the circumstance in <span class="gemarra-regular">which the Rabbis deem one who renounces ownership of his hazardous propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt is </span>only the situation stated <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., where he stumbled, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is the victim of circumstances beyond his control. But in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> general </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property, they deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for damage caused by it.
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property </span>that he left in the public domain, there is a dispute between the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One said </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and one said </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who deems </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and the one who deems</span> him <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis?</span>
The Gemara responds: No; <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, everyone agrees </span>that one who renounces owner-ship over his hazardous property is liable. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they disagree </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>They disagree as to what the opinion of the Rabbis is. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who deems </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>holds that his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. And the one who deems </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I</span> maintain <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">I say is </span>correct <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis; the Rabbis deem one who renounces ownership over his hazardous property exempt only </span>in the situation <span class="gemarra-regular">here, because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. But </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a general </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property, they deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">It may be concluded that Rabbi Elazar is the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable, as Rabbi Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">two entities </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">are not in a person’s </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">possession and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse rendered them as though they were in his possession </span>with regard to certain halakhic responsibilities. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are: A pit </span>that he dug <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and leavened bread </span>remaining in his possession on the eve of Passover <span class="gemarra-regular">from six hours, </span>i.e., noon, <span class="gemarra-regular">onward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although deriving any benefit from the bread is prohibited, and it is therefore no longer in its owner’s legal possession, nevertheless he is commanded to destroy it. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It may be concluded </span>that Rabbi Elazar is the one who says that he is liable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Elazar </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say the opposite? As we learned </span>in a mishna (30a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who turns over dung in the public domain and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. And Rabbi Elazar says: They taught </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who turned over the dung <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to acquire it,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not intend to acquire it </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Apparently, </span>according to Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is exempt, </span>since he is liable only if he intends to take possession of the dung, even if he moved it significantly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: </span>Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he returned </span>the dung <span class="gemarra-regular">to its </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>Therefore, he is exempt unless he intended to acquire it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>This can be explained by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a parable: To what is </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava comparable?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> To one who finds an uncovered pit </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">and covers it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">uncovers it again</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he left the pit as he found it, he is exempt from paying damages, and the liability lies with the one who dug the pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: Is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, </span>in the case of the pit, the result of <span class="gemarra-regular">the initial act </span>of digging the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">was not removed, </span>since even when he covered the pit, the pit itself still existed. But <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the result of <span class="gemarra-regular">the initial act was removed, </span>since once the dung was moved from its prior place, there was no longer any hazardous object there. Therefore, by returning it to its place, the hazard is created anew.
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is comparable only to one who finds an uncovered pit and fills it </span>with dirt <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">digs it up again, as </span>in this case the result of <span class="gemarra-regular">the initial act is removed, and </span>the new pit therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">exists in his possession </span>and he is liable. Likewise, one who moves dung in the public domain and then restores it to its prior place is deemed liable whether or not he intends to acquire it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said </span>that Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he turned it over at </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, which is not considered removal of the dung from its place.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what forced Rabbi Elazar to interpret </span>the mishna as referring specifically to the unique case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he turned over </span>the dung <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">is that he intended to acquire it, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not intend to acquire it </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him interpret </span>the mishna as referring to a case where he turned over the dung at a height <span class="gemarra-regular">above three </span>handbreadths, in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he did not intend to acquire it, he is liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>What forced him was that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna was difficult for him. Why </span>does it state <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he turned over </span>the dung? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he lifted </span>the dung. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn from </span>the fact that the mishna does not use the term: Lifted, which generally is referring to the act of lifting an object three handbreadths for the purpose of acquisition, that <span class="gemarra-regular">whenever </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">turned over </span>is used, it is referring to an act in which the object is lifted to a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">under three </span>handbreadths from the ground.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Elazar </span>was evidently the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous object in the public domain is still <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for any damage it causes, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>is clearly the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that if one renounces ownership of his object he is exempt from liability for any damage it causes? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (30a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who conceals a thorn or </span>a piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">glass, or who puts up a fence of thorns, or </span>who puts up <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence that </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into the public domain, and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to </span>any of <span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>this person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to one who puts up a fence of thorns, <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">projects </span>the thorns out into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in </span>a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">restricts </span>them to his own property, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara infers: In a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">restricts </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? Is it not because it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> By inference, the liability </span>in the category <span class="gemarra-regular">of Pit, </span>according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">is in the public domain, </span>where a pit generally does not belong to the one who dug it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that in principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is exempt. </span>Nevertheless, one who puts up a fence of thorns is liable, because he does not renounce ownership of the thorns that protrude into the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he restricts </span>the thorns to his own property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>The reason is not that he is not liable to pay for the damage of a pit in his own property, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">because it was stated about </span>this case that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: </span>He is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of people to rub against walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but to keep a small distance from them. Therefore, if a pedestrian is injured by the thorns, it is considered an unusual accident, for which the owner of the fence is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that in general, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned </span>in an unattributed mishna (50b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs a pit in the public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span> This mishna is referring to one who digs a pit in the public domain, where it is not owned by the one who dug it, yet the mishna deems him liable.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>is it evident that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</span>

Daf 30a

<span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Yishmael </span>that one is liable to pay for damage caused by a pit that he dug in the public domain, even if it is not his personal property?
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>ruling, that he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">is his own </span>opinion, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling, that he is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of his teacher </span>Rabbi Yishmael, and he disagrees with it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who pours water in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in-curred damage due to it, </span>the one who poured water <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who conceals a thorn or a piece of glass </span>in his wall adjacent to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">or one who puts up a fence of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thorns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one who puts up <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence that </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into the public domain, and others incurred damage due to </span>any of <span class="gemarra-regular">these, he is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for their damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of one who pours water in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only when the clothes </span>of one who slipped <span class="gemarra-regular">were soiled by the </span>dirty <span class="gemarra-regular">water, but </span>if the one who slipped <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>was injured, the one who poured the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt, </span>as it is the impact with <span class="gemarra-regular">the ground </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">injured him, </span>not the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said to Rav: </span>Why should he be exempt from paying restitution for the injury? Even if the water that he poured is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">only like his filt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that he tossed in the public domain, he should be liable. Since the muddy ground caused the injury, and the mud belongs to him, as it results from the addition of his water to the dirt, he should be liable.
Rav responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the water was not absorbed </span>into the ground? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the water was absorbed, </span>leaving only moist dirt. Since there is no mud there that can be deemed as belonging to the one who spilled the water, he is exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the mishna’s ruling refers only to the soiling of the pedestrian’s clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? According to Rav, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was already addressed in the previous mishna, with regard to a jug that broke, causing a pedestrian to fall and his clothes to become soiled.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> was stated with regard to a case where this occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the summer, </span>the dry season, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one</span> with regard to a case where it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all those</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>engage in activities that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>are permitted, i.e., those who <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">potkin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their gutters </span>and drain the sewage from their houses into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>those who <span class="gemarra-regular">flush out </span>the water from <span class="gemarra-regular">their caves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where foul-smelling water was stored, into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">during the summer they do not have permission </span>to do so, while <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rainy season they have permission </span>to do so, since the street is rained upon in any event and thereby washed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although </span>all these people perform their actions <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, if they cause damage they are liable to pay </span>for it. Because of the difference between the summer and the rainy season with regard to whether it is permitted for one to pour water into the public domain, both <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> are necessary, one for each season. This is in order to teach that even in the rainy season, when it is permitted to pour water into the public domain, one is nevertheless liable to pay for damage resulting from the water.
§ It is stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who conceals a thorn </span>or a piece of glass, or one who puts up a fence of thorns, is liable to pay for damage resulting from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">projects </span>these obstacles into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">restricts </span>them to his own property, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of people to rub against walls, </span>but to keep a certain distance from them. Therefore, if a pedestrian is wounded by the thorns, it is considered an unusual accident, for which the owner of the fence is not liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:6): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who conceals his thorns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or his pieces of glass in another’s wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the owner of the wall came and demolished his wall and it fell into the public domain, </span>and the thorns or glass <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, the one who concealed them is liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unstable wall, </span>since the one who concealed his items should have anticipated that the owner of the wall would soon demolish it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a stable wall, the one who concealed</span> his items <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt, and the owner of the wall is liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: That is to say </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who covers his pit with another’s bucket</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the owner of the bucket came and took his bucket, </span>and the pit causes damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the pit is liable.</span>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>This is exactly the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to one who conceals thorns in an unstable wall, i.e., that the hazardous item was likely to be revealed from the moment that it was concealed, and therefore its owner is liable to pay for any damage that it causes. What is the novel element in Ravina’s statement?
The Gemara answers: It is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the thorns, that the owner of the wall is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he did not know </span>who concealed the hazardous item in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to inform him </span>that he should remove them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, since </span>the owner of the bucket <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>who dug the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have informed him </span>that he was taking his bucket and is consequently liable to pay for damage caused by the pit, Ravina therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that he is not required to inform the owner of the pit, and he bears no responsibility for any damage caused.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: The early pious people would conceal their thorn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and their pieces of glass in their fields, and would dig to the depth of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>in order to bury them, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they would not obstruct the plow.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet would toss </span>his thorns <span class="gemarra-regular">into fire, </span>so they would not cause damage to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava would toss them into the Tigris [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Diglat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> River.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: One who wants to be piou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should observe the matters of </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Nezikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so as to avoid causing damage to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>he should observe <span class="gemarra-regular">the matters of </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Avot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And some say </span>he should observe <span class="gemarra-regular">the matters of </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Berakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes out his straw [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and his hay [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain to </span>use afterward as <span class="gemarra-regular">fertilizer and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to them, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage, and whoever </span>takes possession of the hay and straw <span class="gemarra-regular">first acquires </span>them for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who places obstacles in the public domain and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they cause damage, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them.
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who turns over dung in the public domain and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to it,</span> the former <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the ruling in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>that one is liable to pay for damage caused by straw or hay that he put in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: During the period when fertilizer is taken out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person may take his fertilizer out to the public domain and let it accumulate </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">for a full thirty days, so that it gets trampled by people’s feet and by animals’ feet, as </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on this condition</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua bequeathed Eretz </span>Yisrael to the Jewish people (see 80b). In other words, people do not have the right to prevent someone from taking out his straw to the public domain, since they received their portion of Eretz Yisrael following Joshua’s conquest on this condition. Apparently, since one has the right to take out his straw, he is not held liable to pay for damage caused by it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>possibly <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes that if </span>the fertilizer <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>he is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay for the damage it caused, </span>although he acted within his rights.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says:</span> If a pile of straw on the back of an animal that was passing through the public domain catches fire <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Hanukkah lamp </span>that was placed outside a store, the owner of the lamp is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, since he </span>put it there <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission </span>(see 62b)? <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not because </span>he put it there with the <span class="gemarra-regular">permission of the court </span>and is therefore exempt from paying for damage caused by it?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he put it there with the <span class="gemarra-regular">permission </span>granted to those performing <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva. </span>Permission of the court is not sufficient to exempt him from paying damages, unless, in addition, permission was granted for the purpose of performing a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that if it caught fire <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Hanukkah lamp </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt because </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">permission </span>to put it there in order to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> an alternative proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>cases in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>for people <span class="gemarra-regular">to place obstacles in the public domain,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if they caused damage, </span>these people <span class="gemarra-regular">are liable to pay, and Rabbi Yehuda exempts </span>them. Evidently, according to Rabbi Yehuda, if one has the permission of the court to put an item in the public domain, he is exempt from paying damages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: The mishna</span> is referring to a case where one put his fertilizer outside <span class="gemarra-regular">not during the period when fertilizer is taken out. </span>Therefore, he did not have permission to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that one is liable only if he acts without permission.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>an alternative explanation of the mishna according to Rabbi Yehuda: 

Daf 30b

What <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna was specifically with regard to a case where one put out <span class="gemarra-regular">his straw and his hay, </span>which are more likely to cause injury than fertilizer and other objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">slippery. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that in this case he is liable to pay for damage they cause.
§ It is stated in the mishna that if one puts his straw and hay out in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them. The Sages disagreed with regard to the extent of this acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>He acquires them <span class="gemarra-regular">both with regard to </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves and with regard to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t,</span> which took place while they were in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ze’eiri says: </span>He acquires them <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancement but not with regard to </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves, </span>and he must pay the owner of the straw according to their value at the time he placed them in the public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? Rav holds </span>that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">penalized </span>the owner by revoking his ownership of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves due to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancement </span>that he stands to earn by putting them in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Ze’eiri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not penalize </span>him by revoking his ownership of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves due to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancement. </span>Rather, he loses only the increase in their value due to their enhancement.
The Gemara attempts to prove that Ze’eiri’s opinion is correct from a case where there is no enhancement at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the continuation of the mishna that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who turns over dun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the public domain and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to it, </span>the former is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. But it does not teach </span>in this clause that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever </span>takes possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">first acquires </span>it. Apparently the Sages did not revoke his ownership of the dung, as it has no enhanced value. This does not seem to accord with Rav’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that whoever takes possession of it acquires it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught in the first clause, </span>with regard to one who puts out straw, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true in the last clause,</span> with regard to one who turns over dung. It is unnecessary to repeat it. Therefore, no support for the opinion of Ze’eiri can be derived from here.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in that regard, </span>i.e., a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses the same cases as the mishna, that the hay and straw <span class="gemarra-regular">are forbidden due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, </span>which apparently means that one may not take possession of the dung, contrary to Rav’s opinion?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are forbidden due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, it applies to the entire mishna, </span>not just to this particular clause, and it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>taking the items from <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who came first and acquired </span>them. In other words, once someone takes possession of them, it is forbidden for anyone else to take them from him, as that is considered robbery.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is not taught in this manner </span>elsewhere, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes out his straw and his hay to the public domain to </span>use afterward as <span class="gemarra-regular">fertilizer and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">incurred damage due to them, he is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and is permitted </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery. And </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who turns over dung in the public domain and another incurred damage due to it, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, but it is forbidden </span>to take possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>Is it from the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dung </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you raise a contradiction </span>to Rav’s opinion that one may take possession of straw and hay in the public domain? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that has </span>added value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>over time as a result of lying in the public domain, Rav holds that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">penalized </span>one who leaves it in the public domain, revoking his ownership of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">itself because of its </span>added value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement, </span>but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that does not have </span>added value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>by lying in the public domain, such as dung, perhaps Rav concedes that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not penalize </span>him in this manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the statement of </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says that they penalized </span>him by revoking his ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">the items themselves because of its </span>added value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement, do we impose </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">penalty immediately </span>when he takes the straw out, allowing one to take possession of it even before it has time for its value to become enhanced, <span class="gemarra-regular">or do we impose the penalty </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when its enhancement </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that the penalty is imposed immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we spoke of </span>a difficulty to Rav’s opinion from the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dung, </span>whose value does not become enhanced, indicating that according to Rav the penalty is imposed before there is any enhancement.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>this proof? <span class="gemarra-regular">When we spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">dung, </span>this was <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Naḥman </span>bar Yitzḥak <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved </span>the difficulty, explaining that perhaps Rav concedes that there is no penalty in this case. But <span class="gemarra-regular">after Rav Naḥman resolved </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it at all possible to raise an objection </span>to Rav’s opinion from the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dung? </span>Therefore, no proof can be brought from there.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is stated in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a document in which </span>a loan with <span class="gemarra-regular">interest is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we penalize </span>the lender, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">collects neither the principal nor the interest; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He collects the principal but not the interest. Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir,</span> whose penalty applies to the value of the loan itself due to its enhancement, i.e., the interest, which is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who impose the penalty only on the interest?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis. The Rabbis were saying there </span>that the principal is not forfeited by the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">only because the principal </span>was loaned <span class="gemarra-regular">in a permissible </span>manner, as the prohibition applies only to the interest. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of one who put his straw in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal, </span>i.e., the hazardous object <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, causes damage. </span>Therefore, the penalty should relate to the object itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>The reason <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir was saying there, </span>in the case of a loan with interest, that the principal is also forfeited is <span class="gemarra-regular">only that </span>the prohibition was already violated <span class="gemarra-regular">from the time of the writing</span> of the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">by making an appraisal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shuma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of how much money is to be repaid, which included interest. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of straw that one placed in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">who can say that it will cause damage? </span>Since the damage was not inevitable at the time that the straw was placed there, there is no justification for revoking the ownership of the straw itself.
The Gemara suggests alternatively: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute between Rav and Ze’eiri is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is stated in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes his straw and his hay out to the public domain to </span>use afterward as <span class="gemarra-regular">fertilizer, and another incurred damage due to them, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for his damage. And whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they are forbidden due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who places obstacles in the public domain and they cause damage, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay. And whoever </span>takes possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">them first acquires </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are permitted </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter itself is difficult. </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then it says that they are forbidden due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, </span>indicating that one may not take possession of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is this not what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>This statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancement. </span>And this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are forbidden due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves? And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel came to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves, whoever </span>takes possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of them first acquires </span>them. Therefore, this tannaitic dispute apparently relates to whether the penalty applies to the items themselves or just to the value of their enhancement.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Ze’eiri, it is certainly </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explicitly deems it permitted for one to take possession of the items. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav, shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>According <span class="gemarra-regular">to all </span>opinions, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">imposed a penalty </span>revoking his ownership of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves due to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">their enhancement. And here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>whether or not it is ruled that this is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>a public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is not issued to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that effect, as it was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed as to whether the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> revoking his ownership of the items themselves should be taught to the public. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>a public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not issued to that effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, although it is permitted for one to take possession of the straw, halakhic authorities should not publicly rule that people may do so, lest people become accustomed to taking items that belong to others. This is the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava says: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>a public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is issued to that effect. </span>This, Rav could have said, is the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rav Huna declare dried barley [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥushelei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that people laid out in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless? </span>Similarly, didn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava declare ownerless</span>

Daf 31a

<span class="gemarra-regular">residue from dates?</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Rav Adda bar Ahava </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his halakhic </span>opinion that although this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, a public ruling is not issued to that effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted </span>his prior opinion?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>owners of the barley <span class="gemarra-regular">were forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to remove the barley from the public domain, and they did not comply. Therefore, they were penalized by Rav Huna declaring publicly that their barley was ownerless.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">potter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> carrying pots <span class="gemarra-regular">who were walking one after the other </span>in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the first stumbled </span>on a bump <span class="gemarra-regular">and fell, and the second stumbled over the first </span>and fell too, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage incurred by the second.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Do not say that the mishna is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis, who say </span>that one who stumbles <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstances beyond his control and is </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, here, </span>in the case in the mishna, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, since </span>after falling <span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not stand </span>up.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to warn </span>the person behind him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not warn </span>him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to war</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> the other person either, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> busy </span>trying to stand up. Therefore, the mishna, which holds him liable, must be referring to a case where he could have stood up.
The Gemara attempts to prove that the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak is correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the next mishna (31b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam was </span>walking in the public domain carrying his beam <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the owner of a barrel was</span> walking with his barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">last, </span>i.e., behind him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel was broken by the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>the one who carried the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But if the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam stopped, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since the accident was caused by his stopping.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one carrying the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">stopped </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to adjust </span>the load <span class="gemarra-regular">on his shoulder, which is the normative behavior </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>one carrying a beam, and is not considered negligence? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nevertheless the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as, although <span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to warn</span> the person behind him that he was about to stop, he did not warn him. This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he stopped to rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which could not have been anticipated by the person walking behind him. Consequently, he is liable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this interpretation, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stop-ped to adjust </span>the load <span class="gemarra-regular">on his shoulder, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than teaching </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish and teach within </span>the former case <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that he is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stopped to rest. But </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stopped to adjust </span>the load <span class="gemarra-regular">on his shoulder, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara answers: The mishna is presented in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner because it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this </span>novelty, <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if he stopped to rest, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when he says to the owner of the barrel: Stop, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an alternative proof from what is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">potters and glazier</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who were walking one after the other, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the first stumbled</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fell, and the second stumbled over the first, </span>sustaining damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the third </span>stumbled <span class="gemarra-regular">over the second, </span>also falling and sustaining damage, in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of the second, and the second </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of the third. But if they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">fell because of the first, the first </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of them all. And if they warned each other, </span>i.e., each one warned the next, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, and they are nevertheless liable to pay for not warning the people behind them, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up and they did not do so.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this interpretation, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would they be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? If so, rather than teaching </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they warned one another, they are exempt, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish and teach within </span>the former case <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that they are liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not have </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are exempt.</span>
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is presented in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner because it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this </span>novelty, <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if they had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when they warned each other they are exempt.</span>
§ With regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The first </span>one who stumbled is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of the second, both for damage caused </span>to the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">by his body and for damage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">by his property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of the third </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage caused by his body </span>as result of the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not with regard to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caused by his property.</span>
The Gemara questions Rava’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you </span>look at it, this is difficult to understand. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Rava maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be liable </span>to pay for all forms of damage caused by his negligence. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>Rava maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, even the first should be exempt</span> from liability for the damage incurred by the second. 

Daf 31b

The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first is certainly</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and is therefore liable to pay for damage caused by both his body and his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">The second is deemed liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his body, as he had </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to stand </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not stand </span>up. <span class="gemarra-regular">For </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his property </span>that was lying there and that caused the third person to stumble and fall, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as he can say to him: I did not dig this pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I did not cause this obstacle. Since it was the first person who stumbled and brought about the situation where the items of the second were lying on the ground, the second is not deemed liable.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rava’s statement from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that comments on this case: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of them are liable</span> to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage caused by their bodies and exempt </span>from paying restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage caused by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their property. What, does this not </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, </span>indicating that even he is exempt from damage caused by his property?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to all of them <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the first. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them, </span>indicating that the first is also included? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them </span>refers only to <span class="gemarra-regular">those who incurred damage,</span> and excludes the first one, who only caused damage to others.
The Gemara questions this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>interpretation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the term includes <span class="gemarra-regular">even the first, this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught: All of them. But if you say </span>that it is referring to all of them <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the first, what is </span>the reason that the misleading term: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of them </span>is used? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>more accurately that <span class="gemarra-regular">those who incurred damage </span>are liable in turn for the damage caused by their bodies, but are exempt from paying restitution for damage caused by their property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this entire explanation of Rava’s statement should be rejected, and it should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable both for injury </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the body of the second and for damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the property of the second, and the second </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incurred by the third with regard to injury to his body but not with regard to damage to his property. What is the reason </span>for the exemption in the last case? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>after his fall, the body of the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, and we do not find that </span>in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shmuel, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any obstacle </span>that was placed in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">constitutes a pit, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a pit apply to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the one who placed it there <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces ownership </span>of the hazardous object it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>renounce ownership of it then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>The second one who fell obviously did not renounce ownership of his body, so why is he exempt from damage he caused to vessels as though he were a pit?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually,</span> Rava’s statement should be explained <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he was understood to have <span class="gemarra-regular">said initially, </span>i.e., that he distinguishes between damage caused by another’s body and damage caused by his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And as for your difficulty </span>from the statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them are liable </span>to pay for the damage caused by their bodies but exempt from paying restitution for the damage caused by their property, apparently including even the first one, contrary to Rava’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Minyumi interpreted it before Ravina </span>as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where vessels were damaged by vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, it is not the body, but the vessels of the second that were damaged by the property of the first, and since the broken vessels of the first have the status of a pit, the owner is exempt from liability for damage caused to the vessels of others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">fell because of the first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for the damage of them all. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">fall because of the first? Rav Pappa said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he blocked the road like a skeleton [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keshilda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> filling the entire width of the road and causing the rest to stumble over different parts of his body. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>He fell diagonally <span class="gemarra-regular">like a blind man’s cane</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they all stumbled over him.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barrel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from the opposite direction <span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this one’s jug was broken by that one’s </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>the one carrying the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, because this one had permission to walk </span>in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">had permission to walk </span>there.
If they were walking in the same direction, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam was </span>walking <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in front, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of a barrel last, </span>behind him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel was broken by the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since the owner of the barrel saw him in front of him and should have been more careful. 

Daf 32a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But if the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam stopped</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> causing the barrel to collide with the beam and break, the former is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since the latter had no way of anticipating that he would stop. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for breaking the barrel.
Conversely, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the barrel was </span>walking <span class="gemarra-regular">firs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam last, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel was broken by the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if owner of the barrel stopped, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for breaking the barrel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam: Stop, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And similarly, </span>these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> apply in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one came with his lamp and that one came with his flax, </span>and the lamp set fire to the flax.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Natan asked Rav Huna: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who causes injury to his wife during sexual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is he liable to pay damages? Is it reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is acting in a permitted manner </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, or perhaps he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should pay attention </span>and be more careful?
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabba bar Natan: <span class="gemarra-regular">You learned this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna concerning one person walking with a cross beam and another with a barrel, which rules that the owner of the cross beam is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because this one had permission to walk and that one </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">had permission to walk. </span>Similarly, since the husband has permission to engage in intercourse with his wife, if he injures her in the process he is exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>disagreed with Rav Huna’s opinion and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The husband is liable due to an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to manslaughter, as it is stated in the Torah: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood…and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">forest, where this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">entered his domain and that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">entered his domain, </span>as it is the domain of the public, and nevertheless the one who kills unintentionally is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered like one who entered another’s domain and </span>is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to be exiled to a city of refuge, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">enters another’s domain, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that he should be liable for the injury he causes her?
The Gemara raises an objection to Rava’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> what of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches </span>that the owner of the cross beam is exempt, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this one had permission to walk and that one had permission to walk, </span>and Rav Huna inferred from here that the husband is likewise exempt.
The Gemara answers: The two cases are different. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sides <span class="gemarra-regular">were similarly </span>walking, and the one who caused the damage is therefore exempt due to his right to walk there. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the husband is the only active participant in the intercourse. Therefore, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">performing an action, </span>he is liable even though he is acting with permission.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is she not </span>considered an active participant? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written </span>with regard to forbidden sexual intercourse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” </span>(Leviticus 18:29), indicating that both the man and woman are considered to be performing an action?
The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">they both have pleasure</span> from the act. The woman’s pleasure is tantamount to active transgression, and she is therefore punished if she participates willfully. But with regard to a wife’s injury, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>the one who is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">performing an action,</span> and he is therefore liable.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam was </span>walking <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>and the owner of the barrel was walking behind him, if the barrel was broken by the cross beam, the owner of the cross beam is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">two cows </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">prone and one walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the cow that was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking kicked the </span>cow that was <span class="gemarra-regular">prone, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">prone </span>cow <span class="gemarra-regular">kicked </span>the cow that was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>this statement, as it states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam was first and the owner of the barrel was last, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel was broken by the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, he is exempt. But if the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam stopped, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">prone </span>cow kicked the cow that was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking, </span>since the one carrying the barrel was walking and the one carrying the cross beam stopped in the public domain, causing damage to the former. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in this case that the owner of the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that reasoning? <span class="gemarra-regular">You wanted to support </span>the statement of Reish Lakish from the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Not only does it not support </span>Reish Lakish; <span class="gemarra-regular">it even raises a difficulty </span>to his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>Reish Lakish stated that the owner of the prone cow is liable is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it kicked</span> the walking cow; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the walking cow <span class="gemarra-regular">was damaged </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself </span>it collided with the prone cow, he would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But the mishna </span>discusses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one carrying the barrel ran into the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">by himself, </span>without the one carrying the cross beam actively hitting it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it teaches </span>that the owner of the cross beam is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">blocked the </span>entire width of the <span class="gemarra-regular">road like a carcass. </span>Since the one carrying the barrel could not avoid it, the one carrying the cross beam is liable although he did not actively break the barrel. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>Reish Lakish’s statement is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">was lying down on one side </span>of the public domain, and the other cow <span class="gemarra-regular">should have walked on the other, </span>unobstructed <span class="gemarra-regular">side. </span>Therefore, if the damage is caused only as a result of their collision, the owner of the prone cow is exempt.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause of the mishna </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">supports Reish Lakish’s </span>statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: </span>Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the owner of the barrel was </span>walking <span class="gemarra-regular">first and the owner of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam last, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel was broken by the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if the owner of the barrel stopped, </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for breaking the barrel. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the walking</span> cow kicked <span class="gemarra-regular">the prone </span>cow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the owner of the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>lending support to Reish Lakish’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>exempts the one carrying the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">because he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was walking in his normal manner </span>when he hit the barrel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>perhaps the owner of the prone cow <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the walking cow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although you have permission to walk over me, </span>i.e., for your cow to walk over my cow, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have no permission to kick me, </span>i.e., for your cow to kick my cow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who were walking in the public domain, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">running and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or who were both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">running</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and they damaged one another, both of them are exempt.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Yehuda. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Yehuda says </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">runs </span>in the public domain and causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay for any damage he causes <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>his behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">is unusual </span>in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Isi concedes </span>with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <span class="gemarra-regular">twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Yehuda. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that if one runs and causes damage he is liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say, </span>as a principle, that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with an unattributed mishna? And we learned </span>in this mishna that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one was running and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one was walking, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they were both running, they are exempt.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna, </span>which exempts one who was running, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twilight on the eve of Shabbat, </span>when people are permitted to run in the public domain.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it inferred that the mishna is referring to twilight on the eve of Shabbat? It is inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches: Or who were both running, they are exempt. Why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do I need this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well? Now </span>that the mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one was running and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one was walking, </span>the one running is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that he is exempt when <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them were running? Rather,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was running and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one was walking, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to twilight on the eve of Shabbat, </span>when running in the public domain is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">But on a weekday, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one was running and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one was walking, </span>the one who was running is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">both were running, even on a weekday, they are exempt. </span>This emendation explains the need to mention the case where both were running.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Isi concedes </span>with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <span class="gemarra-regular">twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the reason that running at twilight <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of Shabbat </span>is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Ḥanina </span>would say, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥanina would say </span>at twilight on the eve of Shabbat: 

Daf 32b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Come and let us go ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to gree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bride, the queen. And some say </span>that this is what he would say: Come and let us go out <span class="gemarra-regular">to greet Shabbat, the bride, the queen. Rabbi Yannai would wrap himself </span>in his <span class="it-text">tallit</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and stand </span>at the eve of Shabbat at twilight, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: Come, bride</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come, bride. </span>Similarly, it is appropriate for one to run out in honor of Shabbat.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was chopping </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and </span>a chip flew off and <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">private property </span>of another person, or one who was chopping wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property and caused </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage in the public domain, </span>or one who was chopping wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">private property </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">another, </span>in all these cases he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to teach that he is liable in all these cases because in each one there is a novel element. <span class="gemarra-regular">As if it had taught </span>only the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was chopping </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property and caused damage in the public domain,</span> it might have been reasoned that he is liable, despite the fact that he was working in his private property, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">multitudes </span>to be there. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if a chip flew <span class="gemarra-regular">from the public domain to </span>another person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">private property, where </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not common </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">multitudes </span>to be, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach this case as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it had taught </span>that he is liable where the chip flew <span class="gemarra-regular">from the public domain to </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">private property, </span>it might have been reasoned that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because at the outset he was acting without permission by chopping wood in the public domain. But </span>if it flew <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property to the public domain, since he was acting with permission </span>by chopping wood in his private property, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">had taught </span>only that he is liable in <span class="gemarra-regular">these two</span> cases, it might have been reasoned that in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where the damage was caused in the public domain, he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">multitudes </span>to be there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where he was chopping in the public domain, he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he was acting <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission. But </span>in the last case, where the chip flew <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">another’s private property, </span>where neither of the above reasons applies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not common </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">multitudes </span>to be in the place where the damage was caused <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>was acting <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission at the outset, </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to teach all these cases.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 6:25): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who entered the workshop of a carpenter without </span>the latter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">permission, and a chip of wood flew off and hit him in the face and he died, </span>the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But if he entered </span>the shop <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission,</span> the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it rules that the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: </span>If the other person was injured, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of indemnit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that one who injures another must pay. These are: Cost of the damage, pain, medical costs, and loss of livelihood. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the one who entered was killed, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from exile.</span>
The Gemara explains that he is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is not similar to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forest, </span>which is the archetypal case stated in the Torah requiring one who kills unintentionally to be exiled, as it is written: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5). This is because in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">forest, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this one entered his domain and that one entered his domain, </span>as anyone may use the public domain, whereas in <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> case, the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">entered another’s property. </span>Therefore, the carpenter is not exiled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>On the contrary; it can be inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> that he is exiled. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">forest, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">this one entered of his own accord and that one entered of his own accord, </span>neither asking for the other’s permission, nevertheless the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered like one who entered with the other’s consent and </span>therefore the one who kills unintentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">is exiled, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">entered another’s </span>workshop <span class="gemarra-regular">with his consent, </span>the carpenter should be exiled?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: What </span>is the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt from exile? As exile is not sufficient for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this is the reason of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, </span>who exempts him from exile: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it is </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentional </span>killing that is <span class="gemarra-regular">approaching intentional </span>manslaughter. The purpose of exile is to atone for one who kills another completely unintentionally; if he was exceedingly negligent, exile is not sufficient to atone for him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>to his own explanation from a mishna: If one is sentenced to be flogged in court and the doctors assessed that he would be able to endure only a certain number of lashes, but the one administering the lashes <span class="gemarra-regular">added one lash to his </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and he died, </span>the agent of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">is exiled on account of him </span>(<span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 22b). <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unintentional </span>killing that is <span class="gemarra-regular">approaching intentional </span>manslaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it should have entered his mind that people can die by one </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">lash. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the agent of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">is exiled. Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said </span>in response: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he erred in the counting, </span>which is not considered approaching intentional manslaughter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava slapped </span>Rav Shimi <span class="gemarra-regular">on his sandal, </span>a gesture of disparagement, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Is that to say </span>that the one administering the lashes is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">counts</span> them? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the eldest of the judge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recites </span>the verses that are read to a person while he receives lashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>judge <span class="gemarra-regular">counts, and the third says </span>to the one administering the lashes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Strike him? </span>Accordingly, it is not the one administering the lashes who erred in counting.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the judge himself erre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in counting, and the one administering the lashes did not notice this error and meted out an extra lash, causing the person to die. It is therefore considered a completely unintentional killing. Consequently, he is exiled.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from another mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who throws a stone into the public domai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and kills </span>someone, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exiled.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But here, </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional </span>killing that is <span class="gemarra-regular">approaching intentional </span>manslaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it should have entered his mind that people are commonly </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exiled.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: </span>It is not a case where one threw a stone into the public domain for no purpose, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">where he demolishes his wall, </span>which borders on the public domain, and stones fall into the public domain. Therefore, it is not considered to be approaching intentional manslaughter.
The Gemara questions this assertion: Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have paid attention </span>to see if there was anyone there, and therefore it should be considered an unintentional killing that approaches intentional manslaughter. The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he demolishes </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">at night.</span>
The Gemara asks: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">at night, he should also have paid attention </span>to see if there was anyone there. The Gemara suggests an alternative interpretation: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he demolishes his wall during the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day into a garbage dump</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where people are not commonly found.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this garbage dump? If </span>it is a garbage dump <span class="gemarra-regular">where the multitudes are commonly </span>found, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">intentional </span>manslaughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the multitudes are not commonly </span>found there, he should be considered not only one who kills unintentionally, but <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</span> since he could not have anticipated that someone would be there. Therefore, he should be exempt from exile.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a garbage dump where </span>people are <span class="gemarra-regular">given to relieve themselves at nigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and are not given to relieve themselves during the day, </span>as it is near the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there are those who chance by and sit </span>there for this purpose even during the day. On the one hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not </span>one who kills <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, as </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are not given to relieve themselves </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day. </span>On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not a victim of circumstances beyond his control either, as there are those who chance by and sit there. </span>Therefore, he is considered one who kills unintentionally and is liable to be exiled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa taught in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>aforementioned statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> but is <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the first clause: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who enters the workshop of a carpente</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without permission, and a chip </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">flies off and strikes him in the face and he dies, </span>the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>In reference to this clause <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: </span>If the one who entered was merely injured, the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity. But </span>if the one who entered was killed, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from exile.</span>
The Gemara comments: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who teaches this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where one enters with permission, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>would he teach it <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the first clause, </span>where one enters without permission. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the one who teaches this</span> statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the first clause </span>teaches it only in reference to that clause. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in the </span>case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">last clause, since </span>he entered <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission </span>the carpenter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to go into <span class="gemarra-regular">exile.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is he liable </span>to go into <span class="gemarra-regular">exile </span>when the victim had permission to enter? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who enters the workshop of a welder, and sparks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nitzotzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fly off and strike him in his face and he dies, </span>the welder is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">entered with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permission?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here, </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the welder’s apprentice </span>who enters his workshop. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does the welder’s apprentice stand to be killed, </span>i.e., is it permitted to kill him? The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his mentor is urging him to leave, and he does not leave.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And because his mentor is urging him to leave, does he stand to be killed? </span>The welder should be careful until his apprentice leaves. The Gemara answers: The welder <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>when the accident happened. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>why establish that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers specifically to an apprentice? The welder would be exempt if it were any <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">also. </span>

Daf 33a

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have awe of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mentor. </span>Therefore, even if the welder urges another person to leave, he must ascertain that that person actually did so, and otherwise he is liable to be exiled. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>apprentice <span class="gemarra-regular">has awe of his mentor, </span>and so the welder may assume that if he instructed him to leave, he certainly did. Therefore, if in reality the apprentice did not leave and is killed by the sparks, the welder is not liable to be exiled, as he is not held accountable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid taught in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>aforementioned statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the above <span class="it-text">baraita</span> but is <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is stated in the verse concerning one who kills unintentionally: “And the head slips off the helve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and finds </span>his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5); this serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who introduces himself </span>into an area of danger, in which case the one who kills unintentionally is exempt from exile. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here Rabbi Eliezer Ben Ya’akov says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a stone departe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his hand, and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">stuck out his head and received </span>a blow from <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>and died, the one who threw the stone is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from exile. It is in reference to this statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He is exempt from exile </span>for killing him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the victim was merely injured, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>he would teach it <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the first </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where one entered the workshop of the carpenter. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the one who teaches it with regard to the first </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches it only in reference to that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from liability for injury, as one could claim that he is completely blameless.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to salaried <span class="gemarra-regular">laborers who came </span>into their employer’s courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to claim their wage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the homeowner, and the homeowner’s ox gored them, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the homeowner’s dog bit them, and </span>a laborer <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Others say </span>that he is liable, as salaried <span class="gemarra-regular">laborers are allowed </span>to enter their employer’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">to claim their wages from the homeowner.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>the employer <span class="gemarra-regular">can be found in the city, what is the reason of the others, </span>who hold him liable? The laborers could have met him in the city to claim their wages and did not need to enter his courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he can be found </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at home, what is the reason of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who exempts him? Clearly they are entitled to claim their wages.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>these are not the circumstances under discussion. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a man who can </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">be found </span>in town <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be found </span>in town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the laborers <span class="gemarra-regular">called </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">at the gate </span>of his courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said to them: Yes. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>referred to as the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">yes </span>in this context <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates: Come in. </span>Therefore, he is liable for their death. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">yes </span>in this context <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Stand in your plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and I will come out to you. Since he did not give them permission to enter, he is exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes </span>in this context <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates: Stand in your place.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two innocuous oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the respective damages are evaluated, and if one amount is more than the other, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half the damages with regard to the difference. </span>In other words, the owner of the ox that caused the greater damage pays the other owner half the difference. If <span class="gemarra-regular">both oxen were forewarned, </span>the owner of the ox that caused the greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference.</span>
In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the oxen was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox caused greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox than the reverse, the owner of the forewarned ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference. </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox caused greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half the damage with regard to the difference.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two people who injured each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one who did greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference, </span>since one is always considered forewarned with regard to damage he causes.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">person, </span>whichever side caused the greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference. </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">person, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the person </span>caused greater financial damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference. </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox caused greater damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to the person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half the damage with regard to the difference. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that injured a person also pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference. </span>Rabbi Akiva does not distinguish between an innocuous and a forewarned ox in a case where an ox injures a person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis about a case where an ox injures a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>It is derived from the verse: “Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to this judgment shall it be done to him” </span>(Exodus 21:31), that <span class="gemarra-regular">as is the judgment </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox</span> that causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ox, so is the judgment </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to a person. Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ox,</span> if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>he pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to a person, </span>if it is an <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and </span>if it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox the owner pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">full</span> cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>It is derived from the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“according to this judgment” </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an ox that gores a person is judged <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the case that appears in <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>verse, i.e., the case of a forewarned ox, which appears in Exodus 21:29, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not like </span>the case that appears in <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>verse, i.e., the case of an innocuous ox, which appears in Exodus 21:28.
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that since the case of an ox that gored a person is compared to the case of a forewarned ox, the owner also <span class="gemarra-regular">pays from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Shall it be done to him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">l</span><span class="gemarra-italic">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the proceeds of the sale of the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of his belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not pay from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, as the word <span class="it-text">lo</span> can also be understood as referring to the ox. In this manner the case of an innocuous ox that gores a person is compared to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an innocuous ox that gores another ox, whereas with regard to the amount of restitution, it is compared to the case of a forewarned ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who do not differentiate between an ox that gores a person and one that gores an animal, inasmuch as the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned ox applies in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the seemingly superfluous word <span class="gemarra-regular">“this”? </span>The Gemara answers: The word is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt him from the four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> types of indemnit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that one who injures another person is liable to pay, thereby emphasizing the comparison to the case of an ox that gores an ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where does Rabbi Akiva </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">exempting him from </span>paying these <span class="gemarra-regular">four types of indemnity? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if a man maims his neighbor, </span>as he has done, so shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19). Rabbi Akiva derives from here that only when <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span>injures <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor </span>is he liable to pay these four types of indemnity, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>injures <span class="gemarra-regular">his neighbor.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>not derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from that verse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it would have been derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that he is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>from paying for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs and loss of liveli-hood, </span>I would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give him </span>compensation. Therefore, the phrase “according to this judgment” <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> that he is not liable to pay compensation for anything other than the damage itself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass </span>of the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not worth anything, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">takes the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>that gored it, since it is worth half the value of the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, </span>which rules that the injured party takes the ox immediately? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: After it gores another ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>belligerent <span class="gemarra-regular">ox shall be appraised in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> before it is taken by the injured party, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: The ox was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">assigned </span>to the owner of the dead ox as payment, and if the amount of damages is not contested by the owner of the goring ox, no further legal steps are required.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? Rabbi Yishmael holds </span>that the owner of the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>of the owner of the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is money that he is claiming from him, </span>but he has no ownership of the body of the belligerent ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are partners, </span>i.e., from the time the innocuous ox killed the other ox, the owner of the dead ox has a share of ownership in the belligerent ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree with regard to </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">this verse: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value” </span>(Exodus 21:35). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is commanding the court</span> to evaluate the damages in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is commanding the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage </span>to split ownership of the live ox, without the involvement of the court.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two opinions as to whether or not they are considered partners? The Gemara answers: There <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>the ox to the Temple. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, until the court transfers the ox to the injured party, it still belongs to its owner, and therefore the injured party cannot consecrate it. According to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, the injured party owns the ox from the time the damage was inflicted, and he can therefore consecrate it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava asked Rav Naḥman: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage sold </span>the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yishmael? </span>Is it that <span class="gemarra-regular">since Rabbi Yishmael says </span>that the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor, and it is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">money that he is claiming from him, it is sold? Or perhaps</span>

Daf 33b

does he say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liened </span>to the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">to the injured </span>party, who will collect it should the ox’s owner not have sufficient funds, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not in his </span>power to sell it? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is not sold.</span>
Rava asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, it is sold? </span>Rav Naḥman replied: Nevertheless, the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">then collects it</span> from the purchaser. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">then collects it </span>from the purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is it sold? </span>His right to collect it negates the effectiveness of the sale. The Gemara answers: It is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ridya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The purchaser may use the ox for plowing until the injured party collects it from him, and the purchaser is not required to reimburse the injured party for the use of his ox.
The Gemara asks: Should one <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this ruling that with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sells </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, the court can collect </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this property <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>the creditor, as according to Rabbi Yishmael the belligerent ox is only a lien for the debt owed to the injured party? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who rendered it designated payment </span>of the debt, since the Torah specifies that the injured party collects damages from the ox. In general, however, movable property that is sold by a debtor cannot be collected by the creditor.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rava say </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered his slave </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repayment </span>for a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">sold him, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditor collects </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the purchaser, whereas if one rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repayment and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it, the creditor cannot collect </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the purchaser? This contradicts the previous statement that the belligerent ox is considered designated repayment, and therefore even if it is sold the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.
The Gemara answers: The distinction made in Rava’s statement answers this question. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave </span>who was rendered as designated repayment can be collected from the purchaser? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>rendering a slave as designated repayment is not common and generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity. </span>The purchaser was therefore aware of this when he bought the slave. Similarly, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, since it gored </span>an animal, it generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity, as </span>it is publicly <span class="gemarra-regular">called a goring ox,</span> and so the purchaser was aware of the lien attached to it. Therefore, the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Taḥalifa from the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Abbahu: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, it is not sold, </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, it is consecrated.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who sold it? </span>Is it the injured party or the liable party? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for the damage, whose </span>opinion is it that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not sold? It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">assigned </span>to the injured party. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the following statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox shall be appraised in court.</span>
If, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party selling it, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is it that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, it is not sold? </span>It is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael,</span> who holds that the injured party has no share of ownership in the ox until it is transferred to him by the court. But in the statement that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not seem to accord with either opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for the damage, and everyone agrees </span>with its ruling. The ruling that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, it is not sold </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, as </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liened to the injured </span>party, precluding the owner from selling it.
The statement that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Akiva, </span>since it is not actually consecrated but is considered so only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abbahu. As Rabbi Abbahu says </span>that if one consecrates liened property, although the consecration does not take effect, nevertheless he is required to redeem it, due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property can be <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from the ownership of the Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">without redemption. </span>Therefore, the ineffectiveness of the ox’s consecration notwithstanding, he is still required to redeem it, by means of minimal payment, so as not to cause the denigration of Temple property.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous ox that caused damage, </span>if, <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he sold it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">sold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or gave it as a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what he did is done, </span>i.e., takes effect. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he stood tria</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and is now obligated to pay the injured party, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, it is not sold; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, it is not consecrated; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it or gave it is a gift, he has done nothing.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors</span> of the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he owed </span>the creditors <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>his ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage or whether it caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage before he owed </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they have done nothing. </span>Their collection is void, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>compensation to the injured party is <span class="gemarra-regular">paid only from the body of </span>the ox, as it was innocuous, and it is therefore designated exclusively for this compensation.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial or whether he did not stand trial, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">sold; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it or gave it as a gift, what he did is done. </span>Likewise, if <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors collected </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">first, whether he owed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">before it caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it caused </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage before he owed </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">did is done. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the restitution is <span class="gemarra-regular">paid only from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, not from the body of the ox. Therefore, what he or his creditors do with the ox takes effect.
The Gemara explains the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above, with regard to an innocuous ox, that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">sold. </span>As explained above, the sale is valid only with regard to the purchaser using the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing</span> in the interim, until the injured party collects it.
The statement that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>does not mean that it is actually consecrated, but rather that it must be redeemed through payment of a minimal sum, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to Rabbi Abbahu’s </span>statement mentioned above.
With regard to the statement that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it or gave it as a present, what he did is done, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave it as a present, what he did is done </span>with regard to the recipient’s permission to use it <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it, </span>how does that affect the injured party’s rights? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him come and receive payment from </span>the slaughtered ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">meat.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is stated in the Torah: “Then they shall sell the <span class="gemarra-regular">live </span>ox” (Exodus 21:35). <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that the injured party receives a share of ownership if the belligerent ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive. From where</span> do I derive that this applies even if the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it? The verse states: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“Then they shall sell </span>the live <span class="gemarra-regular">ox,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>whatever the circumstances, the injured party is paid from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizevi said: </span>This statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the diminished </span>value of the ox due to its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>Although the value of the ox may no longer cover the damage, its owner is not liable to compensate the injured party beyond the ox’s current value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who causes damage to another’s liened property is exempt </span>from paying compensation, since the property does not actually belong to the one who holds the lien.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this inference from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case where one slaughters a liened ox, that he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he can say to him: I have not detracted anything from </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, as he can say to him: I took only spirit from </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>He detracted only the life of the ox, not its physical body, and one who causes damage to another’s liened property might be exempt from liability for this intangible damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But generally </span>one who causes damage to another’s lien <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable. </span>Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that one is exempt from liability for all types of damage he causes to another’s liened property.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba stated this </span>principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>and there would be no need for Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, to state it. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabba says: One who burns another’s documents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which other people’s debts to him are recorded, <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt,</span> although the owner of the documents can no longer collect payment from liened property.
The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this principle <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>that he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the perpetrator of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the documents: <span class="gemarra-regular">I burned your mere paper, </span>for which I am prepared to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one dug pits, ditches, or caves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>liened land, causing substantial damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should be liable </span>to compensate the one holding the lien. Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that even in a case of substantial damage he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where the ox was slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like one who dug pits, ditches, or caves, </span>as slaughter is considered substantial damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">what he did is done.</span>
The Gemara continues to explain the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors collected </span>the innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">first, whether </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">owed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>his ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage or whether it caused damage before he owed </span>them, they <span class="gemarra-regular">have done nothing, because </span>restitution is <span class="gemarra-regular">paid only from the body of </span>the ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it caused damage before he owed </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured parties came first, </span>and the ox is liened to the debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he owed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">before it caused damage, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creditor </span>collected it <span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>so why does he not have the preemptive right to the ox? 

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, even </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage before he owed </span>them, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">the creditor </span>came <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>and seized what he rightfully deserved. Should one <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if <span class="gemarra-regular">a later credito</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collected </span>a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>an earlier creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">his collection is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not valid </span>and payment should instead be given to the earlier creditor?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually, I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the collection of </span>the later creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid, and there, </span>in the case where a creditor seized the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different, as </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the creditor who seized the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was in your possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would I not have collected it from you? </span>The reason I would take it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that I am paid from this ox that caused me damage. </span>Therefore, the creditor cannot collect the ox, even if the debt preceded the damage.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> injured it, </span>reducing its value <span class="gemarra-regular">by fifty dinars [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the injured ox subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">appreciated </span>in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at four hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while if </span>the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">had not injured it, its </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">would have </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at eight hundred dinars, </span>in this case the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him </span>only twenty-five dinars, which is half the value of the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time the injury </span>occurred.
If the injured ox <span class="gemarra-regular">depreciated </span>in value and its worth is now less than at the time it was injured, the damage is evaluated <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the ox’s worth at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial. </span>In other words, the owner of the belligerent ox must pay the difference between its value before it was injured and its current value.
If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that caused the injury, </span>from which the owner of the injured ox collects damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">appreciate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in value, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the injured party a share of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the injury. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">it depreciated</span> in value, the owner gives him a share <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the first clause of the second half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that caused the damage appreciated </span>in value, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the injured party a share <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the ox’s value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the injury. </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>apparently in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor, and it is money that he is claiming from him, </span>as he has no share of ownership in the belligerent ox.
The Gemara states a difficulty with this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the second half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">depreciated </span>in value, the owner gives the injured party a share <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial. </span>Here <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that the owners of the two oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">are partners, </span>i.e., the injured party has a share of ownership in the belligerent ox. How can it be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael’s </span>opinion, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is all </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>that they are partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>in the case where the belligerent ox appreciated in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the reason it appreciated is that its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Though the injured party has a share of ownership in the ox, he has no share in the appreciation in value, and his share is therefore calculated according to its value at the time of the injury.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened it, say the first clause </span>of the first half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, stated with regard to the injured ox: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it appreciated </span>in value, and its value <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at four hundred dinars, </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the injury. If </span>this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened it, need it be said </span>that the owner of the belligerent ox is not exempt from compensation?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: You find </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the first half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to be true <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he fattened it or whether it appreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself. And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">found it necessary </span>to mention this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us that </span>even in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">appreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its value <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the injury </span>and not at the time of the trial. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the second half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, with regard to a case where the belligerent ox appreciated in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened it.</span>
It is stated in the latter clause of the first half of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the injured ox <span class="gemarra-regular">depreciated </span>in value, it is evaluated <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>its worth at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to what did it depreciate </span>in value? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">depreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">due to labor </span>for which it was used, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the liable party <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You reduced </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">value and I should </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>you extra compensation?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it depreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span>continuous effect of the <span class="gemarra-regular">wound, as </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: The horn of your ox is buried in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is still losing value due to the wound.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth nothing, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>type of case that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value” </span>(Exodus 21:35).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And that is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>yet your interpretation of the verse is incorrect. <span class="gemarra-regular">You have upheld </span>the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then they shall sell the live ox and divide its monetary value,” </span>which fits your interpretation of the case. But <span class="gemarra-regular">you have not upheld </span>the latter clause of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the dead they shall also divide,” </span>since in the case you mentioned the carcass is worthless. Rather, to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case is the verse referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worth fifty dinars. </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the living </span>ox, one hundred dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the </span>value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dead</span> ox, twenty-five dinars; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>party also <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the living </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dead </span>ox.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored an ox worth two hundred</span> dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worth fifty dinars, this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the living </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dead </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>party also <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the living </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dead </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is the </span>case of the belligerent <span class="gemarra-regular">ox stated in the Torah. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: This is not </span>the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ox stated in the Torah. Rather, </span>it is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worth nothing. </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>case that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value.” Rather, how do I realize </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the dead they shall also divide”?</span> This clause means that the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>value of the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that was diminished by </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>is compensated for by <span class="gemarra-regular">dividing </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the live </span>ox between the two parties, while its owner does not receive a share in the carcass of the dead ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda </span>hold that in the case described by Rabbi Yehuda, where the carcass is worth fifty, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred and twenty-five, and that </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred and twenty-five. </span>Rabbi Meir holds that the injured party keeps the carcass, worth fifty, and receives another seventy-five dinars, half the value of the damage, from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox. Its owner is thereby left with one hundred and twenty-five dinars out of the two hundred that it is worth. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the value of both oxen is split between the two parties, leaving each with one hundred and twenty-five. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>? Why does it matter in which manner the compensation is calculated?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the carcass depreciates in value between the ox’s death and the time it is sold, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass </span>is sustained <span class="gemarra-regular">by the injured </span>party. The one liable for the damage is not responsible for any depreciation in value that occurs after the loss caused by the attack has been evaluated. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">half of the diminishing </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the carcass </span>is sustained <span class="gemarra-regular">by the one liable for damage, </span>since he receives half of the dead ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, we have found, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>

Daf 34b

a case where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox that causes damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is more stringent than </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, since according to all opinions, in a case where a forewarned ox kills another ox, the carcass belongs exclusively to the injured party, and he sustains any subsequent decrease in its value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, </span>Rabbi Yehuda holds that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent than with regard to a forewarned ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If a bailee did not safeguard an ox properly, and it escaped and caused damage, if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox he <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, and </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox he <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>(45b), that mishna cannot serve as proof for the issue under discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you heard Rabbi Yehuda </span>express this opinion, that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding, as verses are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah from which this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived. But <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to compensation, did you </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">hear him </span>express this opinion?
On the contrary; <span class="gemarra-regular">but isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth one hundred dinars that gored an ox worth five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., four dinars, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half the living </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the dead </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half the living </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the dead </span>ox. Accordingly, the injured party receives fifty-two dinars in value, which is much more than his ox was worth before it was killed.
Instead, continues Rabbi Yehuda, you should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: For what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">singled out </span>by the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">to render it </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent </span>than the case of an innocuous ox, or <span class="gemarra-regular">to render it </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient? </span>Clearly, <span class="gemarra-regular">you must say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to render it </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent. </span>And therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">what he damaged </span>and no more, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that the owner is not liable to pay more than the value of the damage? Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda does not allow for liability in the case of an innocuous ox to be more stringent than in the case of a forewarned ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rava’s explanation, that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree with regard to a case where the carcass depreciated in value, should be rejected. Instead, their dispute should be explained according to what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said, </span>i.e., that the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the appreciation of the carcas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in value after the ox’s death; <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the entire increased value of the carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the injured </span>party, since the owner of the belligerent ox has no share in the carcass, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the increased value belongs to the injured party and half goes to the one liable for the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>explains <span class="gemarra-regular">what was difficult for Rabbi Yehuda </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One has mercy on the one liable for damage, as he takes </span>a share <span class="gemarra-regular">of the increased value </span>of the carcass, <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>it be that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored an ox worth one hundred dinars, and the carcass is worth fifty dinars, this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half the live </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the dead </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half the live </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the dead </span>ox? Accordingly, the owner of the belligerent ox receives thirty-five dinars in value, which is more than his ox was worth.
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Where do we find </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage gains </span>from the damage, comparable to this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where this </span>owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gains, </span>receiving more than the value of his ox? Clearly there is no such case, as one who is liable for damage does not gain from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">it says: “He shall pay” </span>(Exodus 21:36), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays, and the owner does not take </span>more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.
The Gemara asks: For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason was it necessary to add the claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: </span>“He shall pay”? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter, </span>that the one liable for damage does not gain, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a loss sustained by the injured </span>party, as in this case, where the decrease in the ox’s value is fifty dinars, and if the carcass is shared by the liable party, the injured party receives only thirty-five dinars, thereby sustaining a loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no loss sustained by the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox worth five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., twenty dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the carcass </span>appreciated in value and is now <span class="gemarra-regular">worth thirty dinars, </span>more than the ox was worth when it was alive, in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage also takes </span>a share <span class="gemarra-regular">of the increased value, </span>since the injured party ends up not having sustained any financial loss, as he receives a share of ten dinars in the belligerent ox and another fifteen in the carcass, gaining five dinars over the value of his ox.
It is to counter this claim that Rabbi Yehuda adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: “He shall pay,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays, and the owner does not take </span>more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.
§ With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that the two owners split the value of both the belligerent ox and the dead ox between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to Rava: If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we find </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox gores an ox that is worth less than it, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays more than half the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But the Torah stated: “Then they shall sel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the live ox, and divide its monetary value” </span>(Exodus 21:35).
Rava answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that only the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>value of the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that was diminished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>is compensated for by <span class="gemarra-regular">dividing the live </span>ox between the two parties. The liable party never pays more than half the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does Rabbi Yehuda derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass they shall also divide” </span>(Exodus 21:35), from which Rabbi Meir derived it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">derive from </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the live </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and half the dead </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the live </span>ox and <span class="gemarra-regular">half the dead </span>ox?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if that is the only <span class="it-text">halakha</span> indicated by this clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">write: And the carcass </span>they shall divide. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the reason that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“also” </span>is added? It is added so that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude two </span>conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the clause: That the carcass is also divided between the two parties, and that the liable party is never required to pay more than half the damage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>are cases where one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for an act of </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox, but exempt </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>if he performed it <span class="gemarra-regular">himself. </span>Conversely, there are also cases where one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for the action of his ox, but liable for his own action.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox caused </span>a person<span class="gemarra-regular"> humilation,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox blinded the eye of his slave or knocked out his</span> slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">tooth, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from having to emancipate the slave for this mutilation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to emancipate him, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 21:26–27).
By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox injured </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father or his mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">injured his father or his mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">set fire to a haystack on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying damages. He is exempt from payment in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty for injuring his father or mother or for desecrating Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who performs </span>labor <span class="gemarra-regular">destructively </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">except for one who injures </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">or kindles </span>a fire. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that deems one liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">injuring </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">or kindling </span>a fire on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a mishna </span>and should be ignored. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that it is a mishna, one who injures </span>another would be liable only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he requires </span>the blood to give <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who kindles </span>a fire would be liable only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he requires its ashes. </span>In these cases, the act is not purely destructive but has some constructive purpose.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">set fire to a haystack on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>set the fire in a scenario that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his ox </span>did so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his ox </span>set the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need </span>the ashes, as an ox does not act with such intentions, 

Daf 35a

<span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>set the fire, it is presumably a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not need </span>the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nevertheless, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt because he is sentenced to death. </span>Apparently, one who lights a fire on Shabbat is liable even if he does not need the ashes, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the comparison is the other way around; the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>set the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>set the fire. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>is liable for lighting a fire on Shabbat is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where he needs </span>the ashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>setting fire to the haystack is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where it needs </span>the ashes.
The Gemara asks: In the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>set the fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find these </span>circumstances, where it did so because it needed the ashes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avya said to him: Here we are dealing with an intelligent ox that was bitten on its back and wants to burn down</span> the haystack <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">roll around [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iggandar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the ashes </span>in order to heal the bite.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we know </span>that this is the reason that it set the fire? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because after </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>the haystack, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was rolling around </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the ashes.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, as a certain ox that was at the house of Rav Pappa had a toothache. It went inside, and broke the lid </span>of a utensil, <span class="gemarra-regular">and drank the liquor </span>inside <span class="gemarra-regular">and was cured</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Evidently there are oxen with this level of intelligence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said before Rav Pappa: How can you say </span>that the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox is similar to </span>the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">him? But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox caused </span>a person<span class="gemarra-regular"> humiliation</span>, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he humiliated </span>someone, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>If the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox is </span>understood to be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">him, how can you find </span>a case where the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to humiliate </span>the person? One is liable for humiliating someone only when he intends to do so, and an ox never has intention to humiliate.
The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to cause injury. </span>If it was the action of a person, he would be liable for the humiliation he caused as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Master said: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a person intended to cause injury, </span>he is liable for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he did not intend to humiliate </span>his victim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span> a different solution with regard to the difficulty that the mishna poses to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where one lit a fire on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally. </span>Although he is not liable to receive the death penalty, nevertheless, since he performed a prohibited action that would carry the death penalty were it to be performed deliberately, he is still exempt from monetary restitution.
The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: </span>The verse states: “And he who kills an animal shall pay for it, and he who kills a man shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who kills a man and one who kills an animal </span>are comparable.
This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who kills an animal, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not differentiate </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally or whether </span>he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently, whether by way of descent or by way of ascent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and this was not <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt him from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>in all these cases but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather to render him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">restitution, </span>as one who kills an animal is liable in any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">similarly, with regard to one who kills a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not differentiate </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally or unintentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether by way of descent or by way of ascent, </span>and this was not <span class="gemarra-regular">to render him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>for the damage he causes in the process of killing him, but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather to exempt him from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>in any event. It is derived from here that one who commits a transgression carrying the death penalty is exempt from paying damages for his action, even if he is not in practice given the death penalty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to Rava: Can you </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>the mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the transgression was <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentional? But doesn’t it teach </span>that the transgressor is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is sentenced to death, </span>which is only the case if the transgression was intentional?
Rava answered that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying:</span> He is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>when this action is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>the transgressor is liable to be <span class="gemarra-regular">sentenced to death. And what are the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances </span>in which one is liable to receive the death penalty for deliberately lighting a fire on Shabbat? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he needs the ashes. </span>Therefore, even <span class="gemarra-regular">now, when </span>the transgression was <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentional, he is exempt </span>from paying damages.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that was pursuing another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ox being pursued <span class="gemarra-regular">became injured, </span>but there are no witnesses as to how it was injured, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the owner of the injured ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the pursuing ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your ox injured </span>my ox, and you are liable to pay me damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the owner of the pursuing ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; rather, it was hurt by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rock</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and I am not liable, then in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rests upon the claimant. </span>As long as the owner of the injured ox cannot prove that the injury was inflicted by the pursuing ox, the owner of the pursuing ox is not liable.
In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>oxen, belonging to two different owners, <span class="gemarra-regular">were pursuing on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> ox belonging to a third person, and that ox was injured by one of the pursuing oxen, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the owner of one of the pursuing oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the other: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">your ox </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the injury, and that </span>one, the owner of the other pursuing ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>No, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">your ox </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the injury, </span>

Daf 35b

<span class="gemarra-regular">the two of them are exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since each of them rejects the claim of the injured party that his ox caused the injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">If both </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to one person, both are liable, </span>as will be explained in the Gemara.
If the pursuing oxen both belonged to one person, and were both innocuous, so that restitution is paid exclusively from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one was large and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one small</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in this case, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, </span>and he is therefore entitled to receive restitution for half the damage from the value of the large ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, </span>and half of its value is not sufficient to cover half the damage; or, similarly, in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is innocuous and one is forewarned, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, </span>and the injured party is therefore eligible to receive full damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, </span>in which case he is liable to pay only half the damage; in both of the above cases, the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</span>
If the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">were two </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">one large and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one small, and the ones that caused the damage </span>were also <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">one large and one small, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: The large one injured the large one and the small one injured</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the small one, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small one </span>injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one, </span>in which case, if half the value of the belligerent ox does not cover half the damage, he is not required to pay more, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the large one </span>injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one;</span> or, similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the belligerent oxen was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous and one forewarned, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">injured the large </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one; </span>here too, <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rests upon the claimant.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna rules that in a case where there is uncertainty with regard to whether it was the pursuing ox that caused the injury to the other ox, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the colleagues of Sumakhos, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">property of uncertain ownership is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with his </span>opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Does Sumakhos state </span>this principle <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim, i.e., where both parties maintain the certainty of their claims, as appears to be the case in the mishna? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, Sumakhos says </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that the mishna </span>is referring to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the owner of the injured ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Your ox injured </span>my ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the owner of the pursuing ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: No, </span>indicating that both make their claims with certainty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to this </span>interpretation of the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the suggestion <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the case in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna is one where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain</span> claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>the subsequent clause in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>is referring to a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim.
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was large and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one small, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is innocuous and one is forewarned, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, the burden of proof rests upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the claimant.</span>
This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not bring proof, he takes </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to what the one liable for damage says. </span>If it is a case where both parties maintain certainty of their claims, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation of </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Natan, who says </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">claims </span>that another owes him <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which he claims he deposited with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that he owes <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> barley, </span>which is less expensive than wheat, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from any payment, since he did not admit to what was claimed, and what he did admit was not claimed. Similarly, here, the injured party claims that it was the large ox that injured his ox, and the defendant admits that his small ox caused the injury, but not the large ox. His admission does not correspond to the claim. Yet, he is apparently liable to pay according to his admission, contrary to the ruling of Rabba bar Natan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this clause must be referring to a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and an uncertain </span>claim, i.e., one party maintains certainty of his claim, while the other merely states his claim as a possibility.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who states a certain </span>claim, and <span class="gemarra-regular">who is</span> the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who states an uncertain </span>claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party who <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim that the large ox caused the injury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">states an uncertain claim </span>that it was the small one, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us still say that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Natan, </span>since the defendant does not admit to the claim of the injured party, and nevertheless he is liable to pay compensation from the small one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">states an uncertain </span>claim that it was the large ox that caused the injury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage states a certain </span>claim that it was the small one. Since the claimant does not contradict the defendant’s admission, the latter is liable to pay the amount that he admitted he owes.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the mishna is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party states <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage </span>states <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party states <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim that it was the defendant’s ox that injured his ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage </span>states <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim that it was injured by a stone. It is not referring to a case of two certain claims as inferred above.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Sumakhos state </span>his ruling that the disputed property is divided between the two parties <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to this </span>case, where the claimant states an uncertain claim, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was necessary </span>for the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach us that </span>according to the other Rabbis it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>divided? Certainly Sumakhos would concede that in this case the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>although <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party states <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage </span>states <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party states <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for damage </span>states <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim. It is with regard to this case that the Rabbis disagree with the opinion of Sumakhos that the property is divided.
The Gemara questions this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause is not similar to the last clause. </span>Why not explain the first clause as referring to a case of two certain claims?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: A case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an uncertain </span>claim, and a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">are one matter. </span>Therefore, the two clauses are congruent. By contrast, a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim, and a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and a certain </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">are two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matters. </span>Therefore, the first clause of the mishna cannot be referring to a case of two certain claims.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>that was mentioned above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Natan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">claims </span>that another owes him <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that he owes <span class="gemarra-regular">him barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the latter is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>novel element <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>it in a mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">claims </span>that another owes him <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that he owes <span class="gemarra-regular">him barley, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>(<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 38b).
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it had been taught only <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, I would say </span>the mishna means that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the wheat but liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the barley, </span>which he conceded that he owes. Therefore, Rabba bar Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the mishna means that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">completely exempt, </span>even from paying for the barley.
The Gemara raises an objection to this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna here that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">were two </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">one large and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one small, </span>and the ones that caused the damage were also two oxen, one large and one small, and the injured party claims that the large one injured the large one, and the small one injured the small one, and the liable party claims that the small one injured the large one, and the large one injured the small one, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bring proof </span>for his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to what the one liable for damage says. </span>According to Rabba bar Natan’s statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does he receive compensation at all? The case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>parallel to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley, </span>and the defendant should be entirely exempt.
The Gemara answers: The mishna does not indicate that the injured party receives compensation, rather, that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fitting for him to take </span>compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in practice <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span>receive any compensation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">receives payment for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">small ox from the </span>liable party’s <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">large</span> ox <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>liable party’s <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>ox? Evidently he does receive payment.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">seized </span>the defendant’s ox, in which case the court allows it to remain in his possession, since his taking it was appropriate, although the court cannot compel the defendant to pay him <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
The Gemara raises an objection to Rabba bar Natan’s statement from the last clause of the mishna as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the belligerent oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">was innocuous and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">injured the large one and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox injured <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one, </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not bring proof </span>for his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes</span> compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to what the one liable for damage says. Why </span>does he receive compensation at all? The case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>parallel to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley. </span>

Daf 36a

The Gemara answers: The mishna does not indicate that the injured party receives compensation. Rather, it indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fitting for him to take </span>compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in practice <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span>receive any compensation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he receives payment for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">small ox from the </span>liable party’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and for </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>liable party’s <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox? Evidently he does receive payment. The Gemara answers: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is also referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">seized </span>the defendant’s ox, in which case the court allows it to remain in his possession. The court cannot compel the defendant to pay him <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where an ox was injured by one of two oxen that were pursuing it, if <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to one person, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">both are liable. Rava of Parzika said to Rav Ashi: </span>Should one <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>the fact that both are liable that in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous oxen that caused damage, </span>if the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds from the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he wishes, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect from </span>the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ox?
Rav Ashi rejected this inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with forewarned </span>oxen, in which case the injured party does not collect damages exclusively from the belligerent ox but rather from any of its owner’s property. Therefore, he can collect from either ox as compensation.
Rava of Parzika replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to forewarned </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the belligerent oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">was large and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">small, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the damage, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. If </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to forewarned </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">what difference does it make to him </span>which one caused the injury? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>the liable party <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of a full ox </span>in any case.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The latter clause </span>of the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to innocuous </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the first clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to forewarned </span>oxen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi: If </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span> oxen, where compensation is not collected specifically from the belligerent ox, why does the mishna state: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are liable, </span>in the plural form? <span class="gemarra-regular">It should have </span>stated: The <span class="gemarra-regular">man is liable. And furthermore, what </span>is the word <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>in the statement: Both are liable, referring to?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the first clause of the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to innocuous </span>oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that the injured party and the liable party <span class="gemarra-regular">are partners, </span>as they share ownership of the belligerent ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that the owner of the belligerent oxen is liable is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the two of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>available, <span class="gemarra-regular">so he cannot dismiss </span>the injured party by claiming that this ox is not the one that caused the injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the two of them are not </span>available, e.g., if one died or was lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can say to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go bring proof that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">this ox </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused you damage, and I will pay you </span>compensation.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that gored four or five </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">oxe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">shall pay </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of them </span>half of the damages from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if there is surplus </span>value left <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his ox after he pays that owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous </span>ox that was gored; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if there is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">surplus</span> value left <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his ox after he pays that owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to the previous </span>one. The principle is that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latest </span>of the oxen gored in succession <span class="gemarra-regular">gains. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that the division of the compensation is as follows: With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gored an ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, thereby killing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worthless, </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred dinars, </span>i.e., half the cost of the damage, from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars.</span>
If the ox, after goring the first ox but before compensation had been paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">again gored another ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, and the carcass is worthless, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>ox that was gored <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred dinars, and </span>with regard to payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous</span> goring, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox that was gored <span class="gemarra-regular">takes fifty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinars, </span>which is half the remaining value of the belligerent ox after one hundred dinars were paid to the last injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty dinars.</span>
If the ox, after goring the first two oxen but before compensation had been paid, again <span class="gemarra-regular">gored</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, and the carcass is worthless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinars, the previous one </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty dinars, and the first two, </span>i.e., the first injured party and the owner of the belligerent ox, divide the remainder, each receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">one gold dinar, </span>which is worth twenty-five silver dinars.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Apparently the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, nor in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>(see 33a).
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna had been <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, who says </span>that the owners of the gored oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors </span>of the owner of the belligerent ox, then instead of stating <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latest </span>of the oxen gored in succession <span class="gemarra-regular">gains, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have</span> stated that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the earliest </span>of the oxen gored in succession <span class="gemarra-regular">gains, </span>since the creditor to whom the ox is initially liened collects first. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the mishna had been <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>belligerent <span class="gemarra-regular">ox belongs to </span>its owner and to the injured party, who are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span>in the ownership of the ox, then instead of stating <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is surplus </span>value remaining in the ox after he pays that owner

Daf 36b

<span class="gemarra-regular">he shall return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">previous </span>ox, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>ruled that the surplus shall be returned <span class="gemarra-regular">to all of them, </span>i.e., all the prior injured parties, since they all share joint ownership of the belligerent ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, who says </span>that all the injured parties <span class="gemarra-regular">are creditors. And as for the difficulty you </span>pose, that instead of stating that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latest </span>of the oxen gored in succession <span class="gemarra-regular">gains, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated that the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the earliest </span>of the oxen gored in succession <span class="gemarra-regular">gains, </span>that can be answered. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">seize</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from it, and </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">became like a paid bailee </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to damage </span>it causes. Therefore, he is responsible for any subsequent attacks by the ox. Similarly, if the next injured party seizes the ox from the first as compensation, he becomes responsible for any subsequent attacks.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>instead of the mishna stating that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is surplus </span>value left <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his ox after he pays that owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous </span>ox that was gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">it should have </span>stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall return it to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, </span>since half the value of the belligerent ox belongs to its owner, who is not responsible for any later damage it causes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: If there is surplus </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its damages, </span>i.e., the latter injured party sustained less of a loss than the previous one, that injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">shall return </span>this surplus value <span class="gemarra-regular">to the previous </span>injured party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">touched</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on this </span>topic <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a bailee’s negligence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you interpret </span>the ruling in the mishna? Was it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael? If so, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that the division of the compensation is as follows: With regard to an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored an ox worth two hundred</span> dinars, thereby killing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the carcass is worthless, </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one hundred dinars </span>from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars.</span>
If the ox, after goring the first ox but before compensation had been paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">again </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gored another ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, and the carcass is worthless, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>ox that was gored <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred dinars; and </span>with regard to payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous </span>goring, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox that was gored <span class="gemarra-regular">takes fifty dinars, </span>which is half the remaining value of the belligerent ox after one hundred dinars were paid to the last injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty dinars. </span>If the ox, after goring the first two oxen but before compensation had been paid, again <span class="gemarra-regular">gored another ox worth two hundred </span>dinars, and the carcass is worthless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one hundred dinars, the previous one </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty dinars, and the first two </span>divide the remainder, each receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">one gold dinar, </span>which is worth twenty-five silver dinars.
The Gemara continues: In the ruling of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox belongs to </span>its owner and to the injured party, who are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span>in the ownership of the ox. Is it possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shinnana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leave </span>the presumption that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna </span>follows one opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">and follow my </span>interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was also stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon in the mishna is with regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>the ox. If he is a partner in the ownership of the ox, his consecration takes effect; if he is considered merely a creditor, the consecration is ineffective. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds that the dispute in the mishna corresponds to the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.
§ With regard to the gold dinar mentioned in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in another mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(90a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who slaps [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hatokea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sel</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> as a compensatory fine. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: </span>He is liable to give him <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who slapped another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Toviya bar Mattana sent </span>an enquiry <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yosef, </span>asking him whether the <span class="it-text">sela</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>about in the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Tyrian </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is worth four dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether the <span class="it-text">sela</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>about in the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a provincial </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>worth only half of a dinar, or one-eighth of a Tyrian <span class="it-text">sela</span>.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You learned this </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the first two </span>divide the remainder, each receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">one gold dinar, </span>worth twenty-five silver dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>monetary sums using <span class="gemarra-regular">a provincial </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> in order to calculate compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the value that the first two litigants receive <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach </span>a case where the belligerent ox gored an additional ox, so that their shares decrease <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>they reach <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve dinars and one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> apiece, which are twelve and a half dinars. The fact that he does not do so indicates that the mishna does not use a provincial <span class="it-text">sela</span>, whose value is less than one dinar, and therefore a gold dinar cannot be divided in a manner that leaves each party with whole coins.
Rav Toviya bar Mattana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is not proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">should the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have continued teaching </span>additional cases, exhausting all possibilities, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a peddle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> selling his wares, who advertises every item of his merchandise? The cases cited in the mishna suffice to illustrate the point.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>halakhic conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved it based on </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: All </span>references to <span class="gemarra-regular">coinage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mentioned in the Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian coinage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whereas </span>all mentions <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>coinage in the <span class="gemarra-regular">statements of </span>the Sages refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">provincial coinage. </span>Therefore, a person who slaps another is fined a provincial <span class="it-text">sela</span>, worth half of a dinar.
Following the verdict, <span class="gemarra-regular">that man </span>who was slapped <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the fine <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half a dinar, I do not want it, </span>as it is beneath me to collect such an amount. Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him give it to the poor. Then </span>he retracted his decision, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him give it to me, and I will go and sustain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’avri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> myself with it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said to him: </span>Since you already committed to give it to charity, <span class="gemarra-regular">the poor have already acquired i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and it now belongs to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although there are no poor </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>to acquire it, <span class="gemarra-regular">we, </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">are the hand, </span>i.e., the legal extension, <span class="gemarra-regular">of the poor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> We represent them, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: Orphans</span>

Daf 37a

<span class="gemarra-regular">do not require a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> by transferring the right of collection to the court. The reason that orphans do not require this document is because the court is legally considered to be their steward, and their debts are therefore transferred to the court automatically, even without a <span class="it-text">prosbol</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, Rami bar Ḥama taught: Orphans do not require a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">prosbol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel and his court were </span>tantamount to <span class="gemarra-regular">the fathers of orphans, </span>as they were vigilant to collect all of the debts owed to orphans. Subsequently, the courts in every generation have this status.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan the wicke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slapped a certain man. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Huna</span> for judgment. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go give him a half-dinar, </span>which is the fine imposed for such an act. Ḥanan the wicked <span class="gemarra-regular">had a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clipped dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to give him a half-dinar from it, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">there was no one </span>who wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to take i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from him to give him smaller coins for it. Ḥanan the wicked then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave him another slap, </span>rendering himself liable to pay an additional fine of half a dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave him </span>the clipped dinar as payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is forewarned with regard to its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">species</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it already gored other oxen three times, <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned with regard to other species; </span>or an ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned with regard to animals; </span>or one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to small </span>specimens of a species, <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned with regard to large </span>specimens of that species; in all these cases, if the ox gores the type of animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is forewarned, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and </span>if it gores an animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said before Rabbi Yehuda: </span>What would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarned with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbato</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned with regard to weekdays? He said to them: For </span>damage it causes on <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span> its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and for </span>damage it causes on <span class="gemarra-regular">weekdays, he pays half </span>the cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When is it</span> rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> again after being forewarned with regard to Shabbat? It reverts to its innocuous status <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>its behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">reverts </span>to normal, i.e., when it refrains from goring for <span class="gemarra-regular">three days of Shabbat, </span>i.e., Shabbat in three successive weeks.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>The version of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>states: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, referring to an ox that is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species, if it gores another species, its owner pays only half the cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The version of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species. Accordingly, the mishna is teaching that the fact that it is forewarned with regard to goring one species does not render it forewarned with regard to goring other species, until it is proven otherwise.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said </span>that the version of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>states: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, indicating that it is referring specifically to an ox that is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species. This implies that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, where there is no such proof, the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to all species. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the version of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to other species.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid inferred </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the mishna, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa inferred </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the former </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid inferred </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause, as it teaches: </span>An ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to small </span>specimens of a species, <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned with regard to large </span>specimens of that species. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned</span> with regard to other species, indicating that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to all animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that even from </span>being forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>specimens of a species, in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>thereby considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to large </span>specimens of that species, which is a more far-reaching statement, as an ox is less likely to gore large animals.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, meaning that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, where there is no proof to the contrary, the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to other species, there is a difficulty with the latter clause of the mishna.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>being forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>oxen, in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>thereby considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to small </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in general,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need it be said that from </span>being forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>specimens of a species <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>thereby considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to large </span>specimens of that species? It must be that the mishna reads: But is not forewarned, indicating that only when the ox is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species and then it gores another species is its owner liable to pay only half the cost of the damage. Otherwise, he must pay the full cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in response that even if the mishna reads: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, the latter clause is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>as otherwise it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it breached </span>the norm by attacking one <span class="gemarra-regular">of that species, it </span>is considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>the norm entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>that species, and there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the species <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>members <span class="gemarra-regular">of it, </span>as the ox is now likely to gore any of them. Therefore, this clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to the large animals of that species.
As stated previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa inferred </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the former clause </span>of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>An ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to people is not forewarned with regard to animals. Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>that the mishna states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, which would indicate that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, where there is no proof to the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to other species, then the mishna, in the next clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this, that even from </span>being forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to animals. </span>The ox is considered innocuous with regard to animals, although it is more common for an ox to gore an animal than a person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, indicating that in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard to other species, then there is a difficulty with the following clause of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be said </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>being forewarned with regard to one species of <span class="gemarra-regular">animal, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>thereby considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>other species of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals, need it be said that from </span>its being forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">people it is </span>also considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to animals?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Zevid </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The former clause </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">relates to </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">reverting </span>to its innocuous status, i.e., a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was forewarned with regard to man and forewarned with regard to animals, and reverted </span>to its innocuous status <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to animals, as it stood in </span>close <span class="gemarra-regular">proximity to an animal three times and did not gore. Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it did not </span>demonstratively <span class="gemarra-regular">revert to </span>its innocuous behavior toward <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>as it did not refrain from goring people, its <span class="gemarra-regular">reversal with regard to animals is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reversal, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">reversal with regard to animals is nevertheless </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reversal, </span>and it no longer has the status of a forewarned ox with regard to goring animals.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Zevid’s opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos says: </span>An ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to people is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to animals, due to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is forewarned with regard to people, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>that it is forewarned <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to animals?</span> The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned</span> with regard to animals, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos’s </span>statement can be interpreted as <span class="gemarra-regular">relating to </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">reverting </span>to its innocuous status, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Contrary to <span class="gemarra-regular">what you are saying, </span>that the ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">reversal with regard to animals is considered a reversal </span>although it has not yet reversed its behavior toward people, I maintain that its <span class="gemarra-regular">reversal with regard to animals is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a reversal, due to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an animal forewarned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">people: If </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has not reverted to </span>its innocuous behavior toward <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>that it has not truly reverted <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its innocuous behavior toward <span class="gemarra-regular">animals?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a proof for Rav Zevid’s opinion from the mishna: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said before Rabbi Yehuda: </span>What would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is forewarned with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but is not forewarned with regard to weekdays? He said to them: For </span>damage it causes on <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span> its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage it causes on <span class="gemarra-regular">weekdays, he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: But was not forewarned </span>with regard to weekdays, <span class="gemarra-regular">they were asking him </span>about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise, he was answering them </span>with a ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches: </span>This ox that is forewarned with regard to <span class="it-text">Shabbatot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to weekdays, the mishna would be understood as saying that an ox that is forewarned with regard to Shabbat is not considered forewarned with regard to weekdays. Is it possible that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were teaching him </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, what was he responding to them?</span> They had already stated themselves that the ox is not considered forewarned with regard to weekdays.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yannai said: </span>Rav Zevid’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">can be inferred from the former clause</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, as it teaches: </span>If the ox gores an animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is forewarned, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and</span> if it gores an animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">but is not forewarned</span> with regard to other species, this clause <span class="gemarra-regular">is explaining </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in that case, i.e., if the ox is forewarned only with regard to its species, its owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage only if it gores another ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forewarned </span>with regard to other species, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was already <span class="gemarra-regular">determined </span>at the beginning of the mishna, namely, that the ox is not considered forewarned with regard to other species, then <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>need is there for the mishna to <span class="gemarra-regular">further </span>state: If the ox gores an animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is forewarned, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>if it gores an animal or person <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Has </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not taught us until now that for an innocuous </span>ox its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and for a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage?</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa’s </span>opinion, which says that an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species is not considered forewarned with regard to other species, <span class="gemarra-regular">is accepted, </span>nevertheless, if an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored an ox, a donkey, and a camel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to all </span>of them. The ox is rendered forewarned with regard to all three species, regardless of the fact that it did not gore each individual species three times.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">saw an ox</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it, and subsequently saw another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, again saw <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it and then saw <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, and a third time saw <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it and saw <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">it is rendered forewarned with regard to alternate oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The ox is considered forewarned with regard to goring every other ox that it sees and is considered innocuous with regard to the oxen in between. If it then gores two oxen in a row, the owner of the ox is liable for only half the cost of the damage for the second ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">saw an ox </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it, and then saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, and saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a horse </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it, then saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, and saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a mule </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>it, and then saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a wild donkey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">arod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not gore </span>it, in this case it <span class="gemarra-regular">is rendered forewarned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to alternate </span>animals of <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>species.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: If an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored</span>

Daf 37b

<span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, and </span>a third <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and a camel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>it considered forewarned?
The Gemara presents the possibilities: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this last ox </span>that was gored together with the donkey and the camel, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the previously gored <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen, and </span>accordingly the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was still rendered forewarned </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to oxen, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to other </span>species it <span class="gemarra-regular">was not rendered forewarned? Or perhaps we place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this last ox </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the donkey and the camel, and it was rendered forewarned with regard to all of the species </span>it gored.
The Gemara adds a similar dilemma: If an ox gored <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and a camel, </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, an ox, and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara presents the possibilities: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this first ox</span> that it gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the camel and donkey, and </span>the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>accordingly <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered forewarned with regard to all species? Or perhaps we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen </span>that it gored afterward, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was still rendered forewarned </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to oxen, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">it was not rendered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forewarned with regard to other species.</span>
Similarly, if it gored on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>i.e., on three consecutive <span class="it-text">Shabbatot</span>, and then on <span class="gemarra-regular">Sunday and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this last Shabbat, do we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the previous <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was still rendered forewarned </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to weekdays it was not rendered forewarned? Or perhaps we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the goring on <span class="gemarra-regular">Sunday and Monday, and it was </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered forewarned with regard to all days </span>of the week.
If an ox gored on <span class="gemarra-regular">Thursday, and Friday, and Shabbat, </span>and then the next <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and </span>the next <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>after that, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this first Shabbat, do we place it </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with Thursday and Friday, and </span>thereby hold that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered forewarned with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to all days </span>of the week? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps we place this first Shabbat </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the other <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is rendered forewarned only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
These dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand</span> unresolved.
§ If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox gored </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fifteenth day of this month, and </span>subsequently gored on <span class="gemarra-regular">the sixteenth da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">month </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">that, and </span>then on <span class="gemarra-regular">the seventeenth </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">month </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>with regard to a parallel discussion concerning a woman whose menstrual cycle begins on a different day each month.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated: </span>If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>menstrual blood on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fifteenth day of this month, and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the sixteenth day of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">month </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">that, and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the seventeenth </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">month </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">that, Rav says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">She has </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">established her menstrual cycle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a month and one day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>Her menstrual cycle is not established <span class="gemarra-regular">until she skips </span>a day <span class="gemarra-regular">three times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to Shmuel, the cycle is established in this case not by the date per se, but rather by the pattern of one additional day every month. Only when this occurs for three consecutive months, i.e., when she menstruates in the fourth month, is this pattern established.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>If an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">heard the sound of a shofar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gored</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and again heard <span class="gemarra-regular">the sound of a shofar and gored, </span>and a third time heard <span class="gemarra-regular">the sound of a shofar and gored, it is rendered forewarned with regard to </span>the sound of <span class="gemarra-italic">shofarot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this first shofar merely startled [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">siyyuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> the ox, prompting it to gore, and that consequently it should not count for the purpose of rendering the ox forewarned, Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that since the ox repeatedly gored upon hearing the sound of a shofar, this sound is considered a consistent impetus for its goring.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a Jew that gored a consecrated</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">a consecrated </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored a non-sacred ox, </span>i.e., an ox owned by a Jew, the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“And if one man’s ox hurts <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox of another” </span>(Exodus 21:35). It is derived from the phrase “the ox of another” that one is liable only if it is a non-sacred ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a consecrated ox, </span>which belongs to the Temple treasury, regardless of whether the latter was the ox that gored or the ox that was gored.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the belligerent ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, </span>regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the goring ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned, </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred ox that gored a consecrated ox, or a consecrated </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored a non-sacred ox,</span> the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The ox of another,” </span>indicating: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not a consecrated ox. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a consecrated ox that gored a non-sacred ox, </span>the Temple treasury is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored a consecrated ox, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>ben Menasya <span class="gemarra-regular">hold? </span>Why does he distinguish between a consecrated ox that gored a non-sacred ox and a non-sacred ox that gored a consecrated ox? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored a consecrated ox </span>the owner of the belligerant ox <span class="gemarra-regular">should be exempt </span>from liability, as the victim is not the ox of another, but belongs to the Temple treasury. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, but rather, includes all oxen, then <span class="gemarra-regular">a consecrated </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gored a non-sacred </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">should render </span>the Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">liable as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, and accordingly, if a consecrated ox gores a non-sacred ox the Temple treasury is exempt from liability; <span class="gemarra-regular">but nevertheless, when a non-sacred </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores a consecrated </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reason </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable: Because </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya <span class="gemarra-regular">infers it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred </span>ox, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that gores </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>ox the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so that when it gores a consecrated </span>ox the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable?</span>
If this is Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya’s reasoning, then his ruling that the owner of the ox pays the Temple treasury the full cost of the damage, whether his ox was innocuous or forewarned, is problematic, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source. </span>In other words, a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived by means of an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference cannot be more stringent than the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the source from which it is derived. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>in a case where an individual’s <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>non-sacred ox gores another non-sacred ox, the owner pays only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, here too, </span>if an innocuous non-sacred ox gores a consecrated ox, its owner should be liable to pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Reish Lakish said </span>that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya’s reasoning is as follows: In principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>cases of damage <span class="gemarra-regular">were included </span>among those <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> which the owner pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that in a case of an innocuous ox the owner pays only half the cost of the damage is an exception to the rule, and <span class="gemarra-regular">when the verse specified </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” with regard to an innocuous </span>ox, it intended <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically when one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox gores the ox of <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, </span>if it gores <span class="gemarra-regular">a consecrated </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is innocuous or forewarned </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>

Daf 38a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Because if so, </span>if one whose ox gores a consecrated ox is exempt from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse write this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of another,” with regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox. One could then infer that the owner is exempt from liability in the case of an innocuous ox as well, as the liability with regard to an innocuous ox is less severe than with regard to a forewarned ox. The stating of this exemption specifically in the context of an innocuous ox indicates that the exemption is only concerning the leniency stated in the verse, that if the gored ox belongs to another person, the owner of the belligerent ox is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a Je</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that gored the ox of a gentile, </span>the owner of the belligerent ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability; whereas if a gentile’s ox gores a Jew’s ox, the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This statement is difficult <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever way you </span>look at it. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another”</span> is meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, and therefore the liability applies only if his ox gores the ox of another Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">when a gentile’s </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores that of a Jew he should also be exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when a Jew’s </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gores that of a gentile </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that the reason for this ruling is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayyatter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Habakkuk 3:6). This is homiletically interpreted to mean that God <span class="gemarra-regular">saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to fulfill, and <span class="gemarra-regular">since they did not fulfill </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">He arose and permitted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehittir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their mone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Jewish people, </span>so that in certain cases Jews are not liable for damage caused to gentiles.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that the source for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here:</span> It is stated in reference to the giving of the Torah: “The Lord came from Sinai and rose from Seir unto them; <span class="gemarra-regular">He appeared from Mount Paran” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:2), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span> the time God came from Mount <span class="gemarra-regular">Paran, </span>when giving the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">the money of </span>the gentile nations <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared, </span>i.e., it was revealed and granted <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile, </span>the owner of the belligerent ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. By contrast, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned, </span>the owner of the belligerent ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, as it is stated: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble.” And </span>another verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “He appeared from Mount Paran.”</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>another verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states, </span>indicating that the first verse is not a sufficient source?
The Gemara explains that this is how the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to be understood: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He stood and shook the earth” is necessary to</span> express <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rav Mattana and Rav Yosef </span>derived from the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> another source: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He appeared from Mount Paran,” </span>meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">From Paran their money appeared to the Jewish people. What is Rav Mattana’s </span>exposition? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Mattana says: “He stood and shook the earth.” What did He see?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah were commanded but did not fulfill, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">He arose and exiled them from their lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on account of their transgressions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where may </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred that this </span>term <span class="gemarra-italic">vayyatter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a term of exile? It is written here: “And made the nations tremble [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayyatter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Habakkuk 3:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Lenatter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the earth” </span>(Leviticus 11:21), <span class="gemarra-regular">which is translated </span>into Aramaic as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To leap upon the earth.” </span>Apparently, the root <span class="it-text">nun</span>, <span class="it-text">tav</span>, <span class="it-text">reish</span>, common to both words, indicates uprooting from one place to another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is Rav Yosef’s </span>exposition? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yosef says: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld.” What did He see? He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves and did not fulfill, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">He arose and permitted </span>their prohibitions <span class="gemarra-regular">to them.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did they </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">profit, </span>in that their prohibitions became permitted to them? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, we have found a transgressor </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is rewarded. Mar, son of Rabbana, says: </span>This is not to say that for them to transgress their mitzvot is no longer a sin; rather, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that even if they fulfill them, they do not receive reward for </span>fulfilling <span class="gemarra-regular">them.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>receive reward for fulfilling those mitzvot? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that even a gentile who engages in Torah is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a High Priest? The verse states </span>with regard to the mitzvot: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Which if a person does, he shall live by them” </span>(Leviticus 18:5). It <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated: </span>Which if <span class="gemarra-regular">priests and Levites and Israelites </span>do, they shall live by them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but rather: A person, </span>indicating that all people are included. <span class="gemarra-regular">You have therefore learned that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even a gentile who engages in Torah </span>study <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: Rav Yosef meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not receive the reward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is commanded </span>to perform a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and performs </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but as </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is not commanded </span>to perform a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and performs </span>it anyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>One who is <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and performs </span>a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">is greate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is not commanded and performs</span> it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following story in the context of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Roman kingdom once sen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two military officials [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sardeyotot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Sages of Israel, </span>and ordered them in the name of the king: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach us your Torah. </span>The officials <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and repeated </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>repeated it again, reading it for the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>time. <span class="gemarra-regular">At the time of their departure, they said to </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">We have examined your entire Torah and it is true, except </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">matter that you state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability, whereas with regard to the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The officials’ reasoning was that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is difficult <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever way you </span>look at it. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, that the owners of both oxen must both be Jewish, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even when </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a gentile gores the ox of a Jew </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">should be exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“of another” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>meant in <span class="gemarra-regular">a precise </span>manner, and the oxen of all are included, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even when </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a Jew gores the ox of a gentile </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable. </span>They added: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we will not inform this matter to the kingdom; </span>having acknowledged that the entire Torah is true, we will not reveal this ruling, as it will displease the kingdom.
§ Incidentally, it is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> died. The Sages said to Ulla: Arise; let us go console him. </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: What </span>business <span class="gemarra-regular">do I have with the consolation of Babylonians, which is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">heresy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As, they say </span>while consoling mourners: <span class="gemarra-regular">What can be done</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This seems to suggest that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it were possible to do </span>something, acting against the Almighty’s decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would do </span>so, which is tantamount to heresy. Therefore, Ulla declined to accompany the Babylonian Sages.
Ulla therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">went to </span>console Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">by himself, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord said to me, do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”</span> (Deuteronomy 2:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">What entered Moses’s mind, </span>that God had to warn him not to undertake a particular action? Did it enter his mind <span class="gemarra-regular">to wage war </span>with the Moabites <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission? Rather, Moses reasoned an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">by himself, saying: And if </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Midianites, who came only to help the Moabites </span>harm the Jewish people (see Numbers, chapter 22), <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah said: “Harass the Midianites and smite them” </span>(Numbers 25:17), 

Daf 38b

with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Moabites themselves, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>that they should be attacked?
To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: That which has entered your mind has not entered Mine, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">I have two virtuous fledglings [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">feridot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., girls, <span class="gemarra-regular">to extract from them: Ruth the Moabite, </span>who will be the foremother of the dynasty of David, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Naamah the Ammonite, </span>Solomon’s wife, from whom the continuation of that dynasty will emerge. For the sake of these women, the Moabites and Ammonites must not be destroyed.
Ulla continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">matters not </span>inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If for the sake of two virtuous fledglings the Holy One, Blessed be He, had pity on two large nations and did not destroy them, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">if the daughter of my teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">was righteous, and she had </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">potential for something good to emerge from her, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">that she would have lived.</span>
§ Having mentioned the Moabites and Ammonites, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not deprive any creature of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">reward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He rewards every person for his good deeds, and provides <span class="gemarra-regular">reward even for </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasant speech </span>by using euphemisms.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>with regard to the descendants of the <span class="gemarra-regular">elder </span>of the two daughters of Lot, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the name of her son, whom she conceived with her father, would be <span class="gemarra-regular">Moab, </span>meaning: From father, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: “Do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>a full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">battle was not</span> authorized <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that the Jewish people could <span class="gemarra-regular">impose forced labor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">angarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on them.</span>
By contrast, with regard to the descendants of the <span class="gemarra-regular">younger </span>daughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>her son’s name would be <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ami, </span>meaning: Son of my nation, merely alluding to the fact she conceived him through an incestuous union, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He said to Moses: “And when you come near against the children of Ammon, do not harass them, nor contend with them” </span>(Deuteronomy 2:19). In other words, do not contend with them <span class="gemarra-regular">at all; do not even impose forced labor on them. </span>This additional prohibition was a reward for her employing a euphemism when naming her son.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the daughters of Lot, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: A person should always hasten to perform a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one night by which the elder </span>daughter of Lot <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded the younger </span>daughter, with the intention of performing a mitzva by bringing children into the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">she preceded her by four generations </span>in having her descendants enter <span class="gemarra-regular">into the Jewish people. </span>They are: <span class="gemarra-regular">Obed, </span>son of Ruth the Moabite, <span class="gemarra-regular">Yishai, David, and Solomon. Whereas, </span>the descendants of <span class="gemarra-regular">the younger </span>daughter did not join the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rehoboam, </span>Solomon’s son, was born, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite” </span>(I Kings 14:31).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a Samaritan, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a Samaritan that gored the ox of a Jew, </span>if the Samaritan’s ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, and </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, he pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>Accordingly, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to Samaritans is not identical to that of a gentile, who is liable to pay the full cost of the damage even for the act of an innocuous ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a Samaritan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a Samaritan that gored the ox of a Jew, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>like a gentile.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans are converts </span>who had converted due to fear <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the original conversion of the Samaritans was under duress and consequently meaningless, and therefore he assigns to them the same status as gentiles with regard to liability for damages?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>to this suggestion from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nidda</span> 56b): <span class="gemarra-regular">All bloodstained </span>clothes, presumably from menstrual blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">that come from </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are ritually pure, </span>since most of the residents there are gentiles, and the bloodstains of gentile women are not ritually impure. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">impure because, </span>in his opinion, the inhabitants of Rekem <span class="gemarra-regular">are converts who are mistaken, </span>i.e., they converted, and they do not observe the mitzvot because they have forgotten Judaism. He holds that since they are halakhically Jewish, their blood is ritually impure.
Bloodstained clothes that come <span class="gemarra-regular">from among gentiles </span>are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">pure. </span>With regard to bloodstained clothes that come <span class="gemarra-regular">from among Jews or from among Samaritans, Rabbi Meir deems </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>as he suspects them of not taking care to keep impure clothes out of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis deem </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Jews </span>and Samaritans <span class="gemarra-regular">are not suspected of </span>not being careful about <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bloodstains.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans are true converts; </span>otherwise the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning them would be the same as for gentiles, whose bloodstains are not impure at all. This being the case, why does Rabbi Meir regard them as gentiles with regard to liability to pay damages?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says: </span>They are true converts, and are therefore considered Jews by Torah law inasmuch as in the event that a Jew’s ox causes damage to them, the owner of the ox is liable to pay damages, and if an innocuous ox belonging to them gores a Jew’s ox, the owner pays only half the cost of the damage. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir imposed a monetary fine on them, </span>giving them the status of gentiles, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that</span> Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">would not assimilate with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raises an objection </span>to this answer from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 29a): <span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>are the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">young women for whom there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> paid to their fathers by one who rapes them. Not only is one who rapes a Jewish young woman of unflawed lineage liable to pay this fine, but so is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who engages in intercourse with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamzeret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or with a female Gibeonite, or with a female Samaritan. </span>Rabbi Zeira states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind that Rabbi Meir imposed a monetary fine on them </span>to render them like gentiles, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, let us fine </span>a female Samaritan who is raped, by rendering her ineligible to receive the fine for rape, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>people will not consider them regular Jews and <span class="gemarra-regular">will not assimilate with them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>According to Rabbi Meir, the reason the Sages did not revoke this fine is <span class="gemarra-regular">in order</span>

Daf 39a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sinner, </span>i.e., the rapist, <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be rewarded.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him give </span>the fine <span class="gemarra-regular">to the poor </span>instead of to the Samaritan who he raped, to prevent assimilation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said: </span>This is not done, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is money that has no claimants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since one would not be liable to give it to a specific poor person, the rapist could evade payment by responding to any claimant that he wants to give it to a different poor person. The Sages upheld the Torah law as it stands, and the fine is given to the Samaritan so that the sinner will not benefit.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ox of </span>a halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent person gored an ox of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deaf-mute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, or a minor, </span>all of whom are not considered halakhically competent, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damages. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored an ox of </span>a halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent person,</span> the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If an ox belonging to a deaf-mute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an imbecile, or a minor gored </span>another ox and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">the court appoints a steward for them and warns them </span>with regard to the ox that gored <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the steward. </span>The ox is thereby rendered a forewarned ox, since the steward is considered its owner with regard to the requirement of the verse: “And warning has been given to its owner” (Exodus 21:29).
If, after the ox was rendered forewarned in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">the deaf-mute </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regained his hearing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the imbecile became </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent, or the minor reached </span>the age of <span class="gemarra-regular">majority, </span>the ox has thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">reverted to its </span>status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir, </span>who maintains that the ox had the status of a forewarned ox only while it was under the custody of the steward. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: It retains its </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">status </span>of being forewarned.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">a stadium [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’itztadin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one that is trained to fight in a stadium, gores and kills a person, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, as it is stated: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">if an ox gores </span>a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28). This is referring only to an ox that gores on its own initiative, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not to </span>the case of an ox where others <span class="gemarra-regular">induced it to gore. </span>Therefore, the owner of a stadium ox, which is trained to gore, is exempt from liability if it does.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter itself is difficult. </span>First the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said: If </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored an ox of </span>a halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent person, </span>the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appoint a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stewar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">collecting </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds of the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If an ox belonging to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored </span>another ox and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">the court appoints a steward for them and warns them </span>with regard to the ox that gored <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the steward. Apparently, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints a steward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">collecting </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its body.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaching: </span>A steward is not appointed to enable collection of compensation from the bodies of innocuous oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they have acquired the reputation of being habitually goring </span>oxen, as this was not an isolated incident, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints a steward </span>for the owners, <span class="gemarra-regular">and warns them in the presence of the steward, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. </span>This is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that when </span>one of the oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">gores again, </span>the owner will be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to pay </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, and not only from the proceeds of the sale of the goring ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From whose superior-quality </span>property is compensation collected for damage caused by a forewarned ox belonging to minor orphans? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the orphans. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: From the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the steward.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not attend to the property of orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to have them pay a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interest is eroding </span>their estate. In other words, in a case where the orphans’ father borrowed money from a gentile with interest, the court ensures that the debt is paid from the orphans’ property, since if they wait to pay the debt, it will grow dramatically. Apparently, in other cases the court does not collect from their property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The court collects from them <span class="gemarra-regular">either to </span>pay a debt recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">a document that has </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">interest </span>stipulated in it, in order to ensure that the interest does not diminish the value their estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">or for </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>their interest in not paying for her <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance. </span>A widow can claim her marriage contract from her deceased husband’s property, and as long as she does not receive it, her husband’s heirs are responsible for providing her sustenance. In a case where the heirs are minor orphans, the court collects payment of the marriage contract from the orphans’ property, so that they will not have to pay for her sustenance in the interim. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that with the exception of these two cases, the court does not collect debts from the property of orphans.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that payment for damage caused by forewarned oxen is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the steward, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that it is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the orphans.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to the difficulty </span>created by the contradiction between the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">you render Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina mistaken, </span>by attributing an opinion to him that is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina a judge who delved into the complexities of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one can resolve the contradiction in another manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, do not reverse </span>the opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the resolution to the contradiction is that although Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that debts are not collected from the property of minor orphans, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who causes damage </span>to another by not safeguarding his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that compensation is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the orphans, because if you say </span>that it should be collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the steward, </span>

Daf 39b

people <span class="gemarra-regular">will refrain from becoming </span>stewards, fearing that they would incur a financial loss by having to pay for damage caused by the orphans’ animals. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says </span>that it is collected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the steward, and </span>there is no concern that people will refrain from becoming stewards, because if they pay for the orphans <span class="gemarra-regular">they are subsequently repaid by the orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when they grow up.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the matter of whether or not the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints stewards for </span>the halakhically incompetent owners <span class="gemarra-regular">of an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">collecting </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body </span>if it gores <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox whose owner became a deaf-mute, or whose owner became an imbecile, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose owner went overseas, </span>if the ox gores, <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nakosa</span> said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos said: It retains its </span>status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness until </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it forewarned in the presence of the owner. And the Rabbis say: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints stewards for them, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is rendered forewarned in the presence of the stewards.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the deaf-mute regained his hearing, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">the imbecile became </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent, or the minor reached majority, or its owner came </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">from overseas, Yehuda ben Nakosa </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos said: </span>The ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has reverted to its </span>previous status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness, until it is rendered forewarned in the presence of the owner. Rabbi Yosei said: </span>The ox <span class="gemarra-regular">retains its status </span>of being forewarned.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What did Sumakhos </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">by saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it retains its </span>status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness? If we say that </span>he meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not rendered forewarned at all, </span>and is still considered innocuous, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Sumakhos himself <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has reverted to its </span>previous status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness, </span>it is clear <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">it was rendered forewarned.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>did Sumakhos mean by saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">it retains its </span>status of <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuousness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">betammuto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>He meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">it retains its completeness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bitmimuto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as we do not reduce its </span>owner’s share of it by collecting compensation from the sale of its body. Rather, the injured party must wait until the owner becomes competent or returns. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appoint a steward for </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of an innocuous </span>ox to enable the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its body. And the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Sumakhos, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints a steward for </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and renders </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned in the presence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the steward. Apparently, </span>they hold that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does appoint a steward for </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of an innocuous </span>ox to enable the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its body.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is with regard to whether a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos holds </span>that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not change </span>it; rather, it is determined by the actions of the ox itself, regardless of its custody.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that gored </span>that belonged to <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, Rabbi Ya’akov pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did Rabbi Ya’akov do </span>that he should pay for the damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? Everyone </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>holds that one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>caused by their ox that gored, so what is the novel element of Rabbi Ya’akov’s statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox it is unclear why the owner pays half the cost of the damage, as <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he provided </span>adequate <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding for it he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not required to pay at all, and if </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not provide </span>adequate <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding for it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to pay the entire </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>Rabbi Ya’akov stated his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he provided reduced safeguarding and did not provide superior safeguarding for it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that when an ox is rendered forewarned the liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">its element of innocuousness remains in place. </span>In other words, with regard to half of the damages, it is treated like an innocuous ox, and it is treated as a forewarned ox only with regard to the other half of the damages. Therefore, half the cost of the damage is still collected from the proceeds of the sale of its body. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, with regard to another issue Rabbi Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that although superior safeguarding is necessary for an innocuous ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned </span>ox. Consequently, one who safeguards his forewarned ox in this manner is exempt from paying the additional half that he would be liable to pay due to the ox’s forewarned status. He is liable with respect to the half that he pays due to its remaining element of innocuousness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Ya’akov also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say</span> that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints a steward for </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of an innocuous </span>ox to enable the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its body. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Ya’akov rules that in the case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where a forewarned ox owned by a halakhically incompetent person is safeguarded in a reduced fashion, half the cost of the damage must be paid from the proceeds of the sale of its body.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">But do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">not disagree </span>with regard to this matter? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, that gored, Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and Rabbi Ya’akov says that he pays </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage? Rabba bar Ulla says: </span>There is no disagreement here; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">explained what Rabbi Yehuda deems him liable </span>to pay.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Abaye,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree, with regard to what</span> principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree?</span>
The Gemara answers: Abaye could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with a forewarned </span>ox whose owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not safeguard it at all </span>and that is consequently liable for the full cost of the damage.
And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">and disagrees with him with regard to one </span>issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one </span>issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that when an ox is rendered forewarned <span class="gemarra-regular">its element of innocuousness remains in its place, </span>and Rabbi Ya’akov agrees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he disagrees with him with regard to one </span>issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints a steward for </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox to enable the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from its body, whereas Rabbi Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appoint </span>a steward. Therefore, the owner is exempt from paying the half for which he would be liable due to the ox’s element of innocuousness, <span class="gemarra-regular">and pays only the half </span>damages he is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>status.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Abaye said to Ravina: Granted, according to Abaye, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well. But according to Rava, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not disagree, instead of interpreting </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have interpreted it </span>as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an innocuous </span>ox. 

Daf 40a

There are two scenarios in which the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> could be interpreted as referring to an innocuous ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one wants to interpret it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>it can be discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he provided reduced safeguarding for it and did not provide superior safeguarding for it. If </span>one wants to interpret it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>it can be discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not provide safeguarding for it at all.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">whose</span> owner <span class="gemarra-regular">provided reduced safeguarding for them, he is exempt. </span>The owner is liable only if he did not safeguard them at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov teaches us this, that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appoints stewards for </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">of an innocuous </span>ox to enable the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the proceeds of the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body.</span>
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying </span>by interpreting Rabbi Ya’akov’s statement with regard to a forewarned ox: Rabbi Ya’akov stated <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">containing two </span>elements of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ta’ama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, namely, that a forewarned ox retains its element of innocuousness, and that reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> a different explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> with regard to whether a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>in a case where the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was forewarned </span>while in the custody of the steward <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the deaf-mute regained his hearing, or the imbecile became </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent, or the minor reached majority, </span>and the ox returned to its owner’s custody. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">status, </span>the change of custody notwithstanding, and that therefore the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov holds</span> that the change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox, which reverts to innocuousness, and so the owner pays only half the cost of the damage.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Stewards </span>are liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property for damage caused by forewarned oxen under their custody, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do not pay a ranso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> if the oxen killed a person.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> that the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">atonemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for the owner of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that therefore a minor orphan’s steward is exempt from liability to pay it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans are not subject to </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>since they are not morally responsible?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse: “If a ransom is imposed upon him, <span class="gemarra-regular">then he shall give for the redemption of his life” </span>(Exodus 21:30), is referring to the monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> injured </span>party. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: </span>The ransom corresponds to the monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the one liable for the damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, do they not disagree with regard to this </span>very issue? In other words, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom is monetary restitution </span>for the damage caused, and therefore the heirs of the victim must be paid the monetary value of the victim. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>for causing the death of a person. Accordingly, the amount of the ransom is the monetary value of the one liable, since, from the perspective of his moral responsibility for the incident, he deserves to pay with his life. Although the court does not impose capital punishment, his atonement is through payment of his own value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: No, </span>it is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone ransom is atonement, and here they disagree with regard to this </span>issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we evaluate </span>the amount that is appropriate for atonement <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the monetary value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we evaluate </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one liable for the damage. </span>All agree that the purpose of the ransom is atonement.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Imposing is stated </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">later </span>verse: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <span class="gemarra-regular">and imposing is stated </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>verse, concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him” (Exodus 21:22). This verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage, the evaluation is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the monetary value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party<span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the fetus, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>the ransom is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds </span>that the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And he shall give for the redemption of his life,” </span>indicates that the ransom is redemption of the life of the ox’s owner, and its amount should accordingly be the owner’s monetary value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>would respond to this reasoning that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For the redemption of his life,” is written, </span>indicating that the purpose of the ransom is redemption of his life. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nevertheless,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when we evaluate </span>the amount he is liable to pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">we evaluate </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of the injured </span>party.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava was praising Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov before Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman, </span>saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is a great man. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: When he </span>happens to <span class="gemarra-regular">come to you, bring him to </span>visit <span class="gemarra-regular">me.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">came to him, </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Ask me something. </span>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">asked him: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to two partner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> kills a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">how do they pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom?</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in full <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>partner also pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in full, it would seem incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one ranso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> shall be paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not two ransoms. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>partner pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom and that </span>partner pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, </span>it would also seem incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a full ranso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> shall be paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not half a ransom.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">While </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">was sitting and pondering this </span>question, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov asked him another question. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna: The court <span class="gemarra-regular">repossesses </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from those liable </span>to pay their <span class="gemarra-regular">valuation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who are delaying their payments. But the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not repossess </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from those liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offerings and guilt-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> they are relied upon to bring their offerings of their own initiative, as it is assumed they want to atone for their transgressions (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 21a). In light of this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
Should it be reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is atonement, it is similar to </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering and a guilt-offering, </span>which a person <span class="gemarra-regular">treats seriously, </span>as it is in his interest to achieve atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need to repossess </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from him? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it should be reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is required to give </span>the ransom <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person, he considers <span class="gemarra-regular">it a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> financial </span>liability <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>an obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the Most High, and </span>consequently he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not treat it seriously </span>enough; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the court <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to repossess </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>as he might not pay it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it could be reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">did not sin but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his property, </span>i.e., his ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">that caused the damage, he does not treat the matter seriously </span>enough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the court <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to repossess </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from him </span>to ensure payment.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Leave me alone. I am </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">stuck on the first </span>question and have no solution, so you must not raise further difficult questions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>Even though one who borrows an ox from another is generally responsible for damage that it causes, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he borrowed it on the presumption </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>and it gored and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, the owner pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and the borrower pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered forewarned in the house of the borrower, </span>i.e., it gored three times while in his possession, and he was warned in court, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it to the owner </span>and it subsequently gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>as with regard to him it is still considered innocuous, having become forewarned while not in his custody, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the borrower is exempt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>compensation, since the ox is no longer in his custody.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">on the presumption </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous and it was found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, the owner pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and the borrower pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>should the borrower pay at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I borrowed an ox; I did not borrow a lion.</span> I did not accept responsibility for safeguarding a forewarned ox, which behaves violently like a lion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Here we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">was aware </span>at the time he borrowed it <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was a goring </span>ox and liable to cause damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him say to</span> the owner: Even though I knew that it was a goring ox, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">I borrowed an innocuous </span>ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not </span>intend to <span class="gemarra-regular">borrow a forewarned </span>ox and thereby accept responsibility for safeguarding an ox for which one must pay the full cost of its damage.
The Gemara answers that the borrower is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: Ultimately, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was innocuous, you would be required to pay half the damages. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, go pay half the damages.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it was innocuous, </span>the damages <span class="gemarra-regular">would be paid from </span>the proceeds of the sale of <span class="gemarra-regular">the body of </span>the ox, not from my property.
The Gemara answers: The borrower cannot say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: Ultimately, would you not have been required to pay me </span>back the full value of my <span class="gemarra-regular">ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> As a borrower you are obligated to return the ox to me in the same condition that you borrowed it. Even if compensation was collected from the proceeds of its sale you would still have been required to return its full value to me. Therefore, in any event you would effectively be paying for the damage, so you are not losing anything from the fact that the ox is forewarned.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>

Daf 40b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was innocuous, I would have admitted </span>my liability <span class="gemarra-regular">and would </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">have been exempt. </span>A fine is imposed only as result of the testimony of two witnesses; if the offender admits his liability, no fine is imposed. Therefore, since the liability to pay half the cost of the damage for the act of an innocuous ox is a fine, the borrower could have rendered himself exempt from liability through admission.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to the one who says </span>that payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">half the damage is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution, </span>not a fine, and therefore his admission would not have rendered himself exempt from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: If </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was innocuous, I would have smuggled it out to the marsh [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">agma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> so that the injured party would not find it in my possession. He would then be unable to collect damages from me, since he can collect payment only from the proceeds of the sale of the ox. By contrast, compensation for damage caused by a forewarned ox can be collected from all of the owner’s property, and the borrower had no way of render-ing himself exempt from liability. Therefore, it is unclear why the borrower is liable to pay half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the court seized </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> before the borrower had the chance to admit his liability or to smuggle the ox to the marsh. Therefore, the borrower cannot claim that he would have been able to render himself exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why does the owner pay half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage? Let him say to </span>the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">You let my ox be seized by </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">with whom I cannot engage in litigation </span>in an attempt to reach a compromise; the court collects full payment, and you are responsible for this situation. Therefore, you should pay the entire amount. The Gemara answers that the owner is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: If I would have returned it to you, would </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">not have taken it from you?</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you would have returned it to me I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have smuggled it to the marsh, </span>and the court would not have been able to seize it. The Gemara answers: The owner cannot say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: Ultimately, would </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">have received payment from </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of a forewarned ox, where the compensation paid is not only from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox?
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>from which compensation can be collected, besides the ox. But <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not have </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">property, what is there to say? </span>In that case, the borrower has in fact caused him loss.
The Gemara answers: The reason the borrower is exempt is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as I am indebted to you, </span>to return your ox to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, I am indebted to that </span>injured party to whom you owe compensation. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Natan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: From where </span>is it derived that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">is owed one hundred dinars by another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the other </span>person, i.e., the debtor, is owed one hundred dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">by another </span>person, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriates </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>latter debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">and gives </span>the money directly <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>first creditor, without going through the middleman, who is both the first debtor and the second creditor? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states, </span>with regard to returning stolen property: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he gives it to the one with regard to whom he is guilty” </span>(Numbers 5:7), indicating that there is a situation where the liable party pays a third party to whom his creditor owes money in turn.
It is stated at the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier (40a): If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered forewarned in the house of the borrower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the borrower then <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it to the owner</span> and it subsequently gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the borrower is exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>compensation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The last clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox; if it was rendered forewarned while in the borrower’s possession and was then returned to its owner, the owner pays only half the cost of the damage for any subsequent damage it might cause, as it is no longer considered forewarned. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that the ox retains its status as forewarned even after being borrowed, indicates that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody does not change </span>the status of the ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">disjointed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tavra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who taught this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach that </span>clause.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>follows the opinion that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody does not change </span>the status of the ox, it is inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause also </span>follows the opinion that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody does not change </span>its status. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is the reason </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>the ox reverts to its status of innocuousness: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to</span> the borrower: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not in your power to render my ox forewarned, </span>as I did not give it to you with that intention and it was your negligence that caused the change in its status. Therefore, the owner is not liable to pay additional compensation that results from the status the ox acquired under the custody of the borrower.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>follows the opinion that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>the status of the ox, it is inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause also </span>follows the opinion that a change of <span class="gemarra-regular">custody changes </span>its status. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is the reason </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause</span> the ox is considered forewarned even when in the custody of the borrower: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because wherever it goes, the name of its owner is upon it. </span>Since it was rendered forewarned under its owner’s custody, with whom it remains identified, it is not considered to have undergone a change of custody.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a stadium ox is not liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>since it was trained to gore. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If an ox kills a person it may not be brought as an offering, even if it is not put to death. If a stadium ox kills a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> sacrificing it on <span class="gemarra-regular">the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to be brought as an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified. Rav says </span>that the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>because it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">due to circumstances beyond its control, </span>as goring is what it was trained to do; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified as, </span>in any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgression was committed through it.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that interprets the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“from the cattle” </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality and </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">was the object of bestiality </span>from eligibility to be brought as an offering. The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“from the herd” </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>an animal that had been <span class="gemarra-regular">worshipped </span>as a god. <span class="gemarra-regular">“From the flock” </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>an animal that had been <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>for idol worship. The additional conjunction “or,” in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“or from the flock” </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>a person, killing him.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: If it is stated </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality </span>is disqualified from being brought as an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is it stated </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>is disqualified? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is stated </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>is disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is it stated </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality </span>is disqualified?
He explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is </span>a stringency <span class="gemarra-regular">pertaining to </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality that does not pertain to </span>one that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and, </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a stringency <span class="gemarra-regular">pertaining to </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores that does not pertain to </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality.</span>
He clarifies: With regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> is a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control like </span>a case where it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully, </span>as it is disqualified in either case. By contrast, with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control like </span>a case where it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully. </span>Conversely, with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom; </span>whereas the owner of an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pay a ransom. Therefore, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">had to state </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality </span>is disqualified <span class="gemarra-regular">and had to state </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores </span>is disqualified.
The Gemara explains the objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control like </span>a case where it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully. </span>By contrast, with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control like </span>a case where it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully. With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is this stated? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not with regard to </span>the animal’s eligibility to be brought as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering? </span>Accordingly, a stadium ox, which is considered a victim of circumstances beyond its control, is fit to be brought as an offering, contrary to Shmuel’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it is with regard to </span>the animal being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>i.e., the ox is not killed if it is a victim of circumstances beyond its control.
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable, as if you say </span>that the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the animal’s eligibility to be brought as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>how can the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> state the following: By contrast, with regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control like </span>a case where it acted <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully. Neither </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond its control written </span>in that context, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor is its willingness written; </span>the issue is not mentioned in the Torah at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the animal being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>where this distinction is indicated in the Torah? The mishna interprets the phrase: “And if an ox gores” (Exodus 21:28), as indicating that the ox is not put to death in a case where it is induced to gore; therefore, this distinction is mentioned in the Torah with regard to the animal being put to death. Accordingly, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not address the topic of dispute between Rav and Shmuel.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">gores, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the ransom, </span>whereas the owner of an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality does not pay a ransom. What are the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumstances </span>under which the owner of an animal that engaged in bestiality is not liable to pay the ransom? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>is when the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality with </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">and killed he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the process, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">it killed her with its horn, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">it killed her through bestiality?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And rather, </span>if the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality with her but did not kill her, </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not pay a ransom is </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it did not kill her,</span> so paying ransom is irrelevant; it is not a feature associated with the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of an animal that engaged in bestiality.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Actually, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality with her but did not kill her, </span>and it is still noteworthy that its owner is not liable to pay ransom, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">was brought to court, and they executed her </span>for her transgression. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say</span>

Daf 41a

that the ox should be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like one that killed her, </span>as it was the reason for her execution, and therefore its owner should be liable to pay a ransom, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in bestiality with her and killed her </span>in the process. <span class="gemarra-regular">And as for the difficulty you </span>pose: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">it killed her with </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">horns, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">it killed her through bestiality, </span>the answer is that in that case of an animal killing with its <span class="gemarra-regular">horn, its intention is to cause injury</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of killing through bestiality <span class="gemarra-regular">its intention is to </span>achieve <span class="gemarra-regular">its own pleasure.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>other case <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>Abaye and Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">trampled a child with its foot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> killing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the injured </span>party. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Abaye, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, </span>as he holds that ransom is paid even if the animal’s objective was not to cause injury or death. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rava, he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: A stadium ox </span>that killed a person <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to </span>be sacrificed as an offering on <span class="gemarra-regular">the altar, because it is as though it was compelled </span>to behave in this manner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that gored a person and </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays ransom, but </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous he is exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">the ransom.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>forewarned ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">are liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>for killing a person. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the same </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the animal killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where it killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a girl. </span>If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>and killed a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the victim’s master <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whether he was </span>a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., one hundred silver dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">or worth only one dinar.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since we kill </span>the ox for killing a person <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is </span>still considered <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, how can you find </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox killing a person?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where in three </span>instances of attacking <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">assessed </span>that had the people not escaped, the ox would certainly have killed them. Therefore, despite the fact that the ox did not kill anyone, it now has the status of a forewarned ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said:</span> Such <span class="gemarra-regular">an assessment is not </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">anything. </span>Since the ox did not actually kill them, it is not rendered forewarned even if it intended to kill. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> endangered </span>the lives of <span class="gemarra-regular">three people </span>by goring them, and they all died only after the third goring. Therefore, the ox had not been put to death.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it killed three animals, </span>which is sufficient to render the ox forewarned but for which it is not put to death.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to animals </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to people </span>as well? Certainly it is not. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Shimi said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it killed three gentiles, </span>for which the animal is not put to death.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to Jews </span>as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it killed three people who had wounds that would have caused them to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Since they were on the verge of dying anyway, the ox is not put to death for killing them. Nevertheless, it is rendered forewarned with regard to its future goring and killing of people.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an intact </span>person, i.e., one who is not a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Pappa said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it killed </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">and fled to the marsh, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">and fled to the marsh, </span>and then killed again and fled to the marsh, so the court was not able kill it before it had killed three times, rendering it forewarned.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">who had rendered </span>the witnesses who testified to the three incidents of goring as <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>result-ing in the animal not being put to death, <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>themselves subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">proven </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses </span>by other witnesses. Consequently, the testimonies of the witnesses who testified about the incidents of goring were reinstated, rendering the ox forewarned.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well if </span>it is assumed that the purpose of testifying to the ox’s goring is because <span class="gemarra-regular">we wish to establish the ox as forewarned; </span>once the testimony concerning the incidents of goring is reinstated, it is established that the ox gored three times. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if we wish to warn the man </span>who owns the ox by testifying that the animal gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">he could say to </span>the judge, after it is established that his ox was forewarned: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not know </span>that my ox was forewarned, since the witnesses had previously been rendered conspiring witnesses. The Gemara answers: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Each time his ox killed </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">he was standing by it, </span>so that he cannot claim ignorance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized the owner of the o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but did not recognize the ox </span>itself. Therefore, with regard to the first incidents of goring, they testified that it was his ox that gored, but they did not testify with regard to the ox itself. That is why the ox was not put to death. Only afterward did they realize that this was the ox that had gored three times previously.
The Gemara asks: If so, why is the ox rendered forewarned? <span class="gemarra-regular">What could </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">have done </span>to prevent it from goring again, as he did not know which of his oxen had gored? The Gemara answers that it is rendered forewarned <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the court effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have </span>a habitually <span class="gemarra-regular">goring ox in your herd, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">you must safeguard your entire herd.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>forewarned ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">are liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death. The Sages taught: </span>We learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is stated </span>with regard to an ox that killed a person: “And if an ox gores a man or a woman, that they die, <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox shall be stoned, </span>and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t I know </span>from this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the stoning makes it an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat </span>an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten”? The verse is telling you that </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if one slaughtered </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">after its verdict had been reache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> but before it was stoned, it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to eat </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that one is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived that one is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from the ox as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “But the owner of the ox shall be clear.”</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the inference? </span>How is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from the statement that the owner shall be clear? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Zoma says: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a person who says to his friend: So-and-so was left clear of his property, and has no benefit from it at all. </span>Similarly, “but the owner of the ox shall be clear” means that he may not derive benefit from the ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it known <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” </span>serves to teach a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he slaughtered </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">after its verdict was reached, </span>but before it was stoned, and is teaching that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to eat </span>it? Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say that it is permitted to eat </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">if he slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">after its verdict had been reached. And this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” </span>serves to teach a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">stoned it, </span>but not to teach a prohibition against eating it, as that is already known due to the fact that it was stoned. Rather, it serves to prohibit deriving benefit from the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that would be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abbahu.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abbahu says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever it is stated: “It shall not be eaten”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">“you,” </span>singular, <span class="gemarra-regular">“shall not eat”; or “you,” </span>plural, <span class="gemarra-regular">“shall not eat”; both a prohibition </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">eating and a prohibition </span>against deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>are indicated. This is so <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the verse specifies for you </span>that one may derive benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, </span>from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit.
The Gemara continues: This is so <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the verse specifies for you </span>that one may derive benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass, </span>from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Accordingly, it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ger</span> <span class="it-text">toshav</span>, i.e., a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">through givin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> it to him as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to </span>any other <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile through selling </span>it to him. Apparently, without this explicit permission, it would be prohibited to derive any benefit from a carcass, due to the prohibition: “You shall not eat.” Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">That statement </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of deriving benefit are derived from a verse </span>using an expression such as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It shall not be eaten.” But here, where the prohibition of eating is derived </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the statement: “The ox <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be stoned,” if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” is </span>stated only in reference to the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition of deriving benefit, let the Merciful One write </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit shall not be derived </span>from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>let the verse simply state: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It shall not be eaten”; why do I </span>require the specific term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh”? </span>Clearly, the intention of the verse is to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if he has rendered it like </span>kosher <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh by </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering it </span>after the verdict, one is still <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to eat it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra objects to this: Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies

Daf 41b

only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he checked </span>a sharp piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">flint</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and, </span>seeing that it did not have any defects, <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>In that case, one could say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>by slaughtering it with a stone, <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed the equivalent to stoning. </span>Therefore, it is prohibited to eat it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he slaughtered it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a knife </span>made of metal, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibited from eating it.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written in the Torah </span>that slaughter must performed specifically with <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife, </span>which would justify a distinction between slaughtering with a stone and a knife? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 15b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters with a hand-sickle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>a piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">flint, or with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if these implements were suitable to be used for slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">his slaughter is valid?</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to Rabbi Abbahu, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that he derives the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of deriving benefit from</span> the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” why do I </span>require the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear”? </span>The Gemara answers: This is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>prohibit <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit from its hid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> after it has been killed; <span class="gemarra-regular">as it could enter your mind to say that it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">its flesh from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, </span>as the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” but <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit from its hide will be permitted. </span>Therefore, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox shall be clear, </span>to indicate it is prohibited to derive benefit from any part of the ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to those </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who expound this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” for another interpretation, as we wish to state below, from where do they derive </span>this prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit from </span>the ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hide?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They derive it from </span>the wording: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Its flesh </span>may not be eaten [<span class="it-text">velo</span> <span class="it-text">ye’akhel</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">et</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">besaro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].” </span>The verse could have been formulated: <span class="it-text">Velo</span> <span class="it-text">ye’akhel</span> <span class="it-text">besaro</span>, which already means: And its flesh shall not be eaten. The addition of the word “<span class="it-text">et</span>” teaches that the prohibition applies also to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is secondary to the flesh. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is that? </span>That is <span class="gemarra-regular">its hide.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who derives it from the statement: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” <span class="gemarra-regular">does not interpret </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>as a means to derive new <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. He considers the word “<span class="it-text">et</span>” to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥemya HaAmasoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would interpret all </span>occurrences of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” in the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> deriving additional <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to the particular subject matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he reached </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall fear the Lord your God” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<span class="it-text">et</span>,” <span class="gemarra-regular">he withdrew </span>from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <span class="gemarra-regular">His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all </span>the occurrences of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” that you interpreted </span>until now? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I received reward for </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">withdrawal </span>from using this method of exposition.
The word “<span class="it-text">et</span>” in this verse was not explained <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rabbi Akiva came and expounded: “You shall fear the Lord your God”: </span>The word “<span class="it-text">et</span>” serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include Torah scholars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any event, Shimon HaAmasoni no longer derived additional <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> from the word <span class="it-text">et</span>.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall be clear from paying half a ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although the owner of an innocuous ox that causes damage is liable to pay half the cost of the damage, if an ox kills a person its owner is not liable to pay any ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: </span>Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>anyway <span class="gemarra-regular">paid only from </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body? </span>Here too, its owner can say to the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring it to court and it will pay you, </span>i.e., you will be paid from its value. Since the ox is stoned, there is nothing from which he can receive payment. Therefore, according to your interpretation, the verse does not introduce any <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that could not have been inferred by logic, and is therefore superfluous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Is this how I </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">in your eyes, that my derivation </span>from the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> case, that of an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that is liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death? </span>Obviously no verse would be required to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in such a case. <span class="gemarra-regular">My derivation is only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the assumption that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed a person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the admission of <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner. </span>Such proof is not sufficient for the ox to be put to death by stoning, but one might have thought that it is sufficient to require its owner to pay ransom.
The Gemara asks: If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the admission of <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner, </span>he clearly would not be liable to pay ransom, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> would be <span class="gemarra-regular">admitting to </span>an act that results in <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case a person is exempt from paying the fine; so why would it be necessary for the verse to state this exemption?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>is for the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>and is not considered a fine. Accordingly, one might have assumed that even in a case where there is not conclusive testimony, the owner must pay ransom to atone for the killing. Therefore, the verse states that in the case of an innocuous ox, the owner is not liable to pay half a ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva, is this how I </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">in your eyes, that my derivation </span>from the verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> case, that of an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that is liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death? My derivation is only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill an animal but killed a person </span>instead; or where it intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>kill <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile but killed a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jew; </span>or where it intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>kill <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-viable baby but killed a viable person. </span>An ox is not put to death if it intended to gore in a manner which would not render it liable to be put to death, even if it did gore in such a manner. In such a case, the owner of the ox must pay ransom. Therefore, the verse states that if it is an innocuous ox, the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom.
These two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> cite different responses that Rabbi Eliezer gave Rabbi Akiva. <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>one of these explanations <span class="gemarra-regular">did he say to him first? Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava: He first said to him </span>the explanation referring to the ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intention </span>to kill someone for which it would not be liable to be put to death, and subsequently gave him the second explanation with regard to the testimony of a single witness, or the owner’s admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava: He first said to him </span>the explanation that it is a case where the assumption that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>was based on one witness or its owner’s admission.
The Gemara explains the reasoning behind the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">first he said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>the explanation involving the ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intention, </span>since this opinion is preferable to the other one, against which a difficulty was raised earlier. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea. </span>

Daf 42a

When <span class="gemarra-regular">he finds big ones he takes </span>them, and when he finds <span class="gemarra-regular">small ones he takes </span>them as well. Here too, although Rabbi Eliezer’s first explanation was sufficient, he added an additional response, despite the fact that it was not as good as the first.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he first said to him </span>the explanation involving inconclusive testimony asserting that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed, </span>since this is <span class="gemarra-regular">analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">finds small ones </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>them, and when he then <span class="gemarra-regular">finds big ones, he discards the small ones and takes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the big ones. </span>Here too, once Rabbi Eliezer thought of a better response to Rabbi Akiva’s question, he suggested it instead of the first.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: </span>It means he shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">clear from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, if an innocuous ox causes a woman to miscarry, the owner is not liable to pay half the compensation for the miscarried offspring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: </span>It is unnecessary for the verse to teach this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t it say</span> with regard to paying compensation for miscarried offspring: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If men struggle and hurt a </span>pregnant <span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>and her offspring emerge, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22); from which it is inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">men </span>who cause a woman to miscarry are liable to pay compensation for the offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen </span>who cause a woman to miscarry is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable?
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva is saying well; </span>he states a reasonable objection. What would Rabbi Yosei HaGelili have responded to him?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ulla, son of Rav Idi, said: It was necessary </span>for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that this inference should be limited, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Men </span>are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen that are comparable to men </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. Only some oxen are excluded from this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as men are </span>categorically considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, so too </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen, </span>which are contrasted with men in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of miscarriage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">would be liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One wrote </span>with regard to an innocuous ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>to teach us <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said, </span>in objection to this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">The native is on the groun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the stranger is in the heavens. </span>The aforementioned suggestion contradicts the principle that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a forewarned ox is more stringent than that of an innocuous ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different way for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili to counter Rabbi Akiva’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">men </span>are liable to pay for miscarried offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen that are comparable to men </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as men are </span>categorically considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, so too </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen, </span>which are contrasted with men in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And for </span>miscarriage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous oxen, </span>their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>due to an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One then wrote </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span>innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox shall be clear,</span> indicating that only for <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox is one <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation for miscarried offspring, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: If that is so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>which is derived from the verse: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one drew near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who smites him, and extended her hand, and grabbed his genitals” (Deuteronomy 25:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say this as well: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">men </span>are liable to pay for humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen that are comparable to men </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as men are </span>categorically considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, so too </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen, </span>which are contrasted with men in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And for </span>humiliation caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous oxen, </span>their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>due to an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One then wrote </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the </span>innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox shall be clear, </span>indicating that only for <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous</span> ox is one <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation for humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>that is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He is exempt </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring and from </span>paying compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation.</span>
Rava then retracted this explanation of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye and Rava both say </span>that Rabbi Akiva’s inference is correct, according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, but with regard to the continuation of the verse: “But if any harm follows, you shall give life for life” (Exodus 21:22). With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">men, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no harm </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the woman, </span>i.e., she is not killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall be punished </span>financially and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is harm </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the woman </span>and she dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall not be punishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This distinction applies only with regard to men <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as even if there is harm </span>caused to the woman, the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be punished </span>financially. In order to preclude this inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One then wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava objects to this: Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the issue </span>of financial liability <span class="gemarra-regular">is dependent on </span>whether or not there was <span class="gemarra-regular">harm </span>caused to the woman? Clearly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the issue is dependent on the intent </span>to strike the woman.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Adda bar Ahava said </span>a different inference: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">men, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they intended to </span>strike <span class="gemarra-regular">each other, even if there is harm </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the woman, </span>i.e., she dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall be punished </span>financially, and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But <span class="gemarra-regular">when they intended to </span>strike <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman herself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they shall not be punished </span>financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this distinction does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as even if they intended to </span>strike <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman herself, </span>their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be punished. </span>In order to preclude this inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, when Rav Ḥaggai came from the South, he came and brought a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his hand </span>that interprets the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Adda bar Ahava.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear” </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says:</span> This statement teaches that if an innocuous ox kills a Canaanite slave, its owner shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">clear from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for the slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> unlike the case of a forewarned ox that killed a Canaanite slave, where the ox’s owner is liable. 

Daf 42b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let Rabbi Akiva say to himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> the same objection that he raised against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation of the verse, that the owner of an innocuous ox is exempt from paying half a ransom (see 41b): Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">itself paid only from </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body? </span>Therefore, its owner can say to the slave’s owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring it to court and you will be paid from it. </span>Since the ox was stoned, there is nothing from which he can collect payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: </span>Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation is applicable in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where its owner slaughtered it first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> before it was sentenced to stoning. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the slave’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should be paid from </span>the value of the flesh, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was subject to be killed, although </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it, </span>the slave’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be paid from it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>why did Rabbi Akiva raise this objection against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation? <span class="gemarra-regular">According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Eliezer as well, </span>it could be explained as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it first.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, </span>Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation could also be explained in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason Rabbi Akiva raised this objection was because <span class="gemarra-regular">he reasons: Perhaps </span>Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">has another explanation that is better than this one, and will state it.</span> Rabbi Eliezer did in fact respond with another explanation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let Rabbi Eliezer also answer him that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it first. </span>Why did he offer a different explanation? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Specifically there, </span>in the case Rabbi Eliezer referred to in his explanation, namely, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">animal but killed a person </span>instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the ox was not subject to be killed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at all, </span>it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should be liable </span>to pay half a ransom from the ox’s body. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is necessary to exclude </span>the owner from liability to pay half a ransom. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, since </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was initially subject to be killed, a verse is not necessary </span>to teach that the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he slaughtered it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Akiva also, certainly it is so, </span>that a verse is not necessary to teach that if the owner slaughters the ox before its verdict he is exempt from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Asi said: </span>The above explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation should be rejected, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I heard this </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">statement from a great man, and who is he? </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. </span>This is what he said: It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva says </span>in the mishna (33a) that in a case where a person and an innocuous ox damaged each other concurrently, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that injured a person also pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage with regard to the difference </span>between the two valuations of the damage, as there is no distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox with regard to injuries caused to a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for the slave is also paid from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, not from the body of the ox; just as in a case where a forewarned ox kills a slave. Therefore, its owner cannot say: Bring it to court and you will be paid from it. To counter this possibility, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>indicating that he is exempt from this liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But didn’t Rabbi Akiva </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">break </span>the force of <span class="gemarra-regular">his fist, </span>i.e., qualify this opinion of his? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the owner of an innocuous ox that injured a person <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, the same as the owner of a forewarned ox. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 21:31), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>restitution exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not pay from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property, as the word <span class="it-text">lo</span> also means: To it. This negates Rav Asi’s explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: The verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>because it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since I, </span>referring to the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">am more stringent with regard to </span>a forewarned ox that kills a person in the case of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave than </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman; as </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> in ransom, and if he was worth <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives thirty; but </span>in the case of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>the Torah imposes a fixed amount, so even if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>only one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives thirt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="it-text">sela</span>, therefore, since the Torah is more stringent in the case of a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for the slave should also be paid from </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property. To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>indicating that payment is not required in a case where an innocuous ox kills a slave.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>to Rabbi Akiva’s statement. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that with regard to the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Akiva says: </span>He shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">clear from payment for </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave.</span>
Rabbi Akiva discusses this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>could this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be derived through <span class="gemarra-regular">logical inference, </span>without the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the killing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave and deemed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>the killing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman</span> as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as when </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for a freeman you distinguished between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox, as no ransom is paid in the case of an innocuous ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, when </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for a slave, let us distinguish between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> could be proven through an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman, where he, </span>the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">gives his full value, you distinguished between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, where he gives only thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span> and not more, even if the slave was worth more, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that we should distinguish between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox, and exempt him from liability for an innocuous ox?
Rabbi Akiva rejects this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>one could disagree and say the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">I, </span>referring to the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">am more stringent with regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave than </span>with regard to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman; as </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman worth </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives</span> only one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and if he is worth <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives thirty. But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, </span>even if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>only one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he gives thirty </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>. Therefore, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should be liable </span>to pay for a slave killed by his innocuous ox. To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” </span>indicating that he shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">clear from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for a slave.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it killed a man or a woman; </span>the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to deem </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>the killing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>for the killing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is already stated </span>with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When an ox gores a man or a woman, </span>and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">to compare a woman to a man </span>with regard to another issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a man, </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">his injuries </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to his heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">her injuries </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to her heirs, </span>and not to her husband.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Akiva hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband does not inherit </span>from his wife? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall inherit it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">otah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 27:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the husband inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="it-text">otah</span> also means: Her. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that her heirs and not her husband receive the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to ransom,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since it is paid only posthumously and is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">considered </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to her; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband does not take </span>in inheritance the property <span class="gemarra-regular">du</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to the deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he does the property she <span class="gemarra-regular">possessed. </span>For instance, an inheritance that would have gone to the woman had she been alive is not awarded to the husband, but rather, to her other heirs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the assumption that even if it is clear that the victim is about to die, the husband is not owed ransom? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And it killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If a ransom is laid on him, </span>then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid on him” (Exodus 21:29–30), indicating that the owner’s liability to pay ransom is dependent on the ox’s liability to be stoned, which, in turn, applies only after the death of the victim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard to damages, did Rabbi Akiva not say</span> that damages due to a wife are paid to her heirs and not to her husband, just as with regard to ransom?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If an assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">struck the woman and her offspring emerge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> due to miscarriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage and pain to the woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring to the husband. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband is not </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives</span> the compensation for the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">to his heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman is not </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>the payment owed to her <span class="gemarra-regular">to her heirs. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she was </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she was emancipated, </span>

Daf 43a

and subsequently married a Canaanite slave who had also been emancipated, and became pregnant from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert</span> who became pregnant from a male convert, and both the husband and wife died without heirs, the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">gains</span> by not having to pay, since there are no heirs. In any event, it is explicitly stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the beneficiary of the compensation due to her, including that which she would have received during her lifetime, is not her husband but rather her heirs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> relates <span class="gemarra-regular">to a divorcée; </span>since they got divorced, the husband does not inherit from her. <span class="gemarra-regular">Likewise, Rav Naḥman said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> relates <span class="gemarra-regular">to a divorcée.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: If she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a divorcée, </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">should also shar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>the miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring. </span>Why should her ex-husband receive the full payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The Torah awarded the </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring to the husband, even if he </span>is not actually her legal husband but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in licentious sexual intercourse with her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although he has no rights to her property, the damages for the miscarried offspring belong to him alone, as he is the father of the offspring. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “As the husband [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ba’al</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the woman shall impose upon him” </span>(Exodus 21:22), indicating that damages are not collected by the woman, but by the man who engaged in intercourse [<span class="it-text">ba’al</span>] with her, impregnating her. Therefore, if they got divorced, the ex-husband receives the payment.
The Gemara asks: Why do Rabba and Rav Naḥman explain this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring to a divorcée? They could have answered, in accordance with their own opinions elsewhere (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 124b), that it is referring to payments that are not considered to have been in the woman’s possession during her lifetime, but rather are considered property due to the woman, which her husband does not inherit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us establish </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabba, </span>as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they collected money</span> for the damage and pain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman, where they collected land.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>with regard to the right of a firstborn to receive a double portion of the inheritance of his father, he receives a double portion only of the property possessed by his father, not of the property due to him. In a case where money was owed to the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>If the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>the debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to a double portion, since it is considered property that was already in the father’s possession. If <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected money, he does not have </span>a double portion, as it is considered property due to the father. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected money, he has </span>a double portion, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">they collected land, he does not have </span>a double portion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That statement </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the residents of the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>who limit the rights of a firstborn to his father’s property to the extent that they hold he does not receive a double portion of any appreciation in the property occurring after his father’s death.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they state </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>relates to a divorcée, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi that the firstborn receives a double portion even in the appreciation of the property occurring after the father’s death. According to this opinion, clearly everything due to the father is considered to be in his possession, whether he receives his compensation in money or in land. The same applies to a husband, who inherits the rights to inherit compensation for damage and pain inflicted on his wife. That is why Rabba and Rav Naḥman had to interpret this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as relating to a divorcée.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that killed </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave unintentionally, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying the fine of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty shekels, as it is stated: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned” </span>(Exodus 21:32). It is derived from the verse that the liability to pay thirty shekels is dependent on the stoning of the ox; <span class="gemarra-regular">whenever the ox is </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be killed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning, the owner pays thirty shekels </span>as compensation for the damage. If <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be killed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning, </span>e.g., if it killed unintentionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner does not pay thirty shekels.</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that killed a freeman unintentionally, </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom; as it is stated: “The ox shall be stoned, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is laid on him” </span>(Exodus 21:29–30). This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">whenever the ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be killed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning the owner pays ransom; </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox is not </span>liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be killed by <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning the owner does not pay ransom.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to</span> Rabba’s statement from a mishna: If a person admits: <span class="gemarra-regular">My ox killed so-and-so, or: </span>My ox killed <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox of so-and-so, this </span>owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays based on his own </span>admission (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 41a). This cannot be referring to the payment of a fine, as a person who admits his responsibility for an act incurring a fine is exempt from paying the fine. Clearly, it must be referring to a payment for which one can render himself liable through admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If so, this proves that payment of ransom is not dependent on whether the ox is liable to be killed by stoning, as the ox cannot be killed based on its owner’s admission alone.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to payment of the monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim. Although he is not liable to pay ransom, as the ox is not killed, nevertheless, since by his own admission his ox caused damage, he is liable to pay damages.
Abaye challenged this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">value</span> of the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of that mishna: If a person admits: <span class="gemarra-regular">My ox killed the </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave of so-and-so, he does not pay based on his own </span>admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if, </span>as you claim, the mishna is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim, not to the thirty-shekel fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>should he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pay?
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">I could have answered you </span>by saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">the former clause, </span>which discusses an ox killing a freeman, is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter clause, </span>which relates to an ox that gored a slave, is referring to payment of the thirty-shekel <span class="gemarra-regular">fine. But I will not answer you with a forced answer. </span>Instead, I will answer as follows: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>clause refer to the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim; 

Daf 43b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>there is a distinction between the two cases. With regard to an ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman,</span> there is a scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays ransom based on his own </span>admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what are the circumstances? If witnesses came and testified that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>a freeman and is therefore liable to be killed by stoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not know whether it was innocuous </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was forewarned, and its owner said that it was forewarned. </span>In this case, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays ransom based on his own </span>admission, since the ox is liable to be killed, and the ransom is for atonement and does not constitute a fine. Therefore, even <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses, </span>and the ox is therefore not liable to be killed by stoning for killing a person, nevertheless, the owner at least <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim based on his admission.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, </span>there is a scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay the fine</span> of thirty shekels <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what are the circumstances </span>where one would be liable to pay this fine due to his own admission? <span class="gemarra-regular">If witnesses came and testified that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not know whether it was innocuous </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was forewarned, and its owner said that it was forewarned. </span>In this case, even though the ox is liable to be killed, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay the fine based on his own </span>admission, due to the principle that one does not pay a fine based on his own admission. Therefore, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no witnesses, he does not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim based on his own admission.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states a principle: In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>his ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>his ox killing a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, whether with regard to </span>liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom or with regard to </span>the ox being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is unclear: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there a ransom </span>to be paid <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave? </span>Ransom is paid only for the killing of a freeman. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to payment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim? This poses a difficulty for Rabba’s opinion that one is not liable to pay the value of the victim for admitting to his ox’s killing of a slave.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection and he resolved it, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response, that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom for </span>his ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman, </span>e.g., where it gored <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine for </span>his ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave. And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>his ox killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a freeman, </span>e.g., where it gored <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, for a slave </span>too, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">value, </span>namely, where it gored <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses.</span> Accordingly, one does not pay the value of a slave based on his own admission, although he does pay the value of a freeman if he admits that his ox killed him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that one is liable to pay the value of the victim in cases where he is exempt from paying ransom, then if a person burns another to death <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, he should, </span>likewise, at least <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where does Rava </span>know <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not pay </span>the value of the victim if he started the fire unintentionally?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from what we learned </span>in a mishna (61b): If one ignites a heap of grain and <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bound </span>to an item adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, and </span>there was also <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave adjacent to it </span>but not bound, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the heap of grain, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay for the heap of grain and for the goat. If the <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">bound to it </span>in such a way that he was unable to flee from the fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to it, and </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">burned with it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability. Apparently, there is no liability even if he unintentionally burned the slave to death.
The Gemara comments: If this is Rava’s source, there is no proof from here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Reish Lakish say </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ignited the body of the slave </span>directly, in which case he is exempt from paying damages <span class="gemarra-regular">because he receives the greater </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">of them?</span> Since he is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment for killing the slave, he is not liable to pay damages. Therefore, this does not serve as proof that one is not liable to pay the value of a fire victim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if Rava’s proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">rather from that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (10a): The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one responsible for <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">consuming both something that is fitting for it and something that is not fitting for it, </span>i.e., both flammable and non-flammable items. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not so with regard to Pit, </span>as damages are not paid for everything that can be damaged by a pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach: That </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire, </span>one is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim even if the fire was ignited <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally. This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not so with regard to Pit. </span>This would seem to support Rava’s opinion that one is not liable to pay the value of an unintentional victim of fire.
The Gemara comments: If this is Rava’s source, there is no proof from here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>one distinction <span class="gemarra-regular">and omitted </span>another; it simply did not enumerate all the differences.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rava’s statement should not be understood as an objection to Rabba’s opinion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava himself had a dilemma </span>with regard to the matter: If a person burns another to death <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire, does he pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">or not?</span>
The Gemara elaborates on the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is specifically with regard to </span>death caused by one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, where </span>if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally he pays ransom </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally he pays </span>the victim’s monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>instead; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to death caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire, where </span>even if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally he does not pay ransom, </span>if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value either? Or perhaps, since with regard to </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">his ox </span>gored <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, although there is no </span>liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of the victim. One should say that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his fire too, even though </span>in a case where it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally he does not pay ransom, </span>when it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, he should pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value in any event.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we do not kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> the solution to this dilemma, which <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ With regard to Rabba’s statement that for an ox that killed a person unintentionally one is exempt from paying ransom, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A ransom </span>is laid on him.” <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “If a ransom </span>is laid on him” (Exodus 21:30)? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>in a case where the ox killed <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>one is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>when it killed <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>in contrast to Rabba’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>it should be implemented with regard to the fine for a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave as well, </span>and it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: The ox gores a slave or a maidservant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “If </span>the ox gores <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave” </span>(Exodus 21:32)? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>liability in a case where the ox killed a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave unintentionally, </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>when it killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave intentionally. And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but doesn’t Reish Lakish say </span>that for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that killed a slave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally</span> its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying the <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty shekels?</span>
Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you setting </span>the statement of one <span class="gemarra-regular">man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against </span>the statement of another <span class="gemarra-regular">man? </span>It could be that although Reish Lakish maintains that he is exempt, Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that he is liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he confirmed that this is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>as he <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: “The ox gores a <span class="gemarra-regular">slave.” What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “If </span>the ox gores <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave”? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>liability in a case where the ox killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave unintentionally, </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>when it killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave intentionally.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Reish Lakish, let us say similarly </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not interpret </span>the difference between the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a slave” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a slave” </span>to derive an additional <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not interpret </span>the difference between the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a ransom” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a ransom” either, </span>and holds that ransom is not paid if the incident was unintentional.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: No,</span> that is not a valid comparison. Although Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">does not interpret </span>the difference between the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a slave” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a slave,” he does interpret </span>the difference between the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a ransom” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a ransom.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is different </span>between the two verses? The terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a slave” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a slave” are not written where </span>the liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>is stated, but rather in the presentation of the case: “If the ox gores a slave.” Therefore, the use of the word “if” is warranted. By contrast, the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“a ransom”</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a ransom” are written where </span>the liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>is stated, where it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: “A ransom is laid on him.” Therefore, the superfluous word “if” lends itself to interpretation to include liability to pay ransom even in a case where the killing was unintentional.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the same </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the ox killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy or in </span>a case where it killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a girl. The Sages taught: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter” </span>(Exodus 21:31), <span class="gemarra-regular">to deem </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>the death of <span class="gemarra-regular">minors </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as for adults.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">this not </span>be derived through <span class="gemarra-regular">logical inference? Since </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders a person liable </span>to receive court-imposed capital punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing another <span class="gemarra-regular">person, and,</span> similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">renders an ox liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, </span>it should be derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as when </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders a person liable for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>the Torah makes <span class="gemarra-regular">no distinction between </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">minors and </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">adults, so too, when it renders an ox liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, do not differentiate with regard to it between minors and adults.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>could be inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render minors </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">like adults with regard to this </span>act, inasmuch as minors are exempt from liability for killing, but nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it renders </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">minors </span>as well <span class="gemarra-regular">as adults, </span>

Daf 44a

then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders small </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">like large </span>ones <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>act, as a young calf that kills a person is killed just as an adult ox that kills a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not logical that </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">minors, </span>i.e., a boy or a girl, just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>for killing <span class="gemarra-regular">adults? </span>Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this cannot be derived by logic alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>who kills <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is liable even when the victim is a minor, this may be due to the extra severity in the case of a human assailant, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">four types </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of indemnity </span>for causing injury; pain, humiliation, medical costs, and loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the actual damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an ox, whose </span>owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable to </span>pay these <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> types of indemnity? </span>Clearly, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> cannot be derived merely through logical comparison between the two cases. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Whether it has gored a so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or has gored a daughter,” to render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for minors </span>as well <span class="gemarra-regular">as adults.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And I have </span>derived this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to forewarned </span>oxen; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, it is killed if it kills a boy or a girl?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: Could this not be derived through <span class="gemarra-regular">logical inference? Since </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy or a girl; </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">just as when it renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman you do not differentiate between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox, as both are stoned, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, when it renders </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy or a girl do not differentiate between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>it can be inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman, whose power is diminished with regard to damages </span>because adults who cause damage are liable to pay, but nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not differentiate between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox that kills them; then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy or girl, whose power is enhanced with regard to damages </span>because they are not liable to pay for damage they cause, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that you should not differentiate between an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox that kills them?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">you could say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does one derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lenient </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">from a stringent </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to </span>be more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent with regard to it? If </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is stringent with regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is a stringent </span>matter, rendering it liable to be killed for killing a minor, does that mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">you should be stringent with regard to an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>a relatively <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>matter?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore,</span> there is another reason to reject the earlier opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that an innocuous ox is liable to be killed <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>killing <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman, as they are obligated to </span>observe the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>which gives them importance, does that mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">you should say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a boy or a girl, who are exempt from the mitzvot?</span>
Since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> could not have been derived through logic alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,” </span>stating the phrase “has gored” twice, to teach that it is referring both to the <span class="gemarra-regular">goring of an innocuous </span>ox and to the <span class="gemarra-regular">goring of a forewarned </span>ox, and both to <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>and to <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">injury. </span>In all these cases the owner of the ox is liable even if the ox gores a minor.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox was rubbing against a wall, and </span>as a result the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on a person </span>and killed him; or if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">animal but killed a person; </span>or if it intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>kill <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile but killed a Jew; </span>or intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>kill <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-viable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bab</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but killed a viable person; </span>in all these cases the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from being killed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>since it did not intend to kill, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from this </span>liability <span class="gemarra-regular">and from that </span>liability.
The Gemara asks about Shmuel’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>is he liable to pay ransom? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>with regard to this action? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in a different context, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an ox that was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits. Here too, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an ox that was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to rubbing against walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> causing them to fall <span class="gemarra-regular">on people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if it was forewarned with regard to this behavior, it clearly intended to kill the person and <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>contrary to the ruling in the mishna. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted there, </span>in the case where the ox was forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits, it could be <span class="gemarra-regular">that it saw a vegetable </span>on the edge of the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fell </span>in, without any intention to kill. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here,</span> where it rubbed against a wall, causing it to fall on a person, and was forewarned with regard to this behavior, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say </span>in its defense?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where it rubbed against the wall for its pleasure </span>and not in order to kill. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we know </span>that it did not intend to kill? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">fell it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was still rubbing against it, </span>which proves that this was its intention. 

Daf 44b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But still, is it </span>not a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">pebbles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is this case not analogous to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled from under the feet of an animal while it is walking, which is not considered damage caused directly by the ox, but rather, damage caused indirectly? Ransom is not imposed for such indirect killing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">gradually gave wa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> under the pressure applied by the ox, and so while the ox was still pushing the wall it collapsed and killed the person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, and </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: There are </span>cases where the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death and </span>the owner is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there are </span>cases where the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to</span> pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom but </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, and there are </span>cases where the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death but </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, and there are </span>cases where they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from this </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and from that </span>one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox kills a person <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death and </span>the owner is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox kills <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom but </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox kills <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death but </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom; </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox kills <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from this </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and from that </span>one. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states explicitly that although a forewarned ox that kills a person unintentionally is exempt from being put to death, its owner is liable to pay ransom, in accordance with Shmuel’s opinion, and in contrast with Rav’s opinion.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">injuries</span> caused by an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which the victim is not killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay for the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Shimon exempts </span>him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to injury caused by the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>payment he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if the ox gores <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">injuries </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">also liable </span>even if it gores <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon derives </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the putting to <span class="gemarra-regular">death of an ox </span>by the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>if it kills a person <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, so too, </span>if it causes <span class="gemarra-regular">injuries unintentionally </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment.
The Gemara questions the above explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let Rabbi Yehuda also derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning an ox unintentionally causing injury <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">we can derive </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for injury <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of ransom, which is another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">payment. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we cannot derive </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">payment from </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">death.</span>
Conversely, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let Rabbi Shimon also derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> here <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>payment. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We can derive </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">liability of an ox from </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">liability of an ox, to the exclusion of </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom, which is the liability of the owner. </span>Compensation for injury is considered the ox’s liability, as it is the ox that caused the injury, whereas the ransom paid is for the owner’s atonement. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning injury cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of ransom, as they are dissimilar.
§ The mishna teaches that if an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">animal but killed a person, </span>or if it intended to kill a person for whom it would not be liable to be put to death but killed a person for whom it would be liable, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara infers: If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill this </span>person, for whom it would be liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">but killed that </span>person instead, it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Even </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to kill this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">but killed that </span>person, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon? </span>The Gemara answers that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</span> (Exodus 21:29); the juxtaposition of the ox and its owner indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">as the death of the owner, </span>i.e., a person, for killing another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">death of the ox </span>for killing a person. In other words, the two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are applied in the same circumstances. Specifically, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the owner, </span>i.e., a person, is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he intends </span>to kill the person whom he ultimately kills, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, an ox </span>is not put to death <span class="gemarra-regular">either, unless it intends </span>to kill the one whom it ultimately kills.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner himself, from where do we </span>derive that he is not liable unless he killed the one whom he intended to kill? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “And he lay in wait for him, and rose against him, </span>and struck him mortally and he died” (Deuteronomy 19:11). From the term “for him,” Rabbi Shimon derives that the killer is not liable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he intends </span>to kill <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the one whom he ultimately killed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what do the Rabbis, </span>who deem the killer liable in that case and who therefore disagree with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">do with this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he lay in wait for him”? </span>How do they interpret it? The Gemara answers that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yannai say </span>that this phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">one who throws a stone into </span>an area where there are several people, some of whom are people for whom he would not be liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, e.g., gentiles, and a stone killed a person for whom he would receive court-imposed capital punishment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that there are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nine gentiles </span>in the crowd <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Jew among them, </span>even without the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the exemption from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that a majority of them are gentiles. Alternatively, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the people are gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>are Jews, derive the exemption from the principle that when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are nine Jews and one gentile. Although a majority of them are Jews, </span>the thrower is exempt from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is one gentile among them </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered fixed </span>in his place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">any</span> item <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed </span>in its place <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of an uncertainty that is <span class="gemarra-regular">equally balanced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient. </span>This is what the Rabbis derive from the phrase: “And he lay in wait for him.”
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to </span>orphans, and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>belonging to orphans that is in the custody <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">steward, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a desert ox, </span>which is ownerless, and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>to the Temple treasury, and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs, </span>rendering the ox ownerless; all of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">are liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>for killing a person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A desert ox, a consecrated ox, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died are exempt from </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, since they have no owners.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the passage discussing an ox that kills a person (Exodus 21:28–32), the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“An ox,” “an ox,” </span>repeating this word <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>times, <span class="gemarra-regular">to include</span> an additional six cases, in addition to the classic case of an ox goring and killing a person. They are: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox belonging to a woman, an ox belonging to orphans, an ox </span>belonging to orphans that is in the custody <span class="gemarra-regular">of a steward, a desert ox, a consecrated ox, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs. Rabbi Yehuda says: A desert ox, a consecrated ox, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>being put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, since they have no owners.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: Rabbi Yehuda would deem </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt even </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">gored </span>and killed <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately consecrated </span>it, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">it gored and he ultimately renounced </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership </span>over it, since at the time of the trial in court the ox does not have an owner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>did Rav Huna derive this assertion? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches two </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">a desert ox and an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died? Since he has no heirs it is considered to be an ownerless ox. </span>Accordingly, the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a desert ox is </span>the same as the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs, </span>and it does not seem necessary for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to state both cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, does it not teach us this: That even if </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he ultimately consecrated </span>it, or, if <span class="gemarra-regular">it gored and he ultimately renounced ownership</span> over it, it is exempt, just as in a case where a convert’s ox gores and subsequently the owner dies? The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>assertion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it gored and he ultimately consecrated </span>it, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">it gored and he ultimately renounced ownership </span>over it, the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: “And warning has been given [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehuad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to its owner</span>…<span class="gemarra-regular">and it killed</span>…the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). It is derived from here that the owner of the ox is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at the time of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">standing tria</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that the ox has an owner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t we require </span>that the ox’s status be the same at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict </span>as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">And isn’t </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the ox shall be stoned” </span>also referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">verdict? Rather, </span>emend the statement and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the owner of the ox is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at the time of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">standing trial and </span>at the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verdict are identical as one.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leaving </span>court <span class="gemarra-regular">to be stoned </span>for killing a person <span class="gemarra-regular">and its owner </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated it, it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, </span>i.e., the consecration does not take effect, since deriving benefit from the ox is prohibited and the ox is therefore worthless. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it, its flesh is forbidden </span>to be eaten and it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if its owner consecrated it before its verdict </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and if he slaughtered it its flesh is permitted.</span>
If the owner of an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to a borrower, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">to a paid bailee, or to a renter, </span>and it caused damage while in their custody, <span class="gemarra-regular">they enter </span>into the responsibilities and liabilities <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of the owner. </span>Therefore, if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, and </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous he pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that killed </span>a person, if its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it before its verdict, </span>

Daf 45a

<span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered legally <span class="gemarra-regular">sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and belongs to the purchaser for all purposes. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, it is </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and all the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of consecrated property apply to it. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">its meat. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee </span>charged with safeguarding it <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it to its owner’s house </span>before the verdict <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">returned, </span>and the owner has no further claim against the bailee.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">once its verdict has been issued</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sells it, it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">sold, </span>since the ox is no longer his. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrates it, it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters it, its meat is forbidden. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee returns it to its owner’s house it is not </span>considered to have been <span class="gemarra-regular">returned, </span>since the ox is considered to have been killed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says: Even once its verdict has been issued, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the bailee returns it to its owner it is</span> considered to have been <span class="gemarra-regular">returned.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that they disagree about this: The Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to items from which it is prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit one does not say: That which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yours is before you, </span>and no compensation is required. Once the deposited item was rendered forbidden, the bailee cannot return it as is to its owner, claiming that since it has not been physically damaged he has fulfilled his obligation to return it and therefore the owner has no further claims against him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does say, with regard to items from which it is prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit: That which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yours is before you.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>Clearly, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to everyone, one says with regard to items from which it is prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit: That which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yours is before you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as, if </span>this was the subject of disagreement, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them dispute </span>this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to leavened bread on Passover, </span>which is a more common case of an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here they disagree with regard to </span>the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">issuing the verdict for an ox in its absence. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis hold that the verdict for an ox can be issued only in its presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, the bailee is not exempt by returning it after the verdict, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">could say to him: If you had returned </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>before the verdict <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have smuggled it to the marsh, </span>and the court would not have been able to sentence it to stoning. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now you </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">let my ox be seized by </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">with whom I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot engage in litigation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verdict for an ox can be issued in its absence. </span>Therefore, the bailee is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he can say to </span>the owner in response to his claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, they would have issued the verdict </span>anyway, so I did not cause your ox to be stoned by not returning it to you before the verdict.
According to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>that the ox’s verdict can be issued only in its presence? The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death” </span>(Exodus 21:29), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">as the death of the owner, </span>i.e., a person, for killing another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the ox </span>for killing a person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the owner </span>is sentenced to death only <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, an ox </span>is sentenced to death only <span class="gemarra-regular">in its presence.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov </span>holds that the owner and the ox cannot be compared. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> owner </span>must be present when the verdict is issued, as people <span class="gemarra-regular">are able to present claims </span>in their defense; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, is it capable of presenting claims? </span>Consequently, it makes no difference whether or not the verdict is issued in its presence.
§ The mishna teaches: If the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee, or to a borrower, or </span>to a paid bailee, or to a renter, they enter into the responsibilities and liabilities in place of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>people who <span class="gemarra-regular">enter into </span>the responsibilities and liabilities <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of the owner, and they are: An unpaid bailee, and a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter. </span>If the oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">killed</span> people while in the possession of one of these people, if the oxen were <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>at the time they killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are killed and </span>the bailees are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom. </span>If they were <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are killed and </span>the bailees <span class="gemarra-regular">pay ransom. And </span>regardless if they were innocuous or forewarned, the bailees <span class="gemarra-regular">are liable to return the value of the ox to its owner, with the exception of an unpaid bailee.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What are the circumstances </span>in which the bailees are liable, with the exception of an unpaid bailee? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he safeguarded </span>the ox appropriately but the ox killed a person anyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of the </span>other bailees <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be exempt </span>from reimbursing the owner for the ox and not just an unpaid bailee, as they did everything that was required of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he did not safeguard it </span>properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">even the unpaid bailee should be liable, </span>as he was also required to safeguard it.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">provided reduced safeguardin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not provide superior safeguarding. </span>In this case <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unpaid bailee has fulfilled his safeguarding </span>duties; since he does not receive anything in exchange this level of safeguarding is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>other bailees, who have a greater responsibility, <span class="gemarra-regular">have not fulfilled their </span>required level of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>in clarification of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>

Daf 45b

<span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like an unpaid bailee </span>with regard to his responsibility for the rented item, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach </span>that bailees are liable to compensate the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">with the exception of an unpaid bailee and a renter.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let it teach: With the exception of an unpaid bailee, </span>as it in fact states; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it should also state that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the oxen are <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, all of them are exempt with regard to ransom, </span>as Rabbi Yehuda says in the next mishna that a forewarned ox requires only a reduced level of safeguarding. Therefore, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not appear to be in accordance with the opinion of either <span class="it-text">tanna</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who says </span>that an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>at all <span class="gemarra-regular">other than </span>slaughtering it with <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife;</span> i.e., there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner, or in the context of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the bailee, from liability if the ox causes damage or kills. <span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard to a renter, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir; and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabba bar Avuh reversed </span>the two opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught: How does a renter pay? </span>In other words, what is his degree of responsibility? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Like a paid bailee.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda says: Like an unpaid bailee.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed his ox to an unpaid bailee, </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span><span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>the bailee is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages; but if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What are the circumstances? If </span>Rabbi Elazar was referring to a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accepted </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">guarding it from </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured he should be liable. And if </span>he was referring to a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not accept </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">guarding it from </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, even if it causes damage he should be exempt </span>from payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he accepted </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">guarding it from causing damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was a goring </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">the normal way of things is that </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted upon himself </span>responsibility for safeguarding it so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it would not go and injure others, </span>since he knew that it was dangerous. But <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">did not enter his mind that other </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">would come and injure it. </span>Therefore, he did not accept responsibility for safeguarding against such an occurrence.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">owner tied it with reins </span>to a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">or locked </span>the gate <span class="gemarra-regular">before it in an appropriate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>nevertheless the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged and caused damage, whether </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from paying compensation for damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse describing damage by a forewarned ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the owner has not secured it” </span>(Exodus 21:36), <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <span class="gemarra-regular">was secured.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>An ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding</span> at all <span class="gemarra-regular">other than </span>slaughtering it with <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife; </span>there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner from liability.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir? He holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary oxen are not presumed to be under safeguarding, </span>as their owners do not ordinarily safeguard them; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Merciful One stated </span>in the Torah that one <span class="gemarra-regular">will be liable </span>even for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> innocuous </span>ox inasmuch <span class="gemarra-regular">as it requires </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">a reduced </span>level of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding, </span>such as with reins. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One then stated with regard to a forewarned </span>ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured it,” </span>to indicate that it is not sufficient to provide it with only a reduced level of safeguarding, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it requires superior safeguarding. And </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">derives</span> this requirement with regard to an innocuous ox from a verbal analogy between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an innocuous </span>ox and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox. In both cases superior safeguarding is required; otherwise the owner is liable.
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary oxen are presumed to be under </span>some reduced level of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding.</span> Since <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One stated </span>nevertheless that even for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will pay, </span>it may be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that it requires superior safeguarding. The Merciful One then states with regard to a forewarned </span>ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured it,” </span>emphasizing again <span class="gemarra-regular">that one must provide it with superior safeguarding. This constitutes </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">amplification following</span> another <span class="gemarra-regular">amplification, and </span>the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification following an amplification is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to restrict </span>its extent. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse excludes </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">superior safeguarding</span> with regard to a forewarned ox, and therefore reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that through the verbal analogy between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> innocuous </span>ox and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox the Torah compares their <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One restricted </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> by emphasizing: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured it,” </span>referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>a forewarned ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not to the other, </span>i.e., innocuous, ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t this </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary for the negative [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>statement that if the owner does not provide superior safeguarding he is liable? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, let the Merciful One write: And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured. What </span>is the purpose of the added emphasis: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured it”? </span>It is to indicate that the restriction of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> relates specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>a forewarned ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not to the other, </span>i.e., innocuous, ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that there is a fourth opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>In the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">both an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">provided reduced safeguarding, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from liability.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for his opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he derives </span>from the verbal analogy between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">goring </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a forewarned </span>ox that just as reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned ox, it is sufficient for an innocuous ox as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Rabbi Yehuda deemed only the forewarned element of </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner of a forewarned ox relates only to the additional half of the damage that is paid for a forewarned ox beyond the half of the damage that one is liable to pay for an innocuous ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> the liability for its <span class="gemarra-regular">element of innocuousness remains in place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if the owner did not provide superior safeguarding for the forewarned ox he is still liable to pay half the cost of the damage as he would if it were innocuous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> If an ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to </span>goring with its <span class="gemarra-regular">right horn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned with regard to </span>goring with its <span class="gemarra-regular">left horn.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: In accordance with whose </span>opinion is Rav’s statement made? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both an innocuous </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">and a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">require superior safeguarding? If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, why </span>did he state that the ox still has an innocuous element <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">left horn? Even with regard to the right horn </span>itself it has both elements; <span class="gemarra-regular">it has an element of innocuousness and it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a forewarned element.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Actually, </span>Rav’s statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and he does not hold </span>in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Adda bar Ahava </span>that the ox’s innocuous element remains. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what he is saying: You find an element </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">of innocuousness and of a forewarned </span>status in the same ox specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case like this, </span>where an ox is forewarned with regard to one horn but not with regard to the other. 

Daf 46a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if an ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, you do not find an element of innocuousness with regard to it at all. </span>If it is forewarned with regard to goring with either horn, its status of innocuousness is completely revoked.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>An ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>at all <span class="gemarra-regular">other than </span>slaughtering it with <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife. Rabba said: What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states </span>with regard to a forewarned ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">has not secured it” </span>(Exodus 21:36), meaning that once it is rendered forewarned the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer has </span>any sufficient manner of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding this </span>animal, and the owner is responsible for all damage it causes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written </span>with regard to a pit: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and not cover it” </span>(Exodus 21:33), <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>mean that once a pit has been dug the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer has </span>any adequate way of <span class="gemarra-regular">covering this </span>pit, which would exempt its owner from paying damages?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed</span> that is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (52a) that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropri-ately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt?</span> Evidently, a pit can be covered adequately.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye </span>rejected Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:8), which means that one may not allow a hazardous situation to remain in his house. Similarly, a person should not keep a forewarned ox in his possession, as it is dangerous. This is why Rabbi Eliezer rules that no level of safeguarding is sufficient for it; the ox should be slaughtered so that it will not cause damage. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that gored </span>and killed <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the cow’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fetus was found </span>dead <span class="gemarra-regular">at its side, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not known whether </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth before </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it </span>and the fetus’s death is unrelated to the goring or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it gave birth after </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it </span>and the fetus died on account of the goring, the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the cow and one-quarter </span>of the cost <span class="gemarra-regular">of the damage for the offspring. </span>Since it is uncertain whether the ox was responsible for the death of the fetus, in which case he would pay half the damages, its owner pays only half the amount for the fetus that he would ordinarily be required to pay, i.e., one-quarter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>there is uncertainty in the case of an innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">cow that gored an ox, and </span>the cow’s newborn <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring was found at its side </span>dead or alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not known whether </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth before it gored </span>the ox or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth after it gored. </span>When damage is caused by an innocuous animal, the liability of the owner is limited to the value of the animal that gored. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is paid from </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow, </span>as in the standard case of an innocuous animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if that does not suffice to pay for half the cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from the offspring. </span>Since it is uncertain whether the offspring was part of the cow at the time the cow gored, the owner pays only half of what he would pay if it were certain that it was part of the cow.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: This</span> ruling in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who says: Property of uncertain ownership </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">divided </span>by the two parties. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the significant principle of </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">law: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant, </span>and the disputed sum is not divided. According to the Rabbis, in the cases of uncertainty in the mishna, no payment is made for the fetus or from the offspring, respectively.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need for the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the significant principle of </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">law? </span>Why not just state the principle? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to say them <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>I am <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>that such and such occurred, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one liable for the damage says: Perhaps </span>it was otherwise, without definitively refuting the claim against him, <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>Although the injured party claims with certainty that he is correct and the defendant’s claim is only speculative, the definite claim still does not render the defendant liable to pay, absent proof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the phrase: This is the significant principle of monetary law, was necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>instances <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, as it was stated: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells an ox to another and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>to be one that <span class="gemarra-regular">habitually gores, Rav says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a mistaken transaction, </span>since the purchaser can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for such tasks. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>The seller can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I sold it to you for slaughter, </span>and the fact that it gores is immaterial.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why</span> are Rav and Shmuel speculating about the purpose of the sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">see if </span>the purchaser is <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who buys </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a person who buys </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for slaughter. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for them to engage in a dispute in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a person who buys </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and for that </span>reason, and in this instance it was unclear for which purpose it was intended.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us see </span>what the purchase price was: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he paid <span class="gemarra-regular">the price of </span>an ox fit for <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a large amount of money, then it can be assumed it was intended <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he paid the <span class="gemarra-regular">price of </span>an ox for <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering, </span>which is a much smaller amount, it can be assumed that it was sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for slaughtering.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for them to engage in a dispute in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">meat rose and </span>an ox purchased for slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">stands at the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">price</span> as an ox purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing. </span>In that case, Rav and Shmuel dispute whether the purchaser can claim that the transaction was made in error, or whether the seller can claim that he sold it to be slaughtered and the purchaser must provide proof for his claim.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>

Daf 46b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the loss to the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be reimbursed from </span>the purchasing money by returning it, e.g., if the seller spent it already, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">take the ox </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">in lieu of the money, as people say: </span>Allow yourself to be <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid by your debtors </span>even in <span class="gemarra-regular">bran</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since anything may be used as payment for a debt. In the event that the seller has no money with which to reimburse the purchaser, even if it is a mistaken transaction the result may be that the purchaser keeps the ox in lieu of having his money returned. Accordingly, there would be no practical difference between the opinions of Rav and Shmuel.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for them to engage in a dispute in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">does have </span>sufficient funds <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">to repa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the purchaser, and the purchaser demands that his money be returned as opposed to keeping the ox as payment.
The Gemara now explains the logic of Rav and Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mistaken transaction, </span>due to the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Follow the majority, and the majority of people buy oxen for plowing. And Shmuel says </span>that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I sold it to you for slaughtering, and we do not follow the majority </span>in this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">When do we follow the majority </span>according to Shmuel? Only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>determining the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>or permitted status of an item. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in monetary matters </span>such as this, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not follow the majority</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>the operative principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which Rav Yehuda stated above, that the mishna follows the opinion of Sumakhos, <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that gores a cow, and its fetus is found </span>dead <span class="gemarra-regular">at its side, and he does not know whether it gave birth before </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it or it gave birth after </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">gored it, </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the cow and one-quarter </span>of the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage for the offspring; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant? As it is stated </span>in the Torah when Moses appointed Aaron and Hur to judge the people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whoever has a cause, let him come near </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiggash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to them” </span>(Exodus 24:14). This is interpreted to mean that whoever has a claim against another <span class="gemarra-regular">should submit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yaggish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] proof to them. </span>According to this interpretation, this verse demonstrates clearly that the claimant is responsible for supplying the proof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi objects to this: Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>to derive this? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>based on <span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning that one who suffers from pain goes to the doctor. </span>Just as here the individual with the problem has the responsibility to resolve it, so too, someone with a claim against another must bring a proof to corroborate his claim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the verse </span>is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for that which Rav Naḥman </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a court <span class="gemarra-regular">first attends only to</span> the arguments of <span class="gemarra-regular">the claiman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and only afterward attends to the counterclaims of the defendant and discusses them? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “Whoever has a cause, let him come near </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiggash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to them,” </span>which is interpreted to mean that whoever has a claim against another <span class="gemarra-regular">should submit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yaggish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his claim to them </span>first before the defendant.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say </span>that despite this principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span>a court <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to the defendant first </span>and listens to his defense before discussing the arguments of the claimant. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where this occurs? This occurs in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his assets are depreciatin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> because of the claim against him. In that situation, the court allows him to present his arguments first so that he can sell his assets at their true price.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow that gored an ox, </span>and the cow’s newborn offspring was subsequently found at its side, half the cost of the damage is paid from the cow and one-quarter of the cost of the damage is paid from the offspring. The Gemara asks: The mishna’s wording indicates thatthe owner of the cow pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>thereby amounting to three-quarters of the cost of the damage. This is difficult to understand, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to pay </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>since the ox is innocuous. If the mishna states that he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">three-quarters of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, what is its purpose?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>actually means <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fourth</span> of the cost <span class="gemarra-regular">of the damage. </span>Since there are two animals that may have accomplices in the incident, the owner of the cow pays only half of the normal amount from the value of the cow, i.e., one-quarter of the cost of the damage. The other half of the payment, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>should be paid from the value of the newborn, who is the accomplice of the cow. Yet, due to the uncertainty of whether it was born before the goring or afterward, only half of that amount is paid from it, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">one-eighth of the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the owner of the ox receives a total of three-eighths of the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the cow and the offspring are </span>owned <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>person, the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">can indeed say to the owner of the cow: Whichever </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>look at it, <span class="gemarra-regular">give me half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>either from the value of the cow or the newborn, which both belong to you. Why is it necessary to give half of the payment specifically from the cow and half from the newborn? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this ruling of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary </span>except for the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the cow </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and the offspring to another, </span>and so each can claim that he is only partially responsible for the damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">came forward </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">claimed </span>payment from <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the cow first, he can indeed say to the owner of the cow: Your cow </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>property, so <span class="gemarra-regular">bring me a proof that you have a partner. </span>The owner of the cow would then have to prove that the newborn calf was still a fetus at the time and therefore a partner in the incident, in order to exempt himself from paying the entire payment of half the cost of the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case of the mishna is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where he claimed </span>payment from <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the offspring first,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>in this case the owner of the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him:</span> Since you claimed payment from the owner of the newborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">disclosed your opinion </span>on the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">that I have a partner </span>who is responsible for part of the damage. Therefore, I am not prepared to pay the full amount required, i.e., half the cost of the damage, but only half of that amount, i.e., one-quarter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: Even though</span> the injured party came forward and <span class="gemarra-regular">claimed </span>payment from <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the cow first, </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">can dismiss his </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he can say to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I know that I have a partne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in this matter, i.e., the owner of the newborn calf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said, </span>in challenging Abaye’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: One-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and one-eighth of the </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage? </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage and one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. Rather, Rava said: Actually, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow and </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring belong to one</span> person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is what we are saying: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that with regard to damage caused by an innocuous animal, restitution is paid only from the money realized by selling the belligerent animal. Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow is here, half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is paid from </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow </span>itself; 

Daf 47a

if <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow is not </span>here, e.g., it went astray, only <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is reimbursed from the offspring.</span>
The Gemara infers: According to Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason</span> for paying only one-quarter of the cost of the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not know if the offspring was with it, </span>as a fetus, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gored or whether it was not.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious to us that the offspring was with it </span>as a fetus <span class="gemarra-regular">when it gored, the full </span>amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage may be reimbursed from the offspring</span> if the cow is not there.
The Gemara comments: In this respect, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow that caused damage </span>while pregnant, the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from its offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the offspring that had been a fetus at the time of the goring. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered an integral part of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body </span>and therefore may be used to collect payment. By contrast, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a hen that caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">does not collect </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from its egg. </span>Payment can be collected only from the body of the hen. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? </span>The egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is simply a secretio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and not an integral part of the hen’s body.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>When assessing the damage inflicted by a goring ox on a cow whose newborn calf is found dead by its side, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to the cow by itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">to the offspring by itself. Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises the offspring together with the co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> and evaluates the overall damage inflicted on the pregnant cow, which will be slightly less than it would be with two separate evaluations. The reason for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if you do not say this, you </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>to have ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">weakened the one liable for damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> by inflicting a loss on him, as the market value of a newborn calf is greater than the difference in market value between a pregnant cow and one that is not pregnant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, you find </span>this principle in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> someone <span class="gemarra-regular">severed the hand of another’s slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The difference in value between a slave with a hand and a slave without a hand is assessed, rather than determining how much money the owner would request in exchange for allowing the hand of his slave to be cut off. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>this principle in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of one who causes damage </span>to part of <span class="gemarra-regular">another’s field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The court appraises not the garden bed that was eaten or trampled, but the depreciation in value of the bed as part of the surrounding area. This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</span> The main reason invoked by Rava is that otherwise you will be found to have ultimately weakened the one liable for damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if this is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of assessing the damage, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let the one liable for damage be weakened </span>by losing money.
Rav Ashi answered: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the one liable for damage <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I caused damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>through injuring <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant cow, </span>and so <span class="gemarra-regular">I am assessing </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant cow for you. </span>Therefore, it is not correct to evaluate separately the damage to the cow and the damage to the offspring.
The Gemara raises a question: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow </span>belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and the offspring</span> belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>that the compensation for the cow’s loss of <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the cow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The additional value that the cow had due to the fact that it was fatter due to the pregnancy is paid to the owner of the cow. The question is: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning the cow’s <span class="gemarra-regular">bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> There is an increase in value of a pregnant cow that it is attributed to its improved appearance, which results from its carrying a fetus. Who is considered the injured party with regard to that sum? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>This too belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the cow, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> They divide </span>the restitution. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they divide </span>the restitution.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a potter who brought his</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal broke </span>the pots, the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. If </span>the owner’s animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured by </span>the pots, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the pots is liable. But if </span>the potter <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable </span>if his animal caused damage to the pots.
Similarly, if someone <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal ate them, </span>the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. If </span>his animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">injured by them, </span>e.g., if it slipped on them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the produce is liable. But if he brought</span> his produce <span class="gemarra-regular">inside with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable </span>for the damage caused by his animal to them.
Similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into the homeowner’s courtyard without</span>

Daf 47b

<span class="gemarra-regular">permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the homeowner’s ox gored it or the homeowner’s dog bit it, </span>the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>If it <span class="gemarra-regular">gored the homeowner’s ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the goring ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Furthermore, if the ox that he brought into the courtyard without permission <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and contaminated its water, </span>the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation for despoiling the water. If the homeowner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father or son were inside </span>the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the ransom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But if he brought </span>the ox into the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the owner of the courtyard is liable </span>for the damage caused.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable in any </span>of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought into his premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself to safeguard </span>them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> From the first case of the mishna, it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the potter is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that he brought his pots into another’s courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission. But </span>if he brought them in <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, the potter would not be liable for damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard owner’s animal; and we do not say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the potter accepted </span>responsibility for the <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding of the courtyard owner’s animal </span>from his own pots.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>at the conclusion of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">any case </span>where permission is granted to allow an item into one’s premises <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>i.e., without an explicit agreement as to who is responsible for safeguarding the item, it is assumed that with regard to each party, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not accepted upon himself </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the item. Therefore, the potter who received permission to bring his pots into the owner’s courtyard similarly did not accept responsibility to safeguard against damage to the property of the owner of the courtyard.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause: If </span>the potter <span class="gemarra-regular">brought them into </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable. </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who </span>disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that, even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where permission is granted to allow an item into one’s premises <span class="gemarra-regular">with-out specification, </span>where the owner merely said he could bring them into the courtyard, the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the items to ensure that they are not damaged, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore,</span> the end of the mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable in any </span>of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought into his premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the homeowner </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself to safeguard </span>them. Therefore, it emerges that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause and the last clause </span>of the mishna are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the middle clause</span> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>Is this a reasonable way to read the mishna?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">disjointed </span>and doesn’t follow a single opinion. Rather, the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who taught this </span>clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach that</span> clause of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The beginning of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is entirely </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the potter received <span class="gemarra-regular">permission </span>to place his pots there, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the courtyard accepted </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the pots, and even </span>to the extent that if the pots <span class="gemarra-regular">broke due to the wind, </span>he would be liable. The owner of the pots, by contrast, did not accept any responsibility to ensure that his items would not cause damage.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he brought his produce into the homeowner’s courtyard </span>without permission, and the owner’s animal was injured by the produce, he is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped on it </span>and fell, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it ate </span>from the produce and was injured, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason? </span>The animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>it, and it was not the owner of the fruit who acted improperly but the animal itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: I say that Rav stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while dozing and lying down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is not entirely precise, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who places poiso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before another’s animal </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. </span>From the above statement, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically where he put <span class="gemarra-regular">poison </span>before the animal that he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is not suitable for eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if he put <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span> before it, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is suitable for eating, </span>and the animal dies from eating it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is also liable according to human laws. </span>The Gemara analyzes this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why </span>is he liable? Here also Rav’s logic can be invoked, that the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>it. Therefore, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> poses a difficulty for Rav.
In order to explain Rav’s statement, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The same is true, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the animal was injured by eating the produce, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws, and this</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this, that even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">poison, which is not suitable for eating, </span>the one who placed the poison before the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the case where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> exempts from liability according to human laws the one who placed <span class="gemarra-regular">poison </span>before the animal is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an item suitable for eating <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>such as <span class="gemarra-italic">afrazta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of herb that appears edible for animals but is actually poisonous. Therefore, this herb <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>halakhically equivalent to any other <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>for which he is exempt from liability according to human laws, since, as Rav explained, the animal should not have eaten it.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav’s statement from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who entered </span>the house of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner without permission </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the homeowner’s animal ate </span>the wheat, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span> Moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the homeowner’s animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured </span>by the wheat, the woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Now according to Rav’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is she liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>here as well that the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>it.
In order to explain Rav’s statement, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>What is the difficulty here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable to the mishna that we interpreted </span>as a scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped on </span>the produce? Similarly, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is also referring to a case where the animal was injured by slipping on the wheat, not by eating it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he who asked it, why did he ask it? </span>This answer seems obvious. The Gemara answers: The questioner could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Granted, the mishna </span>that teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">injured by them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bahen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], is </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped on them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bahen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. But here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is injured,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>the additional term: <span class="gemarra-italic">Bahen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since this case is immediately preceded by the case of: And the owner’s animal ate them, it is reasonable to surmise <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case of the animal being injured, the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>due to <span class="gemarra-regular">eating.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span>one, i.e., the one who provided the answer, could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in response: There <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>whether it states: It was injured, or: It was injured by them, as in both cases the injury can be explained as resulting from slipping and not from eating.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">ate wheat </span>belonging to the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consequently was stricken with <span class="gemarra-regular">diarrhe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and died, </span>then the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>in the latter case, is the owner liable for the damage to the ox? Shouldn’t the assertion: The ox <span class="gemarra-regular">shouldn’t have eaten </span>it, be invoked, and any injury that follows is the responsibility of the ox’s owner?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you raising a contradiction </span>from a case <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission </span>and applying it <span class="gemarra-regular">against </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission? </span>There is no difficulty here, since <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case where the ox’s owner brought the ox into the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, </span>the homeowner thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against any damage to the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ox. And even </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">strangled itself, </span>he would still be liable.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted upon himself </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguardin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the items entering his premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Did he accept upon himself only </span>the responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>and his animals from causing damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps he even accepted </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against all forms of damage that originate <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution based on <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda bar Simon taught in </span>the tractate of <span class="gemarra-italic">Nezikin</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Karna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his produce into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and an ox came from elsewhere and ate it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the phrase: He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>referring to, <span class="gemarra-regular">and who </span>is the phrase: He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>referring to? <span class="gemarra-regular">Does it not</span> mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt and the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>This would indicate that by granting permission for the produce to be brought in, he accepts responsibility to safeguard against other damage as well, such as that caused by another ox entering from the outside.
In response, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that this interpretation should be rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox </span>that causes damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox, </span>

Daf 48a

<span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason is there to rule one way where the produce is brought in <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, and what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>to rule another way where the produce is brought in <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission?</span> With regard to damage done by the ox of a stranger, it should not make any difference.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: If he brought in the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, it is </span>a case of damage under the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating </span>(see 2a), <span class="gemarra-regular">in the domain of the injured </span>party, since, with respect to the produce, the courtyard is treated as belonging to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if an animal causes damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating in the domain of the injured </span>party, the ox’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>But if he brought it into the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, it is </span>a case of damage under the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating in the public domain, and </span>if an animal causes damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating in the public domain, </span>the ox’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span> Given this explanation, the answer to the question of what type of safeguarding the courtyard owner accepted cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox from elsewhere comes and gores it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But if he brought </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt and who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? Is it not the owner of the courtyard</span> who is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt and the owner of the courtyard </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>If so, this proves that the owner of the courtyard accepted responsibility for all damage occurring on his premises.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox </span>that gored is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and the owner of the ox </span>that gored is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>significance is there to specifying the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, and what </span>significance <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>to specifying the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission </span>with regard to this ox? For damage categorized as Goring (see 2b), the owner of the animal is liable wherever the goring occurred, even in the public domain.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, who says: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, </span>and the owner of the goring animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span> According to this opinion, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be interpreted as follows: If the injured party brought his ox into the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, it is </span>a case of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the property of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the Goring animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span> But if he brought it in <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, it is </span>a case of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the public domain, and he pays only half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
§ The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who entered a certain house to bake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Subsequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">a goat </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the house came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">ate the </span>woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">dough, </span>and as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">it became overheated and died. Rava deemed </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay compensation for the goat.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rav says </span>that in a case where someone brings in his produce to another’s courtyard without permission, and the latter’s animal is injured by eating it, the owner of the produce is nevertheless exempt, since the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>it.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case where someone brought in his produce <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not accept </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against the produce causing damage, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where the woman brought in the dough <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, </span>the woman did <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon hersel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against the dough causing damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mentioned previously: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who entered </span>the house of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> homeowner without permission </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind wheat, and the homeowner’s animal ate </span>the wheat, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? And </span>moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the homeowner’s animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured </span>by the wheat, the woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>she is liable is specifically that she entered <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, but</span> if she entered <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, </span>she would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: If she entered the house <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind wheat, since she does not require any privacy,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the owners of the courtyard do not need </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">absent themselves </span>from there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against damage therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">rests upon them. But </span>if she enters <span class="gemarra-regular">to bake, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since she requires privacy </span>for this, as the process of kneading involves exposing her elbows, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owners of the courtyard absent themselves </span>from there to allow her to bake. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>the responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>against damage to anything in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">rests upon her.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox inside the homeowner’s courtyard</span> without permission and the homeowner’s ox gored it or the homeowner’s dog bit it, the homeowner is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">dug pits, ditches, or caves in it, the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the damage </span>caused by his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but the owner of the courtyard is liable for </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>if someone falls inside.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Even though the Master says </span>that when the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if a man shall open a pit” </span>(Exodus 21:33), it limits the liability for the pit to a person who digs a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not an ox </span>that digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case the owner of the courtyard should be exempt, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in Rava’s statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">since this</span> owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">should have filled </span>the pit with earth <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fill it, </span>he is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like someone who </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">dug </span>the pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">brought his ox into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">injured the homeowner, or the homeowner </span>stumbled and <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured by it, </span>the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">crouched [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ravatz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and by doing so caused damage, the ox’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt because </span>the animal caused damage when it <span class="gemarra-regular">crouched? Rav Pappa said: What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">ravatz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that it dropped fece</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hirbitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>on the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the clothes of the homeowner were soiled. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the feces constitute a pit, and we do not find </span>a case of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable </span>for causing damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils. </span>Therefore, the owner of the animal is exempt.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who says: Any obstruction is </span>categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit,</span> and the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> exempting the one responsible for the pit from damage to utensils applies to them as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says </span>that one’s property is not categorized as Pit <span class="gemarra-regular">until he renounces ownership of it, what is there to say?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: The animal’s owner usually <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces ownership </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary feces,</span> and so they are categorized as Pit even according to the opinion of Rav.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>In the case of a person or an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">entered the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and injured the homeowner, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or the homeowner was injured by </span>stumbling on the intruder, the person or owner of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Moreover, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the homeowner damages </span>the person or animal, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: We said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not know of his</span> presence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he knew of his </span>presence, even if he entered without permission, then if the <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner injured him, </span>the homeowner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the injured party can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although you have the right</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to eject </span>me from your courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not have the right to injure me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rava and Rav Pappa, who hold that one who enters without permission is liable if damage is caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">follow their </span>lines of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava says, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>who said it: 

Daf 48b

In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people who were both somewhere <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or two </span>people who were both somewhere <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they injure each othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> directly, they are both <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they were injured by one another</span> through stumbling over one another, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>From this statement, it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>both are liable if either damages the other is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two of them </span>were both there <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission or the two of them </span>were both there <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>i.e., the homeowner, was there <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission, and the other </span>entered <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission, </span>then the one who was there <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>if he injured the other, but the one who entered <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>if he injured the homeowner, in accordance with the opinion of Rava and Rav Pappa.
§ The mishna teaches: If the ox that he brought into the courtyard without permission <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">pit and contaminated its water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. Rava says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">contaminated </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of the fall. But </span>if it contaminated the water <span class="gemarra-regular">after the fall, </span>e.g., the animal died there and the decomposing carcass despoiled the water, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason? </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered as a <span class="gemarra-regular">pit, and the water </span>has the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils </span>that fall into a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we have not found </span>a case of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit that renders one liable </span>for causing damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils. </span>Therefore, he is exempt.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who says: Any obstruction is </span>categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span>and the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> exempting the one responsible for the pit from damage to utensils applies to them as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says </span>that one’s property is not categorized as Pit <span class="gemarra-regular">until he renounces ownership of it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>Presumably, the owner did not renounce ownership of the ox or even of the carcass.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated, it was stated like this: Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">contaminated </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its body, </span>i.e., its carcass. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">contaminated</span> the water <span class="gemarra-regular">with its stench, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason? </span>It is because the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">an indirect </span>action. Although the ox’s owner was initially responsible for his animal falling into the pit, the stench did not result directly from this action. It subsequently occurred on its own, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable </span>for damage that is caused <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">an indirect </span>action.
§ The mishna teaches: If the homeowner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father or son were inside </span>the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the ransom. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>does he pay a ransom? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>in which case its owner is not liable to pay a ransom? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>Here <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>an ox that is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned for falling on people in pits.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to be put to <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>because if it is forewarned for this behavior, it is considered to have acted intentionally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>in response: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it saw </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">gras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that it intended to eat on the edge of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and fell </span>in the pit instead. Since there was no intention to cause damage by falling, the ox is not liable to be put to death, but since it was forewarned for this behavior, its owner still pays ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>This ox mentioned in the mishna is innocuous, and in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this? It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says: </span>The owner of an <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox that caused damage pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half a ransom. </span>Therefore, when the mishna states that he pays a ransom, it means that he pays half a ransom.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who </span>maintains that payment of a ransom is applicable even in the case of an innocuous ox, but he <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, who says: </span>For damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>that is carried out by an innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the injured </span>party, the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. So too, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays a full ransom </span>despite the fact that the ox is innocuous.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Ulla, this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">his father or his son were inside </span>the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox pays the ransom. The mishna thereby provides a case of damage categorized as Goring in the courtyard of the injured party. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Shmuel’s </span>explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>mention <span class="gemarra-regular">his father or his son specifically? Even </span>if the injured party were <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person, not a close relative of the owner of the property, the owner of the animal would be required to pay half a ransom, and even if it was in the public domain.
The Gemara answers: Indeed, that is the case, and the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>this ruling by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the typical scenario, </span>that presumably it was someone from the family of the one who owns the property containing the pit that was inside the pit.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he brought </span>the ox into the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the courtyard is liable </span>for the damage caused. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: The homeowner is not liable in any of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought onto his premises, unless he explicitly accepts responsibility upon himself to safeguard them. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that the Sages disagreed with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Shmuel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a case similar to that of the mishna: If the owner of the courtyard said to the owner of the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring your ox into </span>my courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and safeguard it, </span>then if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage</span> to the property of the owner of the courtyard, the animal’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>And if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured,</span> the owner of the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>If he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring your ox in and I will safeguard it, </span>then if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured, </span>the owner of the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult: You said </span>in the first clause that if the courtyard’s owner said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring your ox into </span>my courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and safeguard it, </span>then if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>And if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured, </span>the owner of the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason that the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable and the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">Safeguard it. </span>One can infer that if he granted permission for the ox to enter <span class="gemarra-regular">without specifying </span>that the owner of the animal safeguard it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>if the ox was injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>if it caused damage. The reason the owner of the courtyard is liable is that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that in an unspecified </span>case, where the obligation to safeguard the animal was not mentioned, the owner of the courtyard implicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the ox.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause: </span>If he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring your ox in and I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">safeguard it, </span>then if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured, </span>the owner of the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>if the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>its owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason that the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I will safeguard it. </span>One can infer that if the owner of the courtyard granted permission for the ox to enter <span class="gemarra-regular">without specifying </span>that the owner of the animal safeguard it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>if it damages the property of the owner of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of the courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>if the ox is damaged. The reason the owner of the courtyard is not liable is that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that in an unspecified </span>case, where the obligation to safeguard the animal was not mentioned, the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept upon himself </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>the ox.
The Gemara concludes its analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">We come to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the homeowner </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding, </span>he is not liable. Based on this understanding, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>Indeed, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">disjointed, </span>and the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who taught this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach that </span>clause. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The entire </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>and no inference should be drawn from the extra words: And I will safeguard it, in the latter clause. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the first clause mentions </span>that the owner of the courtyard instructed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Safeguard it, the latter clause also teaches </span>that he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I will safeguard it, </span>to maintain symmetry. The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies even when granting permission to enter without specification, since, according to the Rabbis, granting permission to enter includes an implicit acceptance of responsibility for safeguarding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: The entire </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that if no specification was made, the owner of the courtyard does not accept responsibility, as inferred from the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the inference drawn from the first clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, who says: </span>For damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span>that is carried out by an innocuous ox <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of the injured </span>party, the ox’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>if the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">Safeguard it, </span>he is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">not transferring </span>the rights to any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion of the courtyard to him, </span>as evident from the fact that the owner of the ox must safeguard it and may not treat the courtyard as if it were his own. Consequently, if the ox gored, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case of damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the courtyard of the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one responsible for damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring in the courtyard of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full </span>cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
By contrast, if the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to </span>the owner of the ox: <span class="gemarra-regular">Safeguard it, </span>then by granting him permission to bring the ox onto his courtyard, he effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">transfers </span>rights to <span class="gemarra-regular">an area within the courtyard. </span>Therefore, with regard to damages, it becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard of partners, and </span>the one responsible for damage categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard of partners pays only half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that was intending to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">but struck </span>a pregnant <span class="gemarra-regular">woman, and her offspring, </span>i.e., the fetuses, <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>due to miscarriage, the owner of the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who was intending to </span>injure <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but struck</span> a pregnant <span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">and her offspring emerged </span>due to miscarriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How does he pay compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., how is their value assessed? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman </span>by calculating <span class="gemarra-regular">how much she </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">worth </span>if sold as a maidservant <span class="gemarra-regular">before giving birth, and how much she </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">worth after giving birth. </span>He then pays the difference in value to the woman’s husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: </span>

Daf 49a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the consequences would be absurd, as <span class="gemarra-regular">when a woman gives birth </span>her value <span class="gemarra-regular">increases. Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises how much the offspring are worth, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the one liable for the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>that amount <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband. And if she does not have a husband, </span>e.g., her husband died, he <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to his heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If the pregnant woman <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she was emancipated, or a convert, </span>and she was married to an emancipated Canaanite slave or to a convert who died without any heirs, the one who caused the damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from pay-ing compensation for miscarried offspring. This is because this payment is made specifically to the husband, not to the woman.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The first clause of the mishna indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the owner is exempt from paying compensation for the offspring when an ox unintentionally gores a pregnant woman is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was intending to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span> ox. By inference, if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was intending to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman,</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring. Shall we say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">should be a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Adda bar Ahava,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rav Adda bar Ahava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen that intended to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>and then did so, the owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring?</span>
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava</span> could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The same is true, that even </span>if the oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman, </span>the owners are <span class="gemarra-regular">also exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring. </span>As for <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was intending to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>ox, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>taught this way <span class="gemarra-regular">since it wants to teach the latter clause: A person that was intending to </span>injure <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">as this </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>explicitly in <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse: </span>“And if men struggle and hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). In the case in the verse, the assailant intended to injure another person but injured the woman instead. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">also teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>in that style: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox that was intending to </span>gore <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that gored </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and her offspring emerged </span>due to miscarriage, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring. What is the reason? </span>The ox <span class="gemarra-regular">injured a mere pregnant donkey. </span>With regard to the matter of compensation for offspring, who would be the property of the master were they to be born, a Canaanite slave is considered property of the master. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states </span>that Abraham addressed Eliezer, who was a Canaanite, by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You remain here with [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the donkey” </span>(Genesis 22:5), on which the Sages expound that he was alluding to the idea that Eliezer is of <span class="gemarra-regular">a people [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that is similar to a donkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the case of an ox goring a Canaanite maidservant is not included in the Torah’s exemption from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does he pay compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring? </span>The court appraises how much the value of the woman increased due to the offspring. The Gemara asks: Would this be a correct interpretation of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring? </span>If this is how the sum is calculated, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated: How does he pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the increase </span>in value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: How does he pay compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the increase </span>in value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring? </span>In other words, apart from evaluating the compensation for the miscarried offspring, the court also appraises the value of the woman before giving birth and her value after giving birth.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If so, </span>the consequences would be absurd, as <span class="gemarra-regular">when a woman gives birth </span>her value <span class="gemarra-regular">increases.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? Rabba said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: But is </span>the monetary value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman higher before she gives birth than after she gives birth? But isn’t</span> the opposite true, that the monetary value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">higher after giving birt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than before giving birth, </span>since the concern for her dying during childbirth, which lowers her monetary value prior to giving birth, is no longer a concern? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the fetuse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gives </span>that amount <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This</span> explanation of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span>the monetary value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman higher before she gives birth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than after she gives birth? But isn’t </span>the opposite true, that the monetary value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">higher after giving birth than before giving birth? Rather,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the fetuses and gives </span>that amount <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This is what </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: But is </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman higher </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for the one for whom she gives birth, </span>i.e., her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she herself does not have any increase </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span> due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring? </span>A pregnant woman’s monetary value is increased on account of her pregnancy, beyond the monetary value of the offspring. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring and gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>husband and wife <span class="gemarra-regular">divide the increase </span>in her value due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explanation of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: But is </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman higher </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for the one for whom she gives birth, </span>i.e., her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she herself does not have any increase </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span> due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring? Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises damage by itself and pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by itself, and appraises </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband, and the </span>husband and wife <span class="gemarra-regular">divide the increase </span>in her value due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring.</span>
The Gemara asks: The opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that the woman’s value decreases because of pregnancy, poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for that of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that it increases.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>since each <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a different case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which stated that the woman’s value increases after giving birth, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">giving birth to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Her value decreases prior to birth out of concern that she might die in childbirth. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which stated that her value increases due to pregnancy, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who is not giving birth to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: The increase </span>in her value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband? </span>The Gemara answers: They derive it from a redundancy in a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “And hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">From the fact that it is stated: “And her offspring emerge,” don’t I know </span>by inference <span class="gemarra-regular">that she was pregnant? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “A pregnant </span>woman,” and not just “a woman”? <span class="gemarra-regular">To inform you </span>that even the <span class="gemarra-regular">increase </span>in her value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the pregnancy </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel expound on this </span>extra word <span class="gemarra-regular">“pregnant”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires it for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says </span>that one who injures a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is never liable </span>to pay compensation for miscarried offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he strikes her opposite the womb, </span>i.e., on the abdomen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Do not say</span> that it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">literally opposite the womb. Rather, </span>he is liable if she was struck <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that the wound’s </span>impact could <span class="gemarra-regular">reach the offspring, </span>i.e., any part of the torso, <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude</span> a wound to her <span class="gemarra-regular">hand or foot, for which </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> liable, since it could be argued that it was not the wound to the hand or foot that caused the miscarriage.
§ The mishna teaches: If the pregnant woman <span class="gemarra-regular">was a maidservant and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she was emancipated, or a convert, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the payment of damages for miscarried offspring. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one injured her during the lifetime of the convert, </span>i.e., her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the convert died </span>before the payment was given. The reason for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that since </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">injured her during the lifetime of the convert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the convert acquires </span>the money, although it is still in the possession of the one liable for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And once the convert dies </span>without heirs, the money is ownerless. Therefore, the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires it from the convert. </span>Since anyone can assume ownership of ownerless property, the assailant, who already possesses the money, becomes the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he injured her after the convert had died, she acquires </span>the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he must pay the woman herself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>in amazement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of this ruling! Is that to say</span> that compensation for the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>of money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she acquires them </span>when her husband dies? Rabba seems to understand that the pregnant woman assumes ownership of the offspring by virtue of being in possession of them when the husband dies, and therefore has the right to compensation for them. That is not the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband is present, the Merciful One grants</span> compensation for the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband is not </span>alive, the Torah does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>grant compensation to anyone else.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against the opinion of Rabba from the following: If the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">struck the woman and her offspring emerged </span>due to miscarriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage and pain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the woman and compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring to the husband. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband is not </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>the compensation for the offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">to his heirs. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman is not </span>alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>the payment owed to her <span class="gemarra-regular">to her heirs. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she was a maidservant and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she was emancipated, or a convert, </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the money. This indicates that if the husband is no longer alive, the woman doesn’t receive anything.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response to this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable to the mishna, which we interpreted </span>as a referring to case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he injured her during the lifetime of the convert, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the convert </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died? Here also, </span>it must be explained <span class="gemarra-regular">that he injured her during the lifetime of the convert, and the convert</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">died. And if you wish, say </span>instead that he injured her even <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death of the convert. </span>

Daf 49b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the expression in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: He acquires, referring to the one who causes the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: She acquires.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute between Rabba and Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">is parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish woman who was married to a convert, and she became pregnant from him, and </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">injured her, </span>causing her to miscarry: If this was <span class="gemarra-regular">during the lifetime of the convert, </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">gives compensation for</span> miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring to the convert, </span>i.e., her husband. If this was <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death of the convert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the assailant is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the assailant is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What, is it not </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly</span> a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>His opinion does not accord with the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, shall we say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
This is not necessarily so, as Rav Ḥisda could say that both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are in accordance with his opinion. As for the difference between them, that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>They can be explained as referring to the increase in the woman’s value due to the offspring, which is subject to dispute in the mishna, rather than referring to the payment of compensation for miscarried offspring. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which taught that he is exempt, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who maintain that the increase in her value on account of the offspring belongs to the husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which taught that he is liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</span> who maintains that the woman has a share in her increase in value due to pregnancy, and this is paid even if the incident occurred after the husband’s death.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, why </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>that it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death</span> of the husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even during </span>the husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she also has a half </span>share, as explained earlier in the discussion. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">While </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, she has a half </span>share, but <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">death, all of it</span> belongs to her.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>but they refer to different payments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that taught that he is liable, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the increase </span>in her value due to the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring, </span>which belongs partly to the woman, and if the husband dies, she acquires the rights to all of it. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that taught that he is exempt, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring, </span>which belongs exclusively to her husband. Since he is a convert, the one liable for damage is exempt after his death.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>in questioning this answer: Why is there a difference between the two cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that after the husband’s death the woman acquires his share of the <span class="gemarra-regular">increase </span>in her value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring, let </span>it be <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>that according to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel she also acquires the rights to the <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring </span>if she was wounded after his death. Moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, let </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that this is also the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>since there is no dispute between them with regard to the payment of compensation for miscarried offspring.
In response, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: No, </span>the first assumption is untenable, since with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">increase </span>in her value due to <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring, in which she has a share </span>from the outset, <span class="gemarra-regular">she acquires all of it </span>after her husband’s death. By contrast, with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring, in which she does not have a share </span>from the outset, <span class="gemarra-regular">she does not acquire </span>the rights <span class="gemarra-regular">to it at all, </span>since she has no greater claim to this than any other individual does.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeiva the Elder raises a dilemma to Rav Naḥman: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes possession of the documents of a convert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> after the death of the convert? On the one hand, it can be argued that one <span class="gemarra-regular">who takes possession of the document takes possession with the intention </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>acquiring <span class="gemarra-regular">the land </span>that the document states is under lien, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not take possession of the land </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he also does not acquire the document. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he had no intention </span>to acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the document, </span>but just the property specified in the document. Therefore, since the convert has died, perhaps the lien is canceled and can no longer be collected, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps his intention is also to </span>acquire <span class="gemarra-regular">the document, </span>and the paper on which it is written belongs to him.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Answer </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">my Master: Does he need </span>to acquire the document to use as paper <span class="gemarra-regular">to cover the opening of his flask</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why would he want the document if it does not grant him ownership of the land described therein? Rav Yeiva the Elder <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Indeed, his intention is even <span class="gemarra-regular">to cover </span>the flask <span class="gemarra-regular">and to cover </span>it with the paper, albeit a mundane purpose.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>In a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">collateral of a Jew </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of a conver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> who lent him money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the convert died, and another Jew came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and took possession of it, </span>then, since the convert has no heirs, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriates it from his possession </span>and returns it to its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? Since the convert died,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his lien </span>on the property <span class="gemarra-regular">is abrogated. </span>Therefore, the deposit automatically returns to its owner, and no one else has the right to take it.
By contrast, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">collateral of a conver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of a Jew </span>who lent him money <span class="gemarra-regular">and the convert died, and another Jew came and took possession of it, this </span>one, i.e., the one owed money, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>a share of the collateral <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the money </span>owed <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>by the convert, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, i.e., the one who took possession of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires the rest.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>doesn’t the creditor acquire the entire collateral? If it is in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">let his courtyard effect acquisition for him, as doesn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina say: A person’s courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisition for him </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without his knowledge?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span> standing next to the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Anywhere that he is </span>present, next to the collateral, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wants to acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could </span>pick it up and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">his courtyard also effects acquisition for him. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that he is not </span>present, next to the collateral, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that if he wants to acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he could not acquire </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his courtyard also does not effect acquisition </span>for him.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>where the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">in his courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not acquire </span>the rest of the collateral.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who digs </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on private </span><span class="gemarra-regular">propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>digs a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property, </span>or digs a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property and opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">on another </span>person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">private </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused by the pit in each case.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who digs a pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on private property and opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, or </span>who digs a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and this is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit that is stated in the Torah; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">renounced ownership of his property but did not renounce ownership of his pit </span>located in the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit that is stated in the Torah.</span>
In explanation of this dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: With regard to a pit</span> that a person digs or opens <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain, everyone agrees that he is liable </span>for damage that occurs as a result. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? The verse states: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall open </span>a pit,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall dig </span>a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for opening</span> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>obvious that he should be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for digging </span>a new pit? What, then, does the latter phrase add? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the interpretation of the verse must be that the responsibility for the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to him by engaging in opening </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and by engaging in digging </span>the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree only</span>

Daf 50a

in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one dug <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and then renounced ownership of the surrounding area. Consequently, the entire area except for the pit is now open to public passage. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva maintains </span>that one who digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also liable, </span>not only when the pit is located in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the pit </span>shall pay” (Exodus 21:34). Clearly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is referring to a pit that has an owner. </span>Therefore, the owner of the pit pays even if it is located on private property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael maintains </span>that “the owner of the pit” means that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one responsible for the hazard </span>is liable even if he dug the pit in the public domain and then renounced ownership of it. But one who digs a pit on his own property is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>according to Rabba’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is meant by the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit that is stated in the Torah, </span>in reference to digging a pit on one’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Akiva states? </span>According to him, one is liable for damage in all cases, including digging in the public domain. The Gemara answers: It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the pit </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse initially introduces </span>the subject <span class="gemarra-regular">of compensation</span> for damage caused. In that context, the Torah states: “The owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:34), indicating that even a pit owned on one’s private property renders one liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said </span>that one can explain the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>one who dug <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit on </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">private property </span>and then renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he is liable. What is the reason? </span>Since <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states: “The owner of the pit,” </span>it indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with a pit that has an owner.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the pit</span> was dug <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. Rabbi Yishmael maintains </span>that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">also liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>dug <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, as it is written: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall open </span>a pit,” and: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall dig</span> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for opening </span>a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>obvious that he should be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for digging </span>a new pit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse means that the responsibility for the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to him by engaging in opening </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and by engaging in digging </span>the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva, </span>by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>phrases <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary, for if the Merciful One wrote </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall open </span>a pit” (Exodus 21:33), <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> specifically when <span class="gemarra-regular">one opens </span>the covering of a pit that has already been dug <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is sufficient for him to </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">a covering </span>on it to absolve himself of responsibility for damage it causes. This is the case where the Torah states: “And not cover it” (Exodus 21:33). But if one actually <span class="gemarra-regular">digs </span>a pit, it <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be sufficient </span>to place <span class="gemarra-regular">a covering </span>on it, and one would not be exempt from damages <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">packs it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the Merciful One had written </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall dig,” I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">digging that a covering is required </span>to exempt one from liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he performed an action </span>of creating the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for merely <span class="gemarra-regular">opening </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">where one has not performed an action, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require a covering </span>to absolve him of liability. Therefore, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he is liable for damage caused by a pit in both cases, and one should interpret the verse that states: “The owner of the pit” (Exodus 21:34), in its plain sense, i.e., that he is the owner of the pit because it is located on his private property. Accordingly, one would not be liable for a pit dug in the public domain.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>according to Rav Yosef’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is meant by the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit that is stated in the Torah, </span>in reference to digging a pit in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yishmael </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states? </span>Isn’t one liable for any pit, including one dug on his own property? The Gemara answers: It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the pit </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse initially introduces </span>the subject <span class="gemarra-regular">of damage </span>caused by Pit, as explained by Rabbi Yishmael above. Only afterward does it state: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” referring to a pit dug on one’s own property.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who digs a pit </span>whose hollow space is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">opens its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">into private property </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though he does not have permission to do so. </span>The reason he does not have permission to do so is <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not create a hollow </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">under the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who digs pits, ditches, and caves on private property and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">opens their </span>entrances <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>In addition, one <span class="gemarra-regular">who digs pits on private property</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is adjacent to the public domain </span>but not actually located in the public domain itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as these </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who dig foundations [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ushin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> for their houses or walls, is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even for damage caused by pits made to lay foundations, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he builds a partition </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high in front of the pits, <span class="gemarra-regular">or unless he distances </span>them by <span class="gemarra-regular">four handbreadths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the area where pedestrians walk and from the area where animals walk.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>for the exemption is that one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">foundations, </span>which is the usual and accepted practice, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>dig <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">foundations, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Although he did so on his own property, he is nevertheless liable, since people walk there.
The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rabba, the first clause, </span>where one is seemingly exempt for opening a pit onto private property even if he subsequently renounced ownership of the area, can be established in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, and the last clause </span>can be established in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who maintains that one is liable for a pit dug on his own property if it is open to public traffic.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rav Yosef’s</span> explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause, all agree </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>which exempts one who digs a pit on his own property, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this? </span>It appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael nor </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>since Rav Yosef explained that both of them maintain that one is liable for a pit on his own property, even if he subsequently renounces ownership of the area.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Everyone agrees </span>with the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>passage. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>which exempts one who digs a pit under the public domain and opens it onto his own property, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did not renounce ownership of either his property or his pit. </span>This certainly is not included in the category of Pit with regard to damages, and the owner is therefore exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Now that you have interpreted Rav Yosef’s </span>explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with all </span>opinions, then <span class="gemarra-regular">also according to Rabba, </span>you are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish it as </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rather, one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since the first clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span>who exempts one who renounces ownership of his property but not the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be explained in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael. And </span>it was previously inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the exemption when digging on one’s private property adjacent to the public domain is that one digs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>lay <span class="gemarra-regular">foundations. But </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not to </span>lay <span class="gemarra-regular">foundations, </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. For instance, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one widene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the pit unnecessarily, extending it <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain, </span>he has effectively dug a pit in the public domain itself.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">who digs a pit on private property and opens it into the public domain </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>But if he dug it <span class="gemarra-regular">on private property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was adjacent to the public domain, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Granted, according to Rabba, </span>this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span>who does not hold one liable for digging on his own property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to Rav Yosef, granted, the first clause </span>works out well in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span>who holds one liable even for digging in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause? </span>It appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael nor </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva.</span>
The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>The latter clause of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">digs to </span>lay <span class="gemarra-regular">foundations, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>with the ruling.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If someone <span class="gemarra-regular">dug or opened </span>a well <span class="gemarra-regular">and transferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the publi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> for their use, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from damage caused by the well. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he dug or opened </span>a well <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not transfer </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And this </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the practice of Neḥunya the digger of pits, ditches, and caves, who would dig, open, and transfer </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public </span>so that there would be wells of water for public use. <span class="gemarra-regular">When the Sages heard about the matter, they said: This </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">has fulfilled this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: Only <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and no more?</span> Isn’t it well known that Neḥunya was a great man? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: </span>He fulfilled <span class="gemarra-regular">even this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> and did not forget to transfer the wells to the public.
Having mentioned the deeds of Neḥunya, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving the daughter of Neḥunya the ditchdigger, where she fell into a large cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and no one could extricate her from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came and informed Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa </span>so that he would pray on her behalf. When <span class="gemarra-regular">the first hour </span>had passed from the time of her fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>She is at <span class="gemarra-regular">peace </span>and unharmed. After the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>She is at <span class="gemarra-regular">peace. </span>After the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: She has ascended </span>from the well, and indeed this was the case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to her: Who brought you up </span>out of the well? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to them: A male sheep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a ram, <span class="gemarra-regular">happened</span> to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, and a certain old man, </span>i.e., Abraham, <span class="gemarra-regular">was leading it, </span>and he pulled me out. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you a prophet? </span>How did you know she had ascended? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: “I am no prophet, neither am I a prophet’s son” </span>(Amos 7:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">but this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>to myself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall the offspring</span> of Neḥunya <span class="gemarra-regular">stumble by means of </span>the very <span class="gemarra-regular">matter which distressed that righteous man?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa says: </span>Although Neḥunya ensured that others would have water, <span class="gemarra-regular">even so, his son died of thirst, </span>fulfilling that which <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And around Him it storms [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nisara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] mightily” </span>(Psalms 50:3). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is scrupulous with those around Him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the righteous, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to the extent <span class="gemarra-regular">of a hairsbreadth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hasa’ara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>so that even minor transgressions elicit a severe punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥunya says: </span>The same idea may be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>in the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him” </span>(Psalms 89:8), indicating that God is most careful and exacting with those that surround Him, i.e., the righteous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: Anyone who states </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, is forgiving [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vateran</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of transgressions, <span class="gemarra-regular">his life will be relinquished </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yivatru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as it is stated: “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:4). In other words, God does not waive heavenly justice. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥana says, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani </span>says: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written</span>

Daf 50b

in the verse that recounts the thirteen attributes of mercy: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Long-suffering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">erekh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">appayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 34:6), using the plural form, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not written </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">erekh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">af</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the singular? In order to teach that He is <span class="gemarra-regular">long-suffering for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for the wicke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and does not punish them immediately for their transgressions.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: A person should not throw stones from his property into the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving a certain individual who was throwing stones from his property into the public domain, and a certain pious man found him. </span>The latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Lowlife [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">reika</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">are you throwing stones from property that is not yours into your property? </span>The man <span class="gemarra-regular">mocked him, </span>as he did not understand what he meant, as the property from which he was throwing stones was his.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some days </span>later, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was forced to sell his field </span>from which he had thrown the stones. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he was walking in the same public domain </span>into which he had thrown them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he stumbled on those same stones.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said: That pious man said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">well to me </span>when he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">are you throwing stones from property that is not yours into your own property, </span>since that property no longer belongs to me, and only the public domain remains mine to use.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs a pit in the public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span> The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the <span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs </span>either <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit; a ditch, </span>which is narrow and long; <span class="gemarra-regular">or a cave, </span>which is rectangular and roofed; <span class="gemarra-regular">trenches and </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">channels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In all these cases he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. If so, why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, </span>as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a pit that has sufficient</span> depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>when falling into it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, any </span>other excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">that have sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>may be no less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths. </span>If any of the types of excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">were less than ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fell into </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them and died, </span>the digger of the excavation is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But if it was injured in it, </span>not killed, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>Damage by <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit for which the Torah obligates one </span>to pay is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage caused by the pit’s lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., suffocation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not to </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of hitting the ground, for which the digger of the pit is exempt from paying compensation. The Gemara continues to explain: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it can be inferred that Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">impact </span>of hitting the bottom of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is merely the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that injures him. </span>The digger of the pit does not own the ground, so it is not a case where his property caused damage. Therefore, he does not bear responsibility for the damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>The Torah renders one liable for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by its </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, and all the more so for </span>damage resulting from <span class="gemarra-regular">the impact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Shmuel adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah spoke </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">its impact and not for its </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>one could respond that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah testifies about a pit </span>without specifying for which type of pit one is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this includes <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">full of woolen sponges [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefogin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which would completely absorb the impact.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rav and Shmuel, given that falling into any pit involves injury due to both the lethal fumes and the impact? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned a moun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with a height of ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain </span>without digging, and an animal fell from this raised platform and died. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rav, </span>the one who fashioned the mound <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable for </span>damage by Pit in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound, </span>since there are no fumes, as the animal fell to the level ground. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Shmuel, he is also liable for </span>damage by Pit in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since there is nevertheless an impact when hitting the ground.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source for <span class="gemarra-regular">the reasoning of Rav, </span>that one is not liable in that case? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the verse states:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And </span>an ox or a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>therein” (Exodus 21:33), indicating that there is no liability for damage by Pit <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">falls </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">normal manner of falling, </span>but not where it first climbed onto an elevated surface and then fell from there to the level ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Shmuel, </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span> an ox or a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">fall,” indicates any manner </span>of falling, regardless of whether the animal fell into a hole or fell to the ground from an elevated surface.
The Gemara challenges Rav’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why is </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, </span>as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a pit that has sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>when falling into it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, any </span>other excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">that have sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>may be no less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths. </span>Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted </span>that according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shmuel, </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, any </span>other, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the case where the animal fell from <span class="gemarra-regular">a height </span>of ten handbreadths, in which case the one who fashioned the mound would also be liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rav, </span>who exempts him in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>does the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, any </span>other, <span class="gemarra-regular">add?</span>
The Gemara answers: According to Rav, it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trenches and </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">channels. </span>The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">trenches and </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">channels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are explicitly taught </span>in the mishna. Why does the mishna then allude to them again? The Gemara answers: It first <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> about them <span class="gemarra-regular">and then explain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> its source in the Torah.
Having mentioned these details, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">that are taught </span>by the mishna? The Gemara answers: They are <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, for had </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>only the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, I would say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that contains </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, because it is constricted and round. </span>Therefore, this measurement suffices to cause death. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch, which is long,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna teaches both the case of a pit and a ditch.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch </span>in addition to the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that contains </span>the necessary lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because it is narrow. But </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave, which is rectangular </span>and not narrow, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna teaches the case of a cave as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">had</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave </span>in addition to the previous two, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that contains </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, because it is covered.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">trenches, which are not covered, say </span>that at a depth <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna also teaches the case of trenches.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">trenches </span>in addition to the previous three, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">trenches </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that contain </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, since they are no wider at the top than at the bottom. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to channels, which are wider at the top than at the bottom, say </span>that at a depth <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>the case of channels as well, and each subsequent case listed contains a novel aspect.
The Gemara raises a further challenge from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: If any of the types of excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">were less than ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fell into </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them and died, </span>the digger of the excavation is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. But if it was injured, </span>not killed, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the ruling of: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? Is it not because </span>at this height <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">impact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> although there are lethal fumes?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>he is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes. </span>The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that a pit less than ten handbreadths deep lacks sufficient lethal fumes, why is the one who dug it <span class="gemarra-regular">liable if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is injured; but there are no </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes? </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">answers: There are not </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes to </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">death, but there are </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes to </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain ox that fell into a water channel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la’arita</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">dedala’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> whose depth was one cubit, i.e., six handbreadths. Because it suffered the impact of the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">its owner </span>assumed it would die and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it </span>first, in order to eat the meat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who was concerned that its organs were crushed by the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed it an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which it is prohibited to consume.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: If the owner of this ox had taken a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of flour </span>to bake into bread to eat instead of slaughtering his animal for its meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and gone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and learned in the study hall </span>that although an ox that falls and hits the ground is considered <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> if slaughtered immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">remaine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> alive <span class="gemarra-regular">for twenty-four hour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and is then slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit to eat, he would not have lost </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that was worth several </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of flour. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, Rav Naḥman maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an impact</span> caused even <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>a pit that is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than ten </span>handbreadths, as Rav Naḥman was concerned in this case that its organs were crushed and it was fatally wounded.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>from the mishna: If any of the types of excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">were less than ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fell into </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not because there is no </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">impact </span>capable of causing death? If so, why is this animal deemed a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>? 

Daf 51a

Rav Naḥman responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>he is exempt here <span class="gemarra-regular">because there are not </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>to cause death, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. Nevertheless, the impact from hitting the ground is sufficient to cause death, and therefore an ox that fell into a water channel is suspected of being a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>. Rava again challenges him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then how is the statement: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured by it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>to be explained? <span class="gemarra-regular">There are not </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes? </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There are not </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes to </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">death, but there are </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes to </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">injury.</span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 45a): <span class="gemarra-regular">The structure </span>from which <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">stoning </span>was implemented <span class="gemarra-regular">was a height of two </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is taught in that regard </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the two-person height of the structure is combined with <span class="gemarra-regular">his height, </span>i.e., the height of the one being stoned, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a total height equal to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people. Rava explains his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an impact </span>capable of causing death <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">less than ten </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">all of this </span>height?
Rav Naḥman answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, let us make</span> the structure a minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths. Why must it have a height of two people? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>no proof can be brought from here, since the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself” </span>(Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <span class="gemarra-regular">select a good, </span>i.e., a compassionate, <span class="gemarra-regular">death for him. </span>Therefore, the structure used for stoning is constructed sufficiently high that he dies quickly, without any unnecessary suffering.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let us raise </span>the structure even <span class="gemarra-regular">more, </span>so that his death will be even less painful. The Gemara answers: This is not done, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>if he fell from a greater height, his organs would be crushed and he would become completely <span class="gemarra-regular">disfigured, </span>which is certainly not a way one would prefer to die.
Rava again <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rav Naḥman: The Torah requires constructing a parapet on the roof of one’s house to prevent anyone from falling to his death, as the verse states (Deuteronomy 22:8): “You shall not bring blood upon your house, <span class="gemarra-regular">if any man falls from it.” </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“from it” </span>teaches that liability exists only for falling from the roof of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not onto </span>the roof  of a house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">so? </span>If an area in the <span class="gemarra-regular">public domain was ten handbreadths higher than </span>a private house and the owner did not construct a fence between his house and the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from inside </span>the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">onto </span>the house, the owner of the house is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>By contrast, if the public domain was <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths lower than </span>the house, and the owner did not construct a fence on his roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from </span>the roof of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the public domain, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a sufficiently strong <span class="gemarra-regular">impact </span>to cause death even at a height <span class="gemarra-regular">of less than ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the roof to be <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high for there to be a requirement to construct a parapet? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the parapet for the roof of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different, since any </span>structure <span class="gemarra-regular">less than ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>and only a house requires a parapet.
Rava objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>i.e., if the requirement to build a parapet is limited to a house that is ten handbreadths high, then <span class="gemarra-regular">also now, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">is ten </span>handbreadths higher than the public domain when measured <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside, remove </span>the height of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ceiling and the plaster, </span>which is an additional layer on top of the ceiling. When measured <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside </span>in this manner, its height <span class="gemarra-regular">is not ten. </span>According to you, then, it is not classified as a house. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he hollowed out </span>an extra space <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>in the floor of the house so that its height would be ten handbreadths.
Rava challenges him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">is not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside as well, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>a scenario <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such as where he hollowed out extra </span>space <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the floor, thereby transforming it into a house with the required height. Why, then, would a person be exempt in this case?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the previous explanation must be entirely rejected, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reasoning of Rav Naḥman </span>when he ruled that one must suspect that the ox’s organs were crushed upon falling into the water channel. He <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>the following argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">from the stomach of the o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the ground? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>deep <span class="gemarra-regular">is the water channel? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>totals <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">transpires that when </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">hits </span>the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is from </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that it hits </span>the ground, since it landed on its stomach and not on its feet.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, which teaches: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a pit that has sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>when falling into it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, any </span>other excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">that have sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>may be no less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>deep, why not say that a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">with six </span>handbreadths would <span class="gemarra-regular">also be sufficient?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled into the pit, </span>in which case the pit would be required to have a depth of ten handbreadths. By contrast, if it fell while walking, the extra height from the ground to its stomach is included in calculating the ten handbreadths.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit belonging to two partners </span>was uncovered and <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">passed by it and did not cover it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>passed by it <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not cover it, the second </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for any damage caused by means of the pit.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: How can you find </span>such a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit belonging to two partners? This works out well if we hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says </span>that one who digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>on his own property and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage. According to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the courtyard belongs to both of them and the pit belongs to both of them, and they renounced ownership of their property but did not renounce ownership of their pit. </span>In that case, both are responsible for any damage caused.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if we hold </span>that one who digs <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability for damage caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find </span>a case of a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>It can only be a case where it is located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, and how can you find </span>a case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">pit belonging to two partners in the public domain?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If they both </span>jointly <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed an agent and said to him: Go dig </span>a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">for us, and he went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">dug </span>a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>both of <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>then neither is liable. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no agency for transgression, </span>and the digger is solely responsible. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if this </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">dug </span>a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>partner dug <span class="gemarra-regular">five</span> further handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>significance of the initial <span class="gemarra-regular">act of </span>digging performed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">has been removed. </span>Now all responsibility rests with the second partner, who deepened the pit to ten handbreadths, which is the minimum depth for which one is liable for an animal’s death. Therefore, this is also not treated as a jointly owned pit.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you find in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>that both would be liable, as the Gemara will soon explain. Therefore, it qualifies as a case of a pit belonging to two partners. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, the first partner is not held liable at all in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pit causes an animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death; and according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>the first partner is not held liable both in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where it causes death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>in a situation where it merely causes <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how, can you find </span>an instance of a pit belonging to partners?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they both extracted a chunk </span>of earth from the bottom of the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">completed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths. This, then, would constitute a pit belonging to both of them.
Having mentioned the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis, the Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs a pit nine</span> handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and completed </span>the digging <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span>individual alone is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for an injury or death caused by the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the latter </span>for restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for death </span>caused by the pit. The latter is solely liable, since only a pit of ten handbreadths renders a person liable for an animal’s death. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows both of them </span>for restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>caused by the pit.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis? As the verse states: “If </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall open </span>a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall dig </span>a pit” (Exodus 21:33), it raises the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for opening </span>a covered pit that has already been dug, then is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>that he should be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for digging </span>a new pit? What, then, does that latter phrase add? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the case of one person who begins to <span class="gemarra-regular">dig </span>a pit and <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>he does so, a second person continues to <span class="gemarra-regular">dig. </span>By subsequently stating: “If a man shall dig a pit,” the Torah teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a new pit is effectively created by the second digger, whose digging <span class="gemarra-regular">removed, </span>i.e., rendered irrelevant, <span class="gemarra-regular">the action of the first </span>digger and who bears full responsibility for the pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: These </span>two clauses in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>and the second clause cannot serve to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the sole liability of the second digger. The reason they are necessary is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we said</span> earlier (50a), where interpretations were cited according to both Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis also </span>agree that they <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary </span>for those interpretations? If so, what is the source of their opinion that responsibility for the pit rests solely with the second partner?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the previous explanation must be rejected, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reason of the Rabbis: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “If a man shall dig a pit,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not two. </span>Therefore, if two people jointly created the pit, the second bears responsibility and not the first.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi understand the phrase “if a man shall dig a pit”? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires that </span>phrase to teach another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“if a man shall dig a pit” </span>indicates that a person who digs a pit is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable if his <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>digs a <span class="gemarra-regular">pit.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>from where do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers that the combination of words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Man </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">pit, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">written twice: </span>“If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit.” From one phrase, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived that a person must do the digging, and not an animal. From the second phrase, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived that one person bears responsibility for the damage, and not two people.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi derive from this repetition? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote this </span>first clause using this wording, it similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote this </span>second clause in the same fashion. The repetition is for stylistic reasons, and is not meant to teach a new <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara continues to ask about the opinion of the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even if they derive from the verse that only one person is liable for damage caused through the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do they know <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Torah intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to render </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter one liable </span>for the damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to render the first one </span>who started the digging <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the damage.
The Gemara answers: It should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind </span>to suggest this, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him” </span>(Exodus 21:34). This indicates that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who causes the death, </span>i.e., the second one, who is liable, and not the first. This is because it is the second one who completed digging the necessary depth for causing death, and not the first.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava </span>states? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit, </span>the pit’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.” </span>Evidently, the verse is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the carcass belongs </span>to him. This ox, which was consecrated and subsequently disqualified, does not fully belong to anybody, since its use is restricted. Since this verse serves to teach Rava’s ruling, it cannot serve to teach about the liability of the second digger.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">And can’t you learn from </span>the words and emphasis of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself that we are dealing with the one who caused </span>the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>even if these words are also used to derive Rava’s ruling? Therefore, the verse can serve as a source for both rulings.
On a similar subject, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs a pit </span>to a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another comes and completes </span>the depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to twenty </span>handbreadths by digging an additional ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another comes and completes it to thirty, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">all liable </span>for any damage caused by this pit. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a contradiction</span> against this from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who digs a pit </span>to a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and plastered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and cemented [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vekhiyyeid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage, and not the first. 

Daf 51b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that they are all liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds both liable for digging, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which holds the latter liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold only the last one liable?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>The way the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> accords with their opinion is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last one</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable only where the first </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">did not make the </span>pit of sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">measurement </span>to cause <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>but dug less than ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">But where the first one made </span>a pit of sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">measurement </span>to cause <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>such as in this case, where the first one dug ten handbreadths himself and it was subsequently deepened further by others, <span class="gemarra-regular">even the Rabbis concede that they are all liable.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where <span class="gemarra-regular">he plastered and cemented </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first made </span>a pit of sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">measurement </span>to cause <span class="gemarra-regular">death, and </span>nevertheless, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. They said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have fumes </span>capable of leading <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>since it was very wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the other came, and</span> by narrowing it with plaster and cementing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">added to it </span>the characteristic of having <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>capable of leading <span class="gemarra-regular">to death.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are</span> those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that this is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches: They are all liable, </span>fits <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches: The last one </span>alone is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have</span> sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes in it </span>that were capable of leading to <span class="gemarra-regular">either death or damage, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and </span>by narrowing it with plaster and cementing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he added to it </span>the characteristic of having <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>capable of leading <span class="gemarra-regular">to both death and damage.</span>
Elaborating on this subject, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a stone at the opening of a pit </span>less than ten handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">and brings </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths by raising the ground next to the opening of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis </span>concerning whether only the second or both are responsible for damage caused.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>This is precisely the case they are disputing, so what does Rava’s statement add to this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that there is a distinction between a person deepening a pit <span class="gemarra-regular">at the bottom, </span>in which case it <span class="gemarra-regular">is his </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes</span> that he caused <span class="gemarra-regular">that kill </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he added to the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">at the top, where it is not his </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">kill </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable. Rava’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the last one is liable, and this case is subject to dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis as to whether only the last one or both are liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If someone dug another handbreadth in a pit that was nine handbreadths deep, so that it reached a depth of ten handbreadths, and subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">closed up </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth </span>inside the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he removed his stones </span>that he had placed at the opening of the pit so that the depth of the pit was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say that what he did </span>to increase the depth of the pit to ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>removed, and restored the initial situation that existed before he dug the extra handbreadth, causing responsibility for damage to revert solely to the original digger?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>by closing it up, he <span class="gemarra-regular">removed the action of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>digger, since he has removed the ability of the pit to cause death? If so, it <span class="gemarra-regular">moves entirely into his possession </span>and he now assumes full responsibility for the pit of nine handbreadths. The Gemara concludes: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Marta says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>handbreadths deep and <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths of it </span>contain <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? Each handbreadth of water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is like two </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of dry space. </span>Therefore, the pit is effectively ten handbreadths in depth and contains a sufficient quantity of lethal fumes to render its owner liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and from that </span>measurement, <span class="gemarra-regular">one handbreadth </span>contains <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this case equivalent to the previous one? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>a quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>as in the case stated by Rabba bar bar Ḥana, the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>a sufficient quantity of lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>to render the digger liable? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it can be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">deeper </span>than the one in the previous case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does have </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>despite containing less water?
Similarly, the following question can be raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">and three of the handbreadths </span>contain <span class="gemarra-regular">water? Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">much larger </span>quantity <span class="gemarra-regular">of water </span>in this case, it is equivalent to a pit of ten handbreadths and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, or perhaps since it is not </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">deep, it does not have </span>a sufficient quantity of lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes</span> to render the digger liable? The Gemara concludes: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizevi asked </span>the following question <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba:</span> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">widened </span>the opening of a pit that was already ten handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>By doing so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>and has not worsened the situation. Therefore, he should not be liable. Rav Sheizevi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> On the contrary, </span>by widening the opening of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has brought the </span>potential for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage closer </span>to an animal that might fall inside.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said </span>concerning this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us see: If </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because of the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>the one who widened the pit should be exempt, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he reduced the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">died because of the impact, </span>he should be liable, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he has brought the </span>potential for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage closer </span>to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Let us see: If </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on that side </span>that he widened, then his action <span class="gemarra-regular">has brought the </span>potential for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage closer, </span>and so he should be liable. But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on the other side, </span>he should bear no responsibility, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he reduced the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit whose depth is equal to its width, Rabba and Rav Yosef both say </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who says </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Mani, </span>but each present it differently. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>A pit <span class="gemarra-regular">always contains </span>a quantity of lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes</span> sufficient for liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless its width is greater than its depth. </span>Therefore, when they are equal, the digger is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one says: </span>A pit <span class="gemarra-regular">never contains </span>a quantity of lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes </span>sufficient for liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless its depth is greater than its width. </span>Consequently, when they are equal, the digger is exempt.
§ The mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>partner <span class="gemarra-regular">passed by </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not cover it, </span>and then the second also passed by it and did not cover it, the second is liable. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from what point is the first exempt </span>from responsibility for the pit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef both say </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who says </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Mani, </span>but each one presents it differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">One says:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">he leaves </span>the other partner <span class="gemarra-regular">using it, and one says: </span>The first is absolved of responsibility only <span class="gemarra-regular">when he conveys to him his bucket, </span>with which he will draw water from the pit.
The Gemara notes: This dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who draws water from a cistern, and his friend comes and says to him: Leave me and I will draw water, once </span>the first person <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves </span>the second person while the second is <span class="gemarra-regular">using </span>the cistern, the first is now <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>if he did not cover it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>The first person is not absolved of responsibility until the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he conveys his bucket to </span>the second person.
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a legal concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">designation. </span>According to this principle, a situation in which certain aspects were not initially clearly defined can become clarified retroactively after a certain action or event occurs. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> treats all the aspects as being clearly defined and identifiable from the outset.
In this case, the water is considered divided between the partners even before they draw it. When they do draw it, it is treated as if <span class="gemarra-regular">this one were filling from his </span>part, the location of which has now been determined retroactively, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this one were filling from his </span>part. Therefore, as long as the first partner has not conveyed his bucket to the second, he, as an owner of a defined part of the water, has not absolved himself of responsibility for the cistern. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no designation </span>and they both have the right to draw water from the cistern. Therefore, as soon as the second partner is left alone to draw water, he is responsible for the cistern and all the water it contains, even without conveying the bucket.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: And </span>in this regard, they <span class="gemarra-regular">follow </span>their lines of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>in an analogous case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 45b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that vowed </span>not to derive any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from each other, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for them to enter </span>their jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>as this would violate their vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>It is permitted for them to enter the courtyard, since <span class="gemarra-regular">this one enters into his </span>portion of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one enters into his </span>portion.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and retroactively the section of the courtyard that each one enters becomes the portion that belongs to him. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one enters his </span>part, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one enters his </span>part. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no</span> retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and each portion of the courtyard belongs jointly to both.
§ Having mentioned this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning conveying a bucket to transfer responsibility for the pit, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a cistern to another,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">conveys his bucket to </span>the buyer for drawing water from the cistern, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the cistern. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>How does conveying the bucket serve to effect acquisition of the cistern? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is acquiring the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of paying <span class="gemarra-regular">money, let him acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money </span>that he paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is acquiring the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by taking possession, </span>which is accomplished by using it.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cistern was acquired through <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession, and </span>in that case, the seller usually <span class="gemarra-regular">must say to him: Go, take possession, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it for yourself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he conveys his bucket to him, he is like one who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Go, take possession, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it. Therefore, once he begins drawing water from the cistern, he has acquired it through taking possession.
The Gemara cites a related ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sells a house to another, </span>

Daf 52a

<span class="gemarra-regular">once he has conveyed the key to him, he has acquired </span>it.
Here too, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>involving this sale? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it was a transaction <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">money. If </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">by taking possession </span>of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by taking possession. </span>What is the significance of transferring the key? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the transaction occurred by <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession, and </span>in that case, the seller usually <span class="gemarra-regular">must say to him: Go, take possession, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it for yourself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he conveys the key to him, </span>he is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who says to him: Go, take possession, and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a flock </span>of sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, once he conveys the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashkukhit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>the flock.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the transaction occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling </span>the flock into his possession, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling. If </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">by conveying </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">conveying </span>it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it was a transaction <span class="gemarra-regular">by pulling, and </span>in that case, the seller usually <span class="gemarra-regular">must say to him: Go, pull </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and acquire </span>it for yourself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he conveys the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashkukhit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who says to him: Go, pull </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and acquire </span>it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is this <span class="gemarra-italic">mashkukhit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Here, </span>in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">they translate </span>it as <span class="gemarra-regular">a bell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karkashta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>that the shepherd rings and whose sound the flock follows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says: </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat that goes at the front </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the flock </span>that they follow. The Gemara notes: This explanation of Rabbi Ya’akov is similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which a certain Galilean taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of Rav Ḥisda concerning </span>this goat: <span class="gemarra-regular">When a shepherd is angry with his flock, he renders </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">leading [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lenaggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>them, i.e., the <span class="it-text">mashkukhit</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">blind. </span>Similarly, when God is angry with the Jewish people, he appoints unsuitable leaders for them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists several <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that pertain to damage classified as Pit: In the case of a pit that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>person who passed by <span class="gemarra-regular">covered </span>after using <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the second came </span>to use it <span class="gemarra-regular">and found it uncovered </span>after the cover fell off or was damaged, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover it, the second </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused by the pit. If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
If a man was digging or widening a pit, and an ox passing by <span class="gemarra-regular">fell forward </span>into it in fright <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sound </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the digging, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">backward </span>into the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sound</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the digging, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and its accoutrements, </span>i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">were broken, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey and its accoutrements </span>fell in <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the accoutrements <span class="gemarra-regular">were torn, </span>the owner of the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">the animal </span>caused by the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessels, </span>by Torah edict.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that was impaired by being <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf, </span>or an ox that was <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, or </span>an ox that was very <span class="gemarra-regular">young fell into </span>the pit, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a boy or a girl, </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave or </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant </span>fell in, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since there is a Torah edict that the digger of a pit is liable only for damage caused to an animal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the first case in the mishna, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And until when </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> if the pit is later uncovered? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>He is exempt from liability for the time necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">aware </span>that it became uncovered. Once this time has passed, he bears responsibility. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>He is exempt for the time necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>realize that the pit is uncovered and <span class="gemarra-regular">inform him. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>He is exempt for the time necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> others <span class="gemarra-regular">to inform him </span>that the cover has fallen down <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for him to <span class="gemarra-regular">hire workers and cut cedar trees </span>to make a suitable cover <span class="gemarra-regular">and cover it. </span>After this period of time has passed, the first bears responsibility.
§ The mishna teaches: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell inside and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately, how </span>did it <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>in? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says: </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside, </span>and he could not have known that the cover was damaged. Therefore, he is not responsible for damage caused as a result.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">covered it </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a cover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">able to withstand </span>the weight of <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen but cannot withstand</span> the weight of <span class="gemarra-regular">camels, </span>which are heavier, <span class="gemarra-regular">and camels came and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">weakened it, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen came </span>and broke the weakened cover <span class="gemarra-regular">and fell into </span>the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumstances? If camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is negligent, </span>since he should have constructed the cover suitably for camels as well. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if camels are not </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</span> if by chance they did come and weaken the cover.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>camels <span class="gemarra-regular">come occasionally, </span>in which case the question effectively becomes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since they come occasionally, he is</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, since he should have anticipated </span>their coming? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps since now, in any event, there are no </span>camels, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a possible proof from the mishna: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Now <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances? If we say </span>that he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and appropriately for camels, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>did they <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>in? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>the case that he covered it with a covering that was <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate for oxen</span>

Daf 52b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but not appropriate for camels? </span>In this case, the following must be clarified: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a location <span class="gemarra-regular">where camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found, why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? He is negligent. And if camels are not </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that he is exempt, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not </span>the case that this is a location <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>camels <span class="gemarra-regular">come occasionally, and camels came and weakened </span>the covering, after which <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen came and fell into it?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>with regard to this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Apparently, since now, </span>in any event, the camels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>there, he is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">actually, </span>the scenario is where he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen and appropriately for camels, and as for </span>what was <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult for you </span>to explain: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did they fall? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside, </span>and so nothing can be derived from here with regard to the question posed above with regard to the camels.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof from the mishna: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately, and an ox or a donkey fell in and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances? If we say </span>that he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cover it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen and </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cover it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for camels, </span>and they fell in, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious. </span>Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">need to be said that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>in that case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case where he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen but not appropriately for camels? </span>And if this is the case, the following point must be clarified: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If camels are</span> commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, but if camels are not </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>camels <span class="gemarra-regular">come occasionally, and camels came and weakened it, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen came and fell into it? And </span>in this case, it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Apparently, since they </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">come occasionally, he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, since he should have anticipated </span>that they would come.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is possible that he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriately for camels, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And as for </span>what was <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult for you </span>to explain: In such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent </span>and should be liable, rendering the ruling in the mishna superfluous, one may answer that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> needs to <span class="gemarra-regular">cite the first clause </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he <span class="gemarra-regular">covered it appropriately, he cites the latter clause as well, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that if he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover it appropriately, he is liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are</span> those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the discussion is as follows: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this also we certainly did not raise the dilemma, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">since they occasionally come, he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, as he should have anticipated </span>this possibility.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When we raised the dilemma, this is the dilemma that we raised: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">covered it </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a cover that is able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">withstand the presence of oxen but is unable to withstand the presence of camels, and camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>in that location. What actually transpired was that the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inside. </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: Since he was negligent concerning camels, he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent also concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rotting? Or perhaps we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>he was negligent concerning camels he is considered negligent concerning rotting, and since in practice he is not to blame for the incident, he is not held liable?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. And</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to </span>this that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that it is referring to where he covered it in a manner <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate for oxen and appropriate for camels</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside, </span>isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>Being unaware of this, <span class="gemarra-regular">what should he have done?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case where he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriately for camels, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>in that location? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the strength of the cover vis-à-vis oxen and camels is not relevant to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> here because the cover <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside. And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Apparently, we do not say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent concerning camels, he is </span>also considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent with regard to the rotting.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually, </span>the case is where the cover was <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate for camels and appropriate for oxen, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted from the inside. And as for </span>what was <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult for you </span>to explain: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted </span>from the inside, <span class="gemarra-regular">what should he have done, </span>and shouldn’t he be exempt? There is, nevertheless, a novelty in this ruling: It is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have gone and knocked on </span>the covering to ensure it was not hollow on the inside. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he is not required to check to this extent.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the continuation of the mishna: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that it is referring to where he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cover it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen and </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cover it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for camels, </span>does it <span class="gemarra-regular">need to be said that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>a case where he covered it <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriately for camels? </span>In this case, the following point needs clarification: <span class="gemarra-regular">If camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is negligent </span>and should be liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if camels are not </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it rotted from the inside, </span>and the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? Apparently, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is negligent concerning the camels, he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent concerning the rotting, </span>and he is therefore liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said</span> in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually </span>it is referring to where he covered the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately for oxen </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriately for camels; and camels are </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and camels came and weakened </span>the cover. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>subsequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen came and fell in. And as for </span>what was <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult for you </span>to explain: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that he is liable, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent, </span>so what novelty is being introduced? The answer is that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he </span>needs to <span class="gemarra-regular">cite the first clause </span>of the mishna, i.e., where he <span class="gemarra-regular">covered </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriately, he </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">cites</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the latter clause as well, </span>i.e., where he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cover it.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox</span> that was impaired by being <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf</span>, or an ox that was <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, or </span>an ox that was very <span class="gemarra-regular">young, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a blind </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the pit, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>If the ox was of <span class="gemarra-regular">standard intelligence </span>for its species <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">walking in the day, </span>the owner of the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since the ox should have been aware of the pit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>is he exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that since he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent concerning </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf</span> ox<span class="gemarra-regular">, he is also negligent concerning </span>an ox of <span class="gemarra-regular">standard intelligence. Rather, is it not </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span>the following principle <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>here: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>he is negligent with regard to one matter, it is also considered negligence with regard to another matter, but he is held liable only for the damage actually attributable to his negligence? The Gemara affirms: Yes, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: If a man was digging or widening a pit, and an ox passing by <span class="gemarra-regular">fell forward </span>into it in fright due to the sound of the digging, he is liable. If it fell backward into the pit due to the sound of the digging, he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says:</span> The term <span class="gemarra-regular">forward </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">literally forward, </span>and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">backward </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">literally backward, </span>

Daf 53a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>where it fell into <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>itself, but nevertheless if it fell backward, he is exempt.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rav says:</span> Damage classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit for which the Torah obligates him </span>to pay is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>damage caused by the pit’s lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>such as if an animal suffocates inside it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not to </span>damage caused by the <span class="gemarra-regular">impact</span> of hitting the ground, for which he is exempt from paying compensation. Since the ox in this case fell backward on its back, the owner of the pit is exempt from paying compensation, as the ox wasn’t killed by the lethal fumes of the pit, but by the impact of the fall.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>If the ox fell <span class="gemarra-regular">into the pit, whether </span>it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">forward </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">backward, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>With regard to damage classified as Pit, the Torah holds one liable for damage caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by its </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, and all the more so for </span>damage resulting from the <span class="gemarra-regular">impact </span>of the fall. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> according to Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances </span>concerning which the mishna stated that if the ox fell <span class="gemarra-regular">backward </span>into the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sound</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the digging that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>The Gemara answers: This applies, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">stumbled on the pit,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">fell behind the pit </span>and was injured <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the pit.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rav from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an animal that fell into <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, whether </span>it fell in <span class="gemarra-regular">forward </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it fell in <span class="gemarra-regular">backward, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>This constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of Rav.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>in explanation of how Rav’s opinion could accord with the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav concedes </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a pit on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if the animal fell backward, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the owner of the animal can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way you </span>look at it, you are liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>my animal <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>due <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">are your </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes. If </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>on account <span class="gemarra-regular">of the impact, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is the impact </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>land, and not the impact of land in the public domain, which is the typical case of Pit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that this is how the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be explained according to Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tumbled, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it began to <span class="gemarra-regular">fall on its face, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">tumbled and </span>continued to <span class="gemarra-regular">fall on its back. </span>In this case, he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because the </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, which were effective </span>in injuring the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span>in killing <span class="gemarra-regular">it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Here, </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>that is caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by the ox. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the damage? The damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it contaminated the water </span>in the pit, in which case the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it makes <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if the animal fell <span class="gemarra-regular">forward and </span>it makes <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">backward,</span> since he <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>either way.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in support of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav: </span>The verse states with regard to damage caused by a pit to an animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>an ox or a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>therein” (Exodus 21:33), which is interpreted to mean that one is not liable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">falls</span> in the usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of falling. From here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that if it <span class="gemarra-regular">fell forward due to the sound of the digging, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>but if it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">backward due to the sound of the digging, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case refer to damage <span class="gemarra-regular">by a pit.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the mishna: If it <span class="gemarra-regular">fell forward due to the sound of the digging, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say</span> that it is the sound of <span class="gemarra-regular">the digger </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the animal to fall, and not the pit itself. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, who says: The owner </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit causes the damage </span>by his digging, <span class="gemarra-regular">and anywhere that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not possible to collect </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>one who caused the fall, i.e., the digger, payment is <span class="gemarra-regular">collected from that</span> one, i.e., the owner of the pit. This is because in any event, he bears responsibility for the hazard he created.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that pushed another </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">into a pit, the owner of the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. Rabbi Natan says: The owner of the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">ox pays half </span>the amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of the pit pays half </span>the amount.
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Natan’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: </span>If an ox pushed another ox into a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the pit pays three-quarters, and the owner of the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">ox</span> pays <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter? </span>The Gemara resolves the contradiction: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an innocuous </span>ox that pushed the second ox. Therefore, the owner of the ox that caused damage pays only one-quarter of the cost of the damage, which is half of the half for which he is responsible. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a forewarned </span>ox that pushed a second ox. Consequently, the owner of the forewarned ox pays the full amount for which he is responsible, i.e., half the value of the total damage.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to an innocuous </span>ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does </span>Rabbi Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>as to why this person pays one-quarter and the owner of the pit pays three-quarters? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, i.e., the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">performed all the damage and the other, </span>i.e., the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>all the damage, then he should have ruled that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays half, </span>since they are both fully responsible. Although the ox was innocuous, the owner is still liable to pay half the cost of the damage, as that is the liability incurred for an act of damaging by an innocuous ox.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>Rabbi Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, i.e., the owner of the ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">performed half the damage, and that </span>one, i.e., the owner of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">performed half the damage, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the pit </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">pay half </span>of the amount for which he is responsible, i.e., half the cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner of the </span>innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>should pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">one-quarter, </span>which is half the amount for which he is responsible. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter,</span> the injured party has no recourse to claim it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">loses </span>it. Why, then, does Rabbi Natan hold that the owner of the pit pays for three-quarters of the damage?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Rabbi Natan is a judge and </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">plumbed the full depths of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Actually, he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">performed all of the damage and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">performed all of the damage. And as </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">your difficulty, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">should pay half and that </span>one should pay <span class="gemarra-regular">half, </span>that is not difficult. The owner of the ox pays only one-quarter, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the owner of the ox </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the owner of the pit: How</span> did <span class="gemarra-regular">my partnership </span>with you in this situation <span class="gemarra-regular">help me? </span>Even if my ox caused all the damage and none of the damage was caused by the pit, I would be required to pay only half the cost of the damage. Therefore, as we are partners in this situation, I should pay half of what I should have paid, which is one-quarter. You should pay the other half of what I should have paid, in addition to your share, since you would have had to pay full damages.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rabbi Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">performed half the damage and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">performed half the damage. As </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">your difficulty </span>with the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the pit </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">pay half and the owner of the ox </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">pay one-quarter, and </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">loses the other </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter, </span>that is not difficult. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the owner of the </span>killed <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the owner of the pit: I found my ox in your pit. </span>Consequently, I am assuming that <span class="gemarra-regular">you killed it. </span>Therefore, concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>portion of the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">that I can receive from the other,</span> i.e., the owner of the damaging ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will receive </span>it. Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">that I am unable to receive from the other </span>individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will receive it from you.</span>
On the same subject, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">left a stone at the opening of a pit </span>belonging to another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox came and stumbled on it and fell into the pit, we have arrived at the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis </span>concerning the division of responsibility between them. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>since what is the difference whether the ox fell into the pit due to another ox pushing it or due to the stone?
The Gemara answers: This ruling needed to be stated explicitly, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">there the owner of the pit </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the owner of the ox </span>who was responsible for the damage: <span class="gemarra-regular">If not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">my pit, your ox would have killed </span>the second ox anyway, in which case my pit was not the cause of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, the owner of the stone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can say to the owner of the pit: If not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">your pit, what would my stone have done? If </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">would have stumbled on it, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">would have </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">fallen and gotten up, </span>and I should be exempt. Therefore, Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this claim is not a valid one, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the owner of the pit can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner of the stone: <span class="gemarra-regular">If not for </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">stone, </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">would not have fallen into the pit </span>in the first place.
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>

Daf 53b

There is a dispute with regard to a case of an ordinary innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox and a disqualified consecrated ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that gored </span>another ox together. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this case of an ox that was consecrated and disqualified? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn ox that </span>became blemished and was consequently disqualified as an offering. Nevertheless, its initial consecration remains, and therefore it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed. </span>Consequently, the priest in possession of it is not liable to pay damages, since it is not classified as: The ox of another, as its status is not that of a non-sacred ox belonging to a person. Given this background, what is the liability of the owner of the non-sacred ox that gored together with it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: He pays half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: He pays one-quarter of </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage.</span>
The Gemara explains the dispute: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> one, Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, Ravina, refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the ordinary ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous. This </span>opinion stated by Ravina is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>that each party is responsible for only half the damage. Since the non-sacred ox was innocuous, its owner pays half the cost of the damage for which he is responsible, i.e., one-quarter of the total. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>opinion stated by Abaye is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan </span>that each party in turn is responsible for all the damage. Consequently, since the non-sacred ox is innocuous, its owner pays half the total amount.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead that there is no dispute, and that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, Ravina, state their opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. This </span>one, Ravina, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>where the non-sacred ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous, </span>and so its owner pays half of a half, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, Abaye, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>where the non-sacred ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>so its owner pays his entire share, i.e., half the total damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that there was another version of this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says </span>that he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: </span>He pays <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage. </span>The Gemara explains their reasoning: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>where the ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned. This </span>one, Abaye, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>that each one is responsible for half the damage, and so he pays his share of half the total cost of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>one, Ravina, holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, </span>that each one is fully responsible for the damage, and when one perpetrator of the damage is exempt from payment, such as this case, the entire amount is collected from the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead that there is no dispute, and that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, Ravina, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>where the ox was <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>and the owner pays the full cost of the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> one, Abaye, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>ox, for which only half the cost of the damage is paid.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and a person that push </span>a person or animal <span class="gemarra-regular">into a pit, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>that they caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">they, </span>i.e., the man who pushed the person or animal, the owner of the ox, and the owner of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">are all liable </span>to pay the indemnity of damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Concerning the four</span> additional <span class="gemarra-regular">types of indemnity, </span>which are loss of livelihood, pain, medical costs, and humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for</span> miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>who pushed is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since the Torah did not impose any obligation on them to pay these payments.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">ransom </span>if it was a person who was pushed and killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also concerning the <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span>shekels paid <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave</span> who was killed, the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the man </span>who did the pushing <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pit </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> With regard to vessels </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a disqualified consecrated ox </span>that fell into the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">the man </span>who did the pushing <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, and </span>the owner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
Rava explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the owner of the pit is exempt from liability for damage caused to a disqualified consecrated ox? Since <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to a pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him”</span> (Exodus 21:34), it teaches that the obligation to pay damages is imposed only <span class="gemarra-regular">on the one to whom the carcass </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs, </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding this</span> case of a disqualified consecrated ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the carcass does not belong to him. </span>In this case, it is prohibited to sell the carcass. The owner of the pit cannot derive benefit from it, and it no longer belongs to anyone, so the conditions written in the verse are not in effect.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>this matter was <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to Rava? Is it not a dilemma </span>that was already raised <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rava, as Rava asked: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit? </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him,” </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one </span>to whom <span class="gemarra-regular">the carcass belongs, </span>i.e., the owner of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the carcass does not belong to him, </span>and therefore the owner is exempt from paying for it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him” comes to teach that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to, </span>i.e., retains ownership of, <span class="gemarra-regular">the carcass, </span>and the perpetrator of the damage pays him the difference?
The Gemara answers: Initially, Rava was in doubt about the matter, but <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemma,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolved it </span>and concluded that the verse imposes liability for the cost of damage only on a person to whom the carcass belongs, excluding the case of a disqualified consecrated ox.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, from where does he </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> attends to the animal carcass? </span>The Gemara answers: He <span class="gemarra-regular">derives it from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him” </span>(Exodus 21:36), stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Ox.</span> The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did you see </span>to determine <span class="gemarra-regular">that from </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him,”</span> stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Ox, you derive </span>from it the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of the dead ox <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to the carcass, </span>and from the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass belongs to him,” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Pit, you derive from it </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that only <span class="gemarra-regular">the one to whom the carcass belongs </span>pays damages? Why can’t <span class="gemarra-regular">I reverse </span>the derivations from each verse and say the opposite?
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">exemption </span>applies to the verse stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Pit, since </span>the Torah also <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>one from paying for damage classified as Pit caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>that fall into it and break. The Gemara challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>one could claim that the <span class="gemarra-regular">exemption </span>applies to the verse stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Ox, since </span>the Torah also <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted </span>the owner from <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage </span>in the case of an innocuous ox. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, we do not find </span>that the owner of the ox is exempt from compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>By contrast, with regard to Pit, there are certain items for which a person is not liable at all. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Torah is more lenient in cases of Pit than of Ox.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and its accoutrements, </span>i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">were broken, </span>or if a donkey and its accoutrements fell in and the accoutrements were torn, the owner of the pit is liable for damage to the animal caused by the pit, but he is exempt from liability for damage caused to the vessels, by Torah edict. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda obligates </span>a person to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels in </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Rabbis? Since the verse states: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein” </span>(Exodus 21:33), it is inferred that it is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, but not a person, </span>for whose death the owner of the pit is liable. Moreover, one is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey, but not vessels. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>expounds the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>in the expression “an ox or a donkey” <span class="gemarra-regular">to include vessels. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>explain the word “or”? 

Daf 54a

The word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to separate </span>the cases of the ox and donkey. This indicates that if either falls in individually, the owner of the pit is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to separate </span>the cases in the verse? He derives it <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the use of the singular form of the verb: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>an ox or donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">fall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">venafal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>indicating that he is liable if even one animal falls. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>maintain that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">and fall </span>can also <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate many </span>animals, as the use of the singular form of a verb does not prove that the subject is necessarily singular.
The Gemara now challenges both opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“and fall” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>whereas the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“an ox or a donkey” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail. </span>According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, when the Torah presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a detail, the generalization </span>includes <span class="gemarra-regular">only what </span>is contained <span class="gemarra-regular">in the detail. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and a donkey</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>included, but <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>included.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: The following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The owner of the pit shall pay” </span>(Exodus 21:34), means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it then generalized </span>again. The verses are structured according to the principle of halakhic exegesis of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</span> According to this principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">you may deduce </span>that the verses are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items that are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail. </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the explicit detail </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">animals, so too, all </span>items included in the generalization must be <span class="gemarra-regular">animals.</span>
The Gemara now challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the explicit detail, </span>i.e., the ox and donkey, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">items whose carcass renders </span>a person ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure by contact or by carrying, so too,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all items, </span>i.e., all animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose carcass renders </span>a person ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure through contact or by carrying, </span>should be included in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damage classified as Pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But birds, </span>whose carcasses do not render a person impure through contact or by carrying, would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be included.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let the Merciful One write </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one detail, </span>from which the exclusion of birds could be derived. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>detail <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">write? If </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would say </span>that an item that <span class="gemarra-regular">is sacrificed on the altar, </span>such as an ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not sacrificed on the altar </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>render him liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful One writes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would say: </span>Those animals whose <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified, </span>such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), do <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>render their owners liable, but animals whose <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not sanctified </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>render them liable. Therefore, the Torah states both an ox and a donkey.
The original difficulty therefore resurfaces: Why is the verse not expounded as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, thereby excluding birds? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the previous method of deriving liability for a pit must be rejected, and instead it should be derived as follows: The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And the carcass shall be for him” </span>(Exodus 21:34), from which it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything subject to death </span>is included.
The Gemara asks: If this is the basis for liability for a pit, then <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to the Rabbis, who exclude vessels </span>from liability based on another verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">and according to Rabbi Yehuda, who has amplified </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to include <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, </span>one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are vessels subject to death? </span>Clearly, vessels cannot be subject to death. Why, then, is a separate source necessary to derive their halakhic status? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in reply: Vessels may also be considered subject to death in the sense that <span class="gemarra-regular">their shattering is </span>tantamount to <span class="gemarra-regular">their deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h.</span>
The Gemara continues to challenge this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rav, who says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for which the Torah deems </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, but not for </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">the impact </span>of the fall, the following question may be raised <span class="gemarra-regular">both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Yehuda: Are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels capable </span>of being broken by the lethal <span class="gemarra-regular">fumes, </span>such that a verse is necessary to exclude them? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> in reply: There is such a case concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">which crack from the fumes.</span>
The Gemara asks further: But isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for that which Rava </span>ruled, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit, </span>the owner of the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.” </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a person to <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">carcass belongs, </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding this </span>person, to <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">carcass</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not belong. </span>Once a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> has already been derived from this verse, it cannot be used as the basis for deriving a second <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of liability for Pit must be derived from another source. The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states </span>concerning Pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall recompense money to its owners” </span>(Exodus 21:34), thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">including any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that has an owner </span>within the scope of liability. The Gemara challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even vessels and people </span>should be included <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>which presents a difficulty for all opinions.
The Gemara answers: This is why <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “An ox,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but not a person; “a donkey,” but not vessels. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rabbi Yehuda, who amplifies </span>the scope of liability to include <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, granted </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“an ox” </span>is necessary, as he <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people based on it, </span>for which he is not liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“a donkey,” what </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude based on it?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Pit, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“sheep” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:1), stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a lost </span>item, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>(see <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 27a) are <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>There is no explanation for why they are stated.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeresh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shoteh</span> ox <span class="gemarra-regular">or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span> ox <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>the pit, the owner of the pit is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeresh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shoteh</span> ox <span class="gemarra-regular">or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span> ox? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it means: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox belonging to a deaf-mute [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeresh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], an ox belonging to an imbecile [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shoteh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox belonging to a minor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>then it can be inferred that if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>belonging to a halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent </span>adult, the owner of the pit would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>What would be the reason for this exemption?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>Instead, it should be interpreted as: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox that is </span>impaired by being <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is an imbecile, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">young. </span>

Daf 54b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>can it be inferred that if <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is of </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence </span>fell into a pit, the owner of the pit would be <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary,</span> and should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to state that if <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is of </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence </span>fell into a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the pit’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf, an imbecile, or </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">young, say </span>that it was not due to the pit alone that it fell in, but <span class="gemarra-regular">its deafness caused it </span>to fall in or <span class="gemarra-regular">its young age caused it </span>to fall in, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">should be exempt. </span>Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he is liable in these cases as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa said to Ravina:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a living being that is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent fell into </span>a pit, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What, is it not </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent? </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> No, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person. </span>Rav Aḥa challenges this response: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>you should then infer that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only for the injuries of a <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but </span>if one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not mentally competent, </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>But the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“an ox” is written </span>in the Torah as causing liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not a person.</span>
Rava responded to Rav Aḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>does the term <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent</span> mean? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a species </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent, </span>and thereby includes all humans in the exemption from liability. Rav Aḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox</span> that was <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent fell inside it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that Rabbi Yirmeya’s explanation should be rejected, and the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is deaf, an ox that is an imbecile,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and an ox that is </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">young, </span>for which he is liable; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is </span>of standard <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason? </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">should have looked carefully</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">walking. </span>If it did not, it is responsible for its own injury. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>idea <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to an <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">deaf, an imbecile, or </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">young, blind, or </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">walking at night </span>and unable to see, if it <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into </span>a pit, the pit’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>But if the ox is of standard <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence </span>or is <span class="gemarra-regular">walking during the day, </span>the pit’s owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since normal behavior for oxen is that, ordinarily, they watch where they are going and avoid pits.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox or whether </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">animal with regard to </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">falling </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and with regard to </span>keeping its <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Mount Sinai </span>at the time of the receiving of the Torah, when it was forbidden for any animal to ascend the mountain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to the payment of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double </span>the principal by a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to</span> the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning a lost item, and with regard to unloading </span>its burden, and <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">muzzling </span>it while threshing, and <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, and with regard to </span>the prohibition against its working on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, undomesticated animals and birds </span>are subject to the same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>domesticated animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>all of the above <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the Torah only in reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox or a donkey? Rather, </span>the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse speaks of a common </span>scenario, from which the other cases may be derived.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the sources for all of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> enumerated in the mishna that apply to all animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to falling </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “He shall recompense money to its owners” </span>(Exodus 21:34), which means that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that has owners </span>is included, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we mentioned </span>(see 54a). <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the requirement that animals keep their <span class="gemarra-regular">distance</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">Mount Sinai </span>before the giving of the Torah, this is derived from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whether it be animal or person, it shall not live” </span>(Exodus 19:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an undomesticated animal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">included in </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">animal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">behema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span> In addition, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“whether” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include birds.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the double payment</span> of a thief, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we say </span>in a halakhic exegesis of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For any matter of trespass” </span>(Exodus 22:8), that it is a general statement which <span class="gemarra-regular">includes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any matter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence. With regard to </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning a lost item, </span>the verse states comprehensively: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For every lost thing of your brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">unloading </span>a burden, <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat,</span> as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey </span>is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">muzzling </span>an animal, mentioned in the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>is employed in the context of muzzling, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, if </span>it is referring to the prohibition against using <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for plowing, </span>due to which it is forbidden to plow with an ox and a donkey together (see Deuteronomy 22:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>is employed in the context of plowing with diverse kinds, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox”</span> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for crossbreeding, derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>as the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle” </span>is employed in the context of crossbreeding animals (see Leviticus 19:19), and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle” </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Exodus 20:10), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning Shabbat </span>itself that the words “ox” and “donkey” are referring to all types of animals? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: In the first </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Your manservant, your maidservant, nor your cattle” </span>(Exodus 20:10), whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">in the second </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle” </span>(Deuteronomy 5:14). Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">aren’t an ox and a donkey </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">included in </span>the category of: <span class="gemarra-regular">All animals, </span>which are included in the term “cattle”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, were they <span class="gemarra-regular">specified? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">To teach you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">ox and donkey that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated here, undomesticated animals and birds </span>have the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as them, so too, </span>everywhere that an ox and donkey are mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">undomesticated animals and birds </span>have the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as them.</span>
The Gemara asks: But why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the verses be expounded as follows: The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“cattle” </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>and the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“your ox and your donkey” </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail. </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">detail, </span>the principles of halakhic exegesis dictate that <span class="gemarra-regular">the generalization includes only what </span>is specified <span class="gemarra-regular">in the detail. </span>Therefore, with regard to this subject, <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and a donkey </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>be included, but <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be included.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in reply: In the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“nor any of your cattle” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments </span>following the phrase “your ox and your donkey,” <span class="gemarra-regular">it then generalized </span>again. Therefore, the verse is structured as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. </span>According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, <span class="gemarra-regular">you may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as animals, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so too, all </span>items included in the general term must be <span class="gemarra-regular">animals.</span>
The Gemara challenges the answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as an item, </span>i.e., an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose carcass renders </span>a person ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure through contact or through carrying, so too, all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">items whose carcass renders </span>a person ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure through contact or through carrying </span>should be included. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birds, </span>whose carcasses do not render one impure through contact or through carrying, should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be included.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let the Merciful One write </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one detail </span>from which this could be derived. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>detail <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Merciful One write? If the Merciful One writes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would say: </span>An animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">is sacrificed on the altar, </span>such as an ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not sacrificed on the altar </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>render him liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful One writes </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey, I would say:</span> An animal whose <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified, </span>such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), does <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>render him liable, but an animal whose <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not sanctified </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>render him liable. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>and a donkey.
Consequently, there is no redundancy, and each detail is required for correctly deriving other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. If so, the previous question resurfaces: Why are the verses not expounded such that the prohibition does not include birds? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Nor any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vekhol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of your cattle,” </span>should be understood as <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification, </span>encompassing any item that is even partially similar to the detail.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that the Merciful One states </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>intended as an <span class="gemarra-regular">amplification? But concerning tithes, where it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we expound </span>the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a detail, </span>rather than using the method of amplification and restriction.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning second-tithe money brought to Jerusalem: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall give the money for anything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekhol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] your soul desires” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:26), which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>followed by: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,” </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail, </span>and concludes with: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or for anything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvkhol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] your soul asks of you,” </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it then generalized </span>again.
Therefore, the verse is structured as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. </span>According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, <span class="gemarra-regular">you may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as produce of produce, </span>i.e., they grow from a parent organism, such as agricultural produce or animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from the ground, </span>i.e., their sustenance comes from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>it includes <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>things that are <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of produce and are grown from the ground. </span>It is evident from here that the method of a generalization and a detail is used in connection with the term “kol,” as opposed to interpreting it as an amplification.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: A distinction may be drawn between the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For anything [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekhol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],”</span> as in: “Any of your cattle,” which is <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a generalization as well, </span>in addition to “for anything [<span class="it-text">bekhol</span>].” <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>word <span class="gemarra-regular">“any,” </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">here, is an amplification. </span>This is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">since it could have written: And your cattle, as it is written in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments, and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">it writes: “Nor any of your cattle.” Learn from </span>this that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification </span>and encompasses other animals as well.
The Gemara continues to analyze this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” is an amplification, why do I </span>need the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle,” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments, and </span>the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">“an ox or a donkey,” </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments? </span>The phrase “and any of your cattle” already includes any animal.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response: Each of these terms is required. The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">muzzling, </span>as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>is employed in the context of muzzling, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat.
The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey” </span>can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">unloading </span>a burden, as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey” </span>is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey” </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14).
The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle” </span>can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, </span>as the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle”</span> is employed in the context of crossbreeding animals (see Leviticus 19:19), and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“your cattle” </span>is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Exodus 20:10).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that this redundancy is the source for extending the prohibition of diverse kinds, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">should be prohibited even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>to plow together with an ox or another animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 8:6): It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to plow and pull with any of them, </span>indicating that the prohibition relates only to animals?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>The Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">Paphunya know the reason for this matter, and who </span>are these Sages? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</span> who resided in Paphunya. The reason is that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“You shall not perform any labor, neither you, your son, your daughter, your slave, your maidservant, your ox, your donkey, any of your animals, or the stranger residing within your city gates, <span class="gemarra-regular">that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you” </span>(Deuteronomy 5:14), as if to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have equated </span>people with animals only <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning resting </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not with regard to another matter.</span>
Having discussed some differences between the two versions of the Ten Commandments, the Gemara now discuses a related matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina ben Agil asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For what reason is </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good not stated in the first </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter </span>version of the Ten <span class="gemarra-regular">Commandments, </span>

Daf 55a

in the context of the mitzva to honor one’s parents, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good is stated there: </span>“In order that it shall be good for you” (Deuteronomy 5:16)? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Before you ask me why </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good is stated, ask me if </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">stated there or not, since</span> I am not sufficiently proficient in my knowledge of the biblical verses to remember the precise wording, and <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good is stated there or not. Go to Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai, who was </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">found at </span>the academy of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, who was an expert in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Perhaps he heard something from him on this matter and can answer your question.
Rabbi Ḥanina ben Agil <span class="gemarra-regular">went to him </span>and asked him. Rabbi Tanḥum <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I did not hear </span>anything on this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">himself. But this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Naḥum, the brother of the mother of Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said to me, and some say</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">the father of the mother of Rav Aḥai, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: </span>It does not mention the word good in the first tablets, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately </span>destined <span class="gemarra-regular">to be broken </span>after the Jews made the Golden Calf.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it had mentioned the term good, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they were ultimately </span>destined <span class="gemarra-regular">to break, what of it? Rav Ashi said: </span>If this term had been mentioned in the first tablets, all <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>would have, <span class="gemarra-regular">God forbid, ceased from Israel </span>once they were broken. Therefore, only the second version, which was written after the breaking of the tablets, contains the word good, so that there would always be good for the Jewish people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sees</span> the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">tet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his dream, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a good sign for him. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? If we say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">good [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is written </span>in the Torah and begins with the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span>, then one could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that it is an allusion to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will sweep it with the broom [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vetetetiha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bemate’ateh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of destruction” </span>(Isaiah 14:23), which also contains the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span> several times but is referring to punishment. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We mean </span>that when someone sees <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tet</span> in his dream, it is a good sign, but this latter verse contains several.
The Gemara asks: This latter statement is problematic, as even according to this explanation, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that a single letter <span class="it-text">tet</span> alludes to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Her filthiness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumatah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is in her skirts” </span>(Lamentations 1:9), which begins with the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span>. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We mean </span>that when one sees the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">tet</span> together with the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">bet</span> in his dream, it is a good sign for him, as the word <span class="it-text">tov</span> is written with both. The Gemara asks further: According to this, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it alludes to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Her gates are sunk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tave’u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] into the ground” </span>(Lamentations 2:9), which begins with the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span> followed by the letter <span class="it-text">bet</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is not merely because it is the first letter of the word good [<span class="it-text">tov</span>] that it is considered a good omen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the Torah initially introduces </span>the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span> in a context <span class="gemarra-regular">of good, </span>with the word good [<span class="it-text">tov</span>] itself, it is a good omen. <span class="gemarra-regular">As from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">bereshit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the first word in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And God saw that the light </span>was good [<span class="it-text">tov</span>]” (Genesis 1:4), the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">tet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not written </span>anywhere.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sees a eulogy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hesped</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his dream, </span>it is an allusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">in Heaven they had pity [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥasu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] on him and saved him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eda’uhu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>from actually being eulogized. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This statement </span>applies specifically when he actually saw the word: Eulogy [<span class="it-text">hesped</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">in writing.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, undomesticated animals and birds </span>are subject to the same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>domesticated animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: Here Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a ruling from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that illustrates the statement that birds and undomesticated animals are also subject to the prohibition of diverse kinds: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cock, a peacock [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tavvas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and a pheasant [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufasyonei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds with </span>respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">each other, </span>since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to birds as well.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span>what novelty is stated here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥaviva said: </span>The novelty here is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">reared together.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lest you say: </span>Since they are reared together, they <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>essentially <span class="gemarra-regular">one species,</span> and not considered diverse kinds. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that they are actually separate species, and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of diverse kinds do apply to them.
Following the discussion of the prohibition of diverse kinds as it relates to birds, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The domestic <span class="gemarra-regular">goose and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wild goose </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to each other</span> and are not one species. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Ḥanan objects to this: What is the reason? If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the beak o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">long and the beak of that one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">short, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if that is so, </span>then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Persian camel and an Arabian camel, where the neck of this one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">thick and the neck of that one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">thin, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">should indeed be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to one another. </span>Clearly, though, the camels are in fact two variants of a single species.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye says: </span>That is not the reason, but rather another difference exists between the domestic goose and the wild goose, concerning the male: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>type, i.e., the wild goose, <span class="gemarra-regular">its testicles </span>are visible <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside, and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, i.e., the domestic goose, <span class="gemarra-regular">its testicles are inside. Rav Pappa said </span>that another difference exists between them, concerning the female: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, i.e., the wild goose, <span class="gemarra-regular">releases </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one egg in </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">ovary </span>and later releases another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, i.e., the domestic goose, <span class="gemarra-regular">releases several eggs </span>at once <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">ovary. </span>Consequently, they are not considered to be the same species.
In connection with the prohibition of diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who crossbreeds two species </span>of creatures <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>live <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is flogged </span>for transgressing the prohibition of crossbreeding diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason, </span>i.e., where is there an allusion to this in the Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said in the name of Ulla: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>from a verbal analogy between the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“According to its species [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leminehu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 1:21), referring to animals living <span class="gemarra-regular">on dry land, </span>and the same term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“According to its species [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leminehu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 1:25), referring to sea creatures. In the same way that the former may not be crossbred, similarly, the latter may not be crossbred.
The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who drives </span>a wagon on the seashore <span class="gemarra-regular">with a goat and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shibbuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a certain species of fish, together, pulled by the goat on land and the fish at sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Has he violated the prohibition against performing labor with diverse kinds, in the same way that one does when plowing with an ox and a donkey together, or not? The two sides of the question are as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since the goat does not descend into the sea and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shibbuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not ascend onto the land, </span>they are not working together at all, and so he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>forbidden? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">now driving </span>the wagon with both of them, he thereby transgresses the prohibition?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina objects to this: But if that is so </span>that one is liable, then if a person <span class="gemarra-regular">joined wheat and barley </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hand and sowed the wheat in Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">and the barley outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, where the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply to seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable. </span>Clearly, however, they are two distinct regions, and the seeds are not considered to be mixed together.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response to this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can</span> these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>in the case of planting diverse kinds of seeds, it is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the location</span> subject to this <span class="gemarra-regular">obligation, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a location </span>subject to this <span class="gemarra-regular">obligation. Here, </span>by contrast, in the case of the person driving a wagon, both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>location, i.e., the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>location, i.e., the sea, are <span class="gemarra-regular">locations </span>subject to this <span class="gemarra-regular">obligation. </span>Consequently, if one works together two different species either on the land or in the sea, he is liable. Therefore, the question is a valid one.


Daf 55b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who brough</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his flock of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep into the pen and locked </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">before it </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>despite this sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage </span>in another person’s field by eating produce or trampling it, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since he safeguarded the animals appropriately. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not lock </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the sheep in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate, and </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since his negligence led to the damage.
If the owner locked the door appropriately but the wall of the pen <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or bandits breached it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>sheep subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage </span>by eating or trampling, the owner of the sheep is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from liability. If the <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>of the pen and the animals subsequently caused damage, the <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sun, </span>causing it to suffer, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he conveyed it to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, </span>who are not able to safeguard it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>because he was negligent.
If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to a shepherd </span>to care for it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the shepherd enters in his place </span>and is responsible for the damage.
If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into a garden and derives benefit </span>from produce there, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">derives</span> and not for other damage caused. If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>into the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">in its usual manner and caused damage </span>there, its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged. How does </span>the court appraise the value of the damage when the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged? </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>a large piece of land with <span class="gemarra-regular">an area required for </span>sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of seed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that field, </span>including the garden bed in which the damage took place. This appraisal includes <span class="gemarra-regular">how much it was worth </span>before the animal damaged it <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much is it worth </span>now, and the owner must pay the difference. The court appraises not only the garden bed that was eaten or trampled, rather the depreciation in value of the bed as part of the surrounding area. This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>This principle of appraisal applies only in a case where the animal ate unripe produce; but if <span class="gemarra-regular">it ate ripe produce,</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ripe produce. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it ate <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of produce, he pays for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it ate <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he pays for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the definition of locking the door in a manner that is appropriate. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: What is </span>considered locking in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate, and what is </span>considered locking in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriate? </span>If one locked the <span class="gemarra-regular">door </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is able to withstand a typical wind </span>without collapsing or opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate, </span>whereas if he locked the door such <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is unable to withstand a typical wind, this is </span>considered a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not appropriate.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani bar Patish said: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>with regard to animals that are <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned that it is sufficient </span>for the owner to provide only <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced safeguarding? </span>Since the mishna deals with damage categorized as Eating or Trampling, for which all animals are considered forewarned, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>must be in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned </span>in a mishna (45b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">tied it with rein</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">or locked </span>the gate <span class="gemarra-regular">before it </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate, but </span>nevertheless the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, whether </span>the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>because this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous animal. But if the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment of damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse describing the liability for damage caused by a forewarned animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the owner has not secured it” </span>(Exodus 21:36), <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <span class="gemarra-regular">was secured. Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>A forewarned ox <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding </span>at all <span class="gemarra-regular">other than </span>slaughtering it with <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife. </span>According to this mishna, only Rabbi Yehuda maintains that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to render exempt from liability the owner of an ox that is forewarned.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who holds that the owner of a forewarned ox is liable even if he provides only reduced safeguarding. Although animals are considered forewarned with regard to Eating and Trampling, one cannot apply to them a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated with regard to an animal that is forewarned with regard to Goring. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling since the Torah limited </span>the required standard of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them. As </span>the <span class="it-text">amora</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says, and some say it was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four matters </span>for which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah limited their </span>required standard of <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding, and these are: Pit, and Fire, Eating, and Trampling.</span>
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pit? As it is written: “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, </span>and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:33). One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he covered it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability, even though it is possible that the pit would become uncovered in the future.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Fire? As it is written: “The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation” </span>(Exodus 22:5), which is interpreted to mean that one is exempt from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he acts </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to actively <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling </span>the fire in another’s property by being negligent.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating? As it is written: </span>“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he set his animal loose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it feed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvi’er</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the field of another” </span>(Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner does not bear liability <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he acts </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to causing his animal to <span class="gemarra-regular">feed </span>there, by being negligent.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling? As it is written: </span>“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he set </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">loose [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veshilaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],</span> and it feed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner is not liable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he acts </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">setting </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">loose.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the term <span class="gemarra-italic">veshilaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This </span>is referring to damage by <span class="gemarra-regular">Trampling, and similarly, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “That send forth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meshaleḥei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the feet of the ox and the donkey” </span>(Isaiah 32:20). With regard to the term <span class="gemarra-italic">uvi’er</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This </span>is referring to damage by <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating, and similarly, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “As one consumes with the tooth, until it be all gone” </span>(I Kings 14:10).
Evidently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the owner’s liability is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that he acted </span>in a manner that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>setting the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">loose </span>or causing it <span class="gemarra-regular">to feed. </span>One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not act </span>in such a manner, even if he provided only reduced safeguarding, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> precise, as it taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> specifically with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep. </span>This raises the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since we have been dealing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>in all the previous <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>this mishna also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox. What is different </span>in this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep? Is it not because the Torah limited </span>its requirements specifically with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the safeguarding </span>against damage that is more likely to be caused by sheep, i.e., caused by Eating and Trampling, since sheep are unlikely to gore? If so, the wording of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who holds that a reduced level of supervision is sufficient only with regard to Eating and Trampling, but not Goring.
The Gemara rejects this: One can <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>necessarily derive from the wording of the mishna that it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Perhaps the mishna specifically uses the case of sheep to teach the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>if it would have used an example of an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>one might have thought that it also includes damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">Goring, </span>about which it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah that reduced supervision is sufficient. Therefore, the mishna specifically uses the example of sheep, to indicate damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is written </span>that reduced supervision is sufficient. And <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us that </span>only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling, for </span>which animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned </span>from the outset, is reduced supervision sufficient according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara concludes that this is a valid reading of the mishna and one may <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>it that the mishna may even be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua said: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four matters </span>in which one <span class="gemarra-regular">who commits </span>an offense concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and it would be proper for him to pay compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who breaches a fenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">before another’s animal, </span>thereby allowing the animal to escape; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who bends another’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>grain <span class="gemarra-regular">before a fire </span>so that it catches fire; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who hires false witnesses to testify; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one who knows testimony </span>in support <span class="gemarra-regular">of another but does not testify on his behalf.</span>
The Gemara clarifies each of the cases listed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says: </span>With regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who breaches a fence </span>that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">before another’s animal, what are the circumstances? If we say </span>it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of a stable wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that would not have fallen by itself, the one who breached it <span class="gemarra-regular">should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also be liable according to human laws, </span>at least for the damage caused to the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>here

Daf 56a

the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of an unstable wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that was about to fall and break in any event, and so his action did not actually cause any loss to the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says: </span>With regard to the case mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who bends another’s standing </span>grain <span class="gemarra-regular">before a fire, what are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fire would <span class="gemarra-regular">reach </span>the bent grain <span class="gemarra-regular">in a typical wind, let him </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be liable </span>for the damage according to <span class="gemarra-regular">human laws. Rather, </span>it must be a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fire could <span class="gemarra-regular">reach </span>the bent grain only <span class="gemarra-regular">in an atypical wind. </span>Therefore, he is exempt according to human laws, and, since the grain was destroyed due to his action, he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ashi </span>offered an alternative explanation and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>item; in other words, this person did not bend the grain toward the fire but bent it over another item in order to conceal it. One is not liable to pay restitution for concealed items damaged by fire. Therefore, when this person bent the grain over an item, he caused indirect damage to the owner of that item <span class="gemarra-regular">because he made it into a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed </span>item that was subsequently damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">fire, </span>and the owner cannot reclaim his loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says: </span>With regard to the case mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who hires false witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what are the circumstances? If we say </span>that he hired them <span class="gemarra-regular">for his own </span>benefit, in order to extract payment from another, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to reimburse </span>that person with <span class="gemarra-regular">money,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he is liable according to human laws </span>for receiving money under false circumstances. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case is one where he hired false witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a case the injured party cannot sue the other litigant, since the latter did not hire the witnesses, nor can he sue the person who hired them, since that person received no personal benefit.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who knows testimony in support of anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but does not testify on his behalf </span>is exempt from liability according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing? If we say </span>that the case <span class="gemarra-regular">involves two </span>people who could testify, and their evidence would render the other party liable to pay, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that each of them is liable according to the laws of Heaven; he has committed a transgression <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” </span>(Leviticus 5:1). Therefore, it is unnecessary for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to mention this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">concerns a single </span>witness, whose testimony is not sufficient to render another liable, and to which the transgression of Torah law consequently does not apply. Nevertheless, a litigant can be forced to take an oath based on the testimony of a single witness, and refusal to take this oath would obligate the litigant to pay. Therefore, the witness has caused an indirect loss and is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there nothing else, </span>i.e., is there no other case in which one is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven? <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>such a case. And before citing several cases that are not written in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who performs; with poison; and an agent; another; is broken. </span>The Gemara returns to the first case: One <span class="gemarra-regular">who performs labor with water of purification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which were meant to be used to purify one rendered ritually impure by a corpse, thereby rendering the water unfit for use, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>who performs labor <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer of purification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> invalidating the animal for use as an element of the purification ritual, is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws, </span>since the damage he caused is not evident, <span class="gemarra-regular">but liable according to the laws of Heaven, </span>as he caused a financial loss.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the following <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places poiso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before another’s animal,</span> and the animal eats it and dies, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws, </span>since the animal caused its own death, <span class="gemarra-regular">but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends </span>an exposed <span class="gemarra-regular">flame in the hand of a deaf-mute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an imbecile, or a minor, </span>and the fire spreads, causing damage; he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who frightens anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> without touching him, but causes him injury; he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">whose jug broke in the public domain and he did not remove </span>the broken pieces, or one <span class="gemarra-regular">whose camel fell and he did not stand it up </span>again. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir deems </span>the owner of jug or of the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the damage thereby caused to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Since there are so many other cases, why did Rabbi Yehoshua claim in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that there are only four cases when one is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, there are, in any event, many </span>other cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>Rabbi Yehoshua held that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for him </span>to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>four cases. The reason he stated them is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">one should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in these cases one is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
The Gemara explains why one might have thought that there is no liability at all for each case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who breaches a fence </span>that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">before another’s animal, </span>thereby allowing the animal to escape, is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: Since </span>the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">is about to collapse </span>even without this person’s intervention, <span class="gemarra-regular">what did </span>he really <span class="gemarra-regular">do? </span>Based on that logic, one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who bends another’s standing </span>grain is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: Let </span>the one who bent the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did I know that an atypical wind would come </span>and cause the fire to spread? Based on that logic, one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Ashi, who said </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>item, Rabbi Yehoshua mentioned liability according to the laws of Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that the one who concealed the item could say: <span class="gemarra-regular">I covered it for you</span> in order to protect it from the fire. Based on that logic, one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehoshua taught that there is liability <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who hires false witnesses, lest you say: Let </span>the one who hired them <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>If the witnesses hear <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of the teacher, </span>i.e., God, Who prohibited giving false testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the statement of the student, </span>i.e., the one who hired them, <span class="gemarra-regular">to whose statement </span>should they <span class="gemarra-regular">listen? </span>Although the one who hired them encouraged these witnesses to sin, ultimately it was they who transgressed by not adhering to the instructions of God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>based on this logic one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
Finally, Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who knows testimony </span>in support <span class="gemarra-regular">of another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but does not testify on his behalf </span>is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that the witness could claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who says that had I come forward </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">testified on behalf of </span>one litigant, the other litigant <span class="gemarra-regular">would admit </span>liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he would have </span>chosen to <span class="gemarra-regular">take a false oath </span>and absolve himself. Based on that logic one might have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
§ The mishna teaches: If the pen <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached at night, or bandits breached it, </span>and sheep subsequently went out and caused damage, the owner of the sheep is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: And this </span>first instance of a pen that was breached is referring specifically to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tunneled </span>under the wall of the pen and by doing so caused the wall to collapse. In that case, the owner is completely blameless and therefore exempt from liability for any damage that ensues.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">did not tunnel </span>under the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would the owner be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the pen had <span class="gemarra-regular">a stable wall, </span>then even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">did not tunnel, why </span>is the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? What should he have done? </span>Clearly, he cannot be held liable for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the pen had <span class="gemarra-regular">an unstable wall. </span>The Gemara asks: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tunneled </span>under the wall and knocked it down, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The damage in this case is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who said </span>that in any case of damage that is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately by accident, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability, since the ultimate cause of the damage was not his fault. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that in any case of damage that is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as even without the accident his negligence could have caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concerns a stable wall, and even </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">did not tunnel </span>under the wall the owner is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba was stated, it was stated with regard to the latter clause </span>of the mishna that says: If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the su</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or conveyed it to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, and </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and caused damage, </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Concerning this <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba stated: And </span>the owner is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tunneled </span>its way out under the wall of the pen.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>for the mishna to mention the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the animal did not tunnel </span>its way out. In that case the owner is clearly liable, since <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>incident occurred due to his <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence</span> of leaving the animal in the sun, thereby causing it distress and leading it to attempt escape by any possible means. <span class="gemarra-regular">But even if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tunneled </span>its way out, the owner is liable, and this is the novelty in this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>a case of damage that is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident, </span>because animals do not typically tunnel their way out of a pen, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>it is considered as though <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>damage resulted from the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the owner is liable? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one who suffered the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the sheep: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have known that since you left it in the sun, it would utilize any means [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tatzdeka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> available for it to use and </span>it would <span class="gemarra-regular">escape, </span>so you are ultimately responsible for the damage.
§ The mishna teaches: If the <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">out, the bandits are liable. </span>

Daf 56b

The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">once they removed </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">in their custody for all purposes, </span>including responsibility for any ensuing damage.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they stood before </span>the animal and encouraged it to leave the enclosure but did not lead it out directly. This case is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the case in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stands another’s anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> near </span>a third <span class="gemarra-regular">person’s standing </span>grain, and the animal eats the grain, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>the animal there, isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he is liable? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">stood before the animal </span>and encouraged it to go toward the grain without leading it, and he is nevertheless liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: You told us </span>when explaining the statement of Rav Mattana in the name of Rav that it is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he hit </span>the animal with a stick, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, the mishna can <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be explained as referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits hit i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with a stick and did not lead it.
§ The mishna teaches that if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to a shepherd </span>to care for it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the shepherd enters </span>in his place and is responsible for all damage. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in clarification: The shepherd enters <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of whom? If we say </span>that the shepherd is <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of the owner of the animal, </span>didn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn on one occasion </span>in a mishna (44b): If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee, or to a borrower, to a paid bailee, or to a renter, they all enter </span>into the responsibilities and liabilities <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of the owner. </span>What novelty is there in stating that the responsibility now lies with the shepherd to whom the owner conveyed the animal? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> it means that the shepherd enters <span class="gemarra-regular">in place of a bailee </span>to whom the owner conveyed the animal, who is no longer liable once he conveys the animal to a shepherd.
The Gemara asks: If so, this mishna indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first bailee exempts himself completely </span>by conveying the sheep to a shepherd, the second bailee, and he bears no further responsibility. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say that </span>mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, as Rava says: A bailee who conveyed </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee </span>nevertheless remains <span class="gemarra-regular">liable?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the mishna mean when it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">He conveyed it to a shepherd? </span>It is referring to a shepherd who conveyed the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the shepherd’s <span class="gemarra-regular">assistant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is </span>the typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a shepherd to convey </span>animals in his charge <span class="gemarra-regular">to his assistant. </span>Therefore, anyone who gives his animal to a shepherd understands that the shepherd’s assistant may also care for the animal, and it is not a violation of the terms of his assignment for the shepherd to convey it to his assistant. Consequently, this mishna does not refute Rava’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>the same answer in a similar manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case using the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">He conveyed it to a shepherd, and does not teach </span>it using the less specific expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">He conveyed it to another, conclude from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>it means by: <span class="gemarra-regular">He conveyed it to a shepherd, </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the shepherd conveyed it to his assistant, as it is the </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of a shepherd to convey </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to his assistant. But </span>if the shepherd conveyed it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>to care for it in his place, the mishna does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule that the other person enters in his place.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the wording of the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">supports Rava’s </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava says: A bailee who conveyed </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">baile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> remains <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in rejection of that suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>one cannot infer from the wording of the mishna that it is referring specifically to a shepherd conveying the animal to his assistant, since <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps it teaches the matter in the manner in which it </span>typically occurs, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the same is true </span>even if the shepherd conveyed the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to another. </span>Therefore, no support can be brought from here for Rava’s opinion.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that there is a dispute between <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> concerning the following issue: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is safeguarding a lost item</span> that he has not yet returned, what level of responsibility does he bear? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>He is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like an unpaid bailee, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>He is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee.</span>
Their respective opinions are explained: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that he is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like an unpaid bailee </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">what benefit comes to him </span>through safeguarding it? Therefore, he is just like any unpaid bailee. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that he is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on account of the benefit that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not required to giv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a poor person </span>while looking after the lost item, since one who is engaged in one mitzva is exempt from performing another. Consequently, since there is some benefit involved in looking after the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee.</span>
This is one interpretation, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who explain like this: Rav Yosef said </span>that he is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Once the Merciful One obligates him against his will </span>to look after lost items, the Torah presumably imposes the high standard of safeguarding on him. Therefore, he is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee.</span>
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> and difficulties to be discussed: <span class="gemarra-regular">He returned it, always, returned, Ḥiyya, you say, breaks, payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>from that which is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 57a

If one found a lost item and <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned it to a place where </span>its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will see it, he is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">responsible to deal with it. </span>If the item <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen or lost, </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate for the loss.
Rav Yosef states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>meant <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was stolen or lost? </span>Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen from </span>the finder’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house or lost from his house </span>before he returned it? Since he is liable for theft or loss, it appears that he has the same status as a paid bailee.
Rabba rejects this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that it was stolen or lost <span class="gemarra-regular">from the place where </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it, </span>in which case even an unpaid bailee is liable on the grounds of negligence.
Rav Yosef challenges Rabba’s response: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">responsible to deal with it, </span>indicating that failing to deal with it is not negligence, and the finder has no further responsibility for it.
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With what are we dealing here, </span>at the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where it teaches that the finder is liable? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he returned it at midday, </span>which is a time when the owner of the lost item is not typically present. Therefore, the finder has not returned the item properly, and if it is then stolen or lost, he bears responsibility even if he is an unpaid bailee.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching two </span>separate <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is teaching: </span>If the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it in the morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when people are typically present, <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where </span>the owner of the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">will see it, and </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">typically enters and exits and </span>it is likely that <span class="gemarra-regular">he will see it, </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">responsible to deal with it, </span>nor does he bear responsibility if it is then stolen or lost. By contrast, if the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it at midday </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will see it, since </span>it is a time when the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not typically enter and exit and will not see it, if it is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen or lost </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>for the loss.
Rav Yosef again <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rabba from that which is taught in the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The finder of the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">always</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bears responsibility </span>if the item is stolen or lost <span class="gemarra-regular">until he returns it to </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property. What </span>does the word <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>add? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not </span>teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the lost item was stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the finder’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is liable? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>this that one who finds a lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee.</span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yosef in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">I concede to you in </span>a case of one looking after lost <span class="gemarra-regular">animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that he is liable if they are stolen or lost. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that since </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken </span>to the habit of <span class="gemarra-regular">walking ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of their usual path and not behaving in their typical manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">they require extra safeguarding,</span> corresponding to that required of a paid bailee. But with regard to other items that are lost, those that do not move by themselves, the finder bears no greater responsibility to secure them than does an unpaid bailee.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef: </span>The verse states in the context of returning lost items: “Return them” (Deuteronomy 22:1), repeating the verb “<span class="it-text">hashev</span> <span class="it-text">teshivem</span>.” The Sages expounded as follows: From the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hashev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that one may return the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to the house </span>of the owner of the lost article. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do I derive that even if one returns it <span class="gemarra-regular">to his garden or to his ruin, </span>i.e., an unused structure on his property, he has discharged his obligation and is no longer responsible for the item that he found? For this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Teshivem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>repeating the verb for emphasis, to teach that he fulfills the mitzva by returning the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to any place </span>belonging to the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">To his garden or to his ruin? If we say </span>that the finder returned the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">garden </span>of the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">that is secured, </span>i.e., properly enclosed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or to his ruin that is secured, </span>it would be unnecessary to state this, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">his house, </span>since these spaces are secured in the same way as his house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that it means that he returned them <span class="gemarra-regular">to his garden that is not secured</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to his ruin that is not secured, </span>and nevertheless, the finder is no longer liable for subsequent damage or theft of the found item. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that a finder <span class="gemarra-regular">is like an unpaid bailee </span>in terms of his liabilities, and this reduced level of safeguarding when returning the item is sufficient.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Actually, </span>one can explain that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the finder placed it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">garden that is secured, or his ruin that is secured; and </span>with regard to that which poses a <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty to you, </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">his house, </span>there is nevertheless a novelty in this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not require the owner’s knowledge </span>that the article has been returned, and this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Elazar says: All </span>those who are obligated to return items to their owners, e.g., a bailee or a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner’s knowledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that they are returning it <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span>for one fulfilling the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning a lost item. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Torah included many </span>permitted ways of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning </span>lost items by employing the double expression “<span class="it-text">hashev</span> <span class="it-text">teshivem</span>,” which serves to permit the return of the lost item without the knowledge of the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: And you, do you not hold that one safeguarding a lost ite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like an unpaid bailee? But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to one who finds <span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item </span>but falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the item from him and takes an oath to that effect, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a double payment, </span>i.e., twice the value of the item. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that the finder of a lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to have the same status as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> paid bailee, why </span>in such a case must he <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a double payment? He </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be required to pay </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal, </span>since a paid bailee is liable in any event if the article is stolen or lost, and he did not stand to benefit from the claim that the item was stolen.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With what are we dealing here? </span>It is with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the finder took a false oath <span class="gemarra-regular">stating the claim </span>that the deposit was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and in such a case even a paid bailee is exempt. Consequently, his claim would have absolved him from liability, and if the item is subsequently found in his possession, he is liable to pay double for his false claim that it was stolen.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit </span>has the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>and not of a thief, so according to this explanation, why did Rabbi Yoḥanan state that it was stolen by a thief?
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The reason that only a thief pays the double payment and not a robber is that a thief denigrates God by exhibiting fear of people by stealing surreptitiously while not exhibiting fear of Heaven. This is in contrast to a robber, who robs openly. Accordingly, the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that I say that an armed bandit is </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">since he hides from people </span>rather than stealing openly. Although he in fact does steal openly, since he does so by employing a weapon he also exhibits fear of people, and is akin to a thief. Therefore, armed bandits are liable to pay a double payment as is a thief, and a claim that the deposit was seized by armed bandits is considered to be the same as a claim that it was stolen by thieves. Consequently, since a paid bailee is absolved by means of such a claim, if it is determined that his claim was false he must pay double.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rav Yosef from that which is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 57b

<span class="gemarra-regular">No, if you sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an unpaid bailee, who pays a double payment, shall you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> that this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a paid bailee, who does not pay a double payment?</span>
Abaye states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit is </span>considered like <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, it turns out </span>that there is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a paid bailee pays a double payment, </span>and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">when he states the claim that </span>the deposit was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit.</span>
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: No, if you say </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an unpaid bailee, who pays a double payment for any clai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that he makes concerning the theft of the item if he is subsequently found to be lying, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who pays a double payment </span>for a false claim <span class="gemarra-regular">only when he states the claim that </span>the deposit was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit.</span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion of Rav Yosef from that which is taught in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah states with regard to a case where one borrows an object or an animal from another: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it breaks or dies, </span>he shall pay restitution [<span class="it-text">shalem</span> <span class="it-text">yeshalem</span>]” (Exodus 22:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that the borrower is liable in a case where the object or animal <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks or dies; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that he is also liable if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen or lost? You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>the following <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a paid bailee, whom </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered exempt </span>in a case where the item <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks or dies, </span>is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft or loss, </span>then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a borrower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even if the item <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks or dies, is not it logical that he is liable for theft or loss? And this is an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no refutation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit </span>is considered like <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is this an argument that has <span class="gemarra-regular">no refutation? It can be refuted </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about a paid bailee? </span>He is notable in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double </span><span class="gemarra-regular">payment if he states the claim that </span>the deposit was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit, </span>whereas a borrower does not pay double in such a case, but only the principal amount.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the requirement of a borrower to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal without </span>having the option to exempt himself by <span class="gemarra-regular">taking an oath is stricter than </span>the requirement of a paid bailee to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment </span>when claiming that it was stolen by an armed bandit, as this obligation is in effect only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he took <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>Therefore, this doubled payment pertaining to a paid bailee cannot be used as a refutation of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rav Yosef’s opinion: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who rents a cow from another and it is stolen, and this </span>renter <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I will pay </span>for it <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not taking an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that the cow was stolen, since I do not wish to take an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward the thief is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found, </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the double payment to the renter </span>and not to the owner.
The Gemara notes: The Sages who sought to use that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to support Rav Yosef’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A renter is like a paid bailee </span>and is liable for theft or loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">but from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches: And he said: I will pay </span>for it <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not taking an oath </span>that the cow was stolen, one can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that if </span>the renter <span class="gemarra-regular">wants, he can exempt himself</span> from payment <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>Is it not a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the renter <span class="gemarra-regular">states a claim </span>that the item was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit, </span>in which case, as a paid bailee, he does not bear liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>despite this, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward the thief was found, </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the double payment to the renter. Conclude from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is considered like <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span> in rejection of this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee? Perhaps </span>this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like an unpaid bailee, </span>and on account of that he is absolved of responsibility even if he claimed it was a regular theft.
Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to an unarmed bandit and is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh, who reversed </span>the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">and teaches </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does a renter pay? Rabbi Meir says </span>he has the same liability <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a paid bailee, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>he has the same liability <span class="gemarra-regular">as an unpaid bailee. </span>Therefore, even if this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it does not provide support for Rav Yosef’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>Even without reversing the opinions, it is possible to explain that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not provide support for Rav Yosef’s opinion by saying as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case where the renter <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim that </span>the deposit was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit, </span>and so he could have absolved himself by taking an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">it is found that it was </span>stolen by <span class="gemarra-regular">an unarmed bandit. </span>On account of this, the bandit pays the double payment to the renter. No conclusive proof is brought as to whether one who found a lost item has the status of a paid or unpaid bailee.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into a garden and derives benefit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">derives.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the vegetables softened the impact of <span class="gemarra-regular">strikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the ground, and the owner pays for this benefit of the animal being saved from injury.
The Gemara comments: This statement of Rav indicates that the owner pays only for what occurred while the animal landed, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>the animal then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from the garden, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>required to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derives. Shall we say that Rav </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning? As Rav says </span>that in a case where one placed his produce in the courtyard of another without permission, and an animal belonging to the owner of the courtyard ate the produce and was sickened thereby, the owner of the produce is not liable, as he can claim: The animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>it. Similarly, here the owner of the animal can say: This animal fell through no fault of mine, and so it is not my fault that it ate.
The Sages of the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span>One could <span class="gemarra-regular">say that Rav said there </span>that the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten </span>the produce. This claim is relevant <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">itself was injured </span>by eating another’s produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the owner of the produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can say: I will not pay, </span>because the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not have eaten. </span>This is a claim to exempt the owner of the produce from paying the owner of the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Did </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage to another’s </span>produce, the owner can <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">from paying </span>the owner of the produce by stating this claim?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>

Daf 58a

one cannot make such an inference from Rav’s statement. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary,</span> and this is how to understand his statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to state that if the animal fell into the garden and <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from its produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">derives. But </span>if the produce softened the blow of <span class="gemarra-regular">striking</span> the ground and thereby the animal avoided injury, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the owner of the animal should not pay, on the grounds that the owner of the garden may be viewed, analogously, to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">repels a lio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from another’s property. </span>In such a case, although the latter benefited from his action, he is not obligated to pay for it. Similarly in this case, one might think that the owner of the animal does <span class="gemarra-regular">not pay even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">derived. </span>For this reason Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the owner of the animal must pay for this benefit as well.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is indeed </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and the owner of the animal should be exempt for paying for the benefit of his animal not being injured?
The Gemara answers: One who <span class="gemarra-regular">repels a lion from another’s property </span>does so <span class="gemarra-regular">with intent, </span>knowing that he would be ineligible for payment. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner of the garden did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>act <span class="gemarra-regular">with intent </span>and would have preferred for the incident not to have happened. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one could say that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">repels a lion from another’s property does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">have any loss </span>himself. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner of the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">has a loss, </span>in that his produce is damaged.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In which case does this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apply? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says: It slipped on its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">urine. Rava says: Another </span>animal belonging to the same owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed it, </span>causing it to fall there.
The Gemara explains: Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says that </span>the mishna is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed it, </span>in which case the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and is exempt from paying for the damage caused, holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it slipped on its urine, </span>which is beyond the owner’s control. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>Rav Kahana, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">slipped on its urine, </span>holds that if, <span class="gemarra-regular">however, another </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed it, </span>this indicates that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">was negligent </span>and should have prevented this happening. Therefore, in such a case, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>his animal <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged, since </span>the owner of the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the owner of the animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have led </span>your animals <span class="gemarra-regular">across one by one, </span>so that they would not be able to push each other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says: They taught only </span>that the owner pays for the benefit that it derives <span class="gemarra-regular">in the same garden bed </span>into which it fell, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it went <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">garden bed to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">garden be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and ate from that one, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even </span>if the animal goes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">garden bed to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">garden be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and eats, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even </span>if the animal continues going from one bed to another and eating for <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day,</span> the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and not for what it damaged, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it leaves </span>the garden entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">and returns with </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said, </span>explaining Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say </span>this means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Unless </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves with </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge and returns with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge; rather, once it leaves </span>the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if it returned without </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge, </span>the owner is liable to pay for what it damaged. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of the garden can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to</span> the owner of the animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that the garden is there with food to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">every time it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strays it will run to there.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>into the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">in its usual manner and caused damage </span>there, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged. Rabbi Yirmeya asks: </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">descended in its usual manner and </span>gave birth to a calf there and <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">with amniotic fluid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does the owner of the animal have to pay for this damage?
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Yirmeya’s question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>in a case of damage that is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident, </span>since in this case the owner was negligent in allowing the animal to enter another person’s courtyard, although the actual causing of the damage was ultimately by accident. <span class="gemarra-regular">When should you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raise this dilemma? </span>Raise it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one who says </span>that one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>in a case that is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case?
The two sides of the question are as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say</span> that, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>this case is <span class="gemarra-regular">initially through negligence and ultimately by accident, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps here, </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is entirely </span>due to his <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence; since he saw that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was close</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to giving birth, he should have safeguarded it </span>adequately

Daf 58b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and taken care of it, </span>and he bears responsibility for failing to do so. The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does </span>the court appraise the value of the damage when the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged? </span>The court appraises a large piece of land with an area required for sowing one se’a of seed [<span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>] in that field, including the garden bed in which the damage took place, it appraises how much it was worth before the animal damaged it and how much is it worth now, and the owner must pay the difference. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “And it feed in another field [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvi’er</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bisde</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">aḥer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 22:4). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to another field, </span>i.e., relative to the damaged field as a whole and not an appraisal of only the specific garden bed that was damaged.
The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Uvi’er</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bisde</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">aḥer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>can be understood as meaning: “And it feed in another’s field,” and accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to teach that the owner is not liable unless it was a field with an owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>damage caused by an animal in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain,</span> for which the owner is not liable.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if this was the sole intention of the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it feed in a field belonging to another [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvi’er</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bisde</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaveiro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or alternatively, </span>let it write: And it consume <span class="gemarra-regular">another field [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sedeh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">aḥer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].” What </span>is conveyed by the particular expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In another field [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bisde</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">aḥer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? </span>It is to teach that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises </span>the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to another field.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entirely for this </span>purpose, i.e., to teach that the court appraises the damage relative to another field? And in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive the <span class="gemarra-regular">exclusion </span>of liability for damage by Eating in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the verse was referring solely to the method of appraising the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One should have written this </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in the context of payment, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">His best-quality field and the best quality of his vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall pay in another field </span>(see Exodus 22:4), thereby adding the term: In another field, and, by extension, the directive concerning how the damage is appraised, to the verse discussing payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One to write it in </span>the context of the act of damaging, in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it feed </span>in another field”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude two </span>conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from it:</span> The verse is referring to both the place where the damage occurred and the method by which the damage is appraised.
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How do we, </span>the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">appraise </span>the value of the damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: </span>The court appraises the value of an area required for sowing one <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of seed [<span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area required for sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of seed, and according to this calculation determines the value of the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai says: </span>The court appraises each <span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> equivalent to half a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarkav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Ḥizkiyya says: </span>The court appraises the value of each <span class="gemarra-regular">stalk </span>eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to sixty stalks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>compensation according to <span class="gemarra-regular">their value, </span>i.e., the value of the actual damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">view it as if it were a small garden bed and evaluate it </span>accordingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that this means that the court evaluates that garden bed according to what it would cost if sold <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>which contradicts all the previous explanations?
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that the court appraises the value <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>relation to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>When appraising the damage, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>it based on an area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because </span>doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">enhances his </span>position, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they also do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>appraise it relative to an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>equivalent to the area in which one can plant thirty <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of seed, <span class="gemarra-regular">because this weakens his </span>position.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? Rav Pappa said: This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>the value of one <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> relative to </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which, being too large for an individual but too small for a trader, is always sold in the market at a lower price, <span class="gemarra-regular">because that </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">enhance </span>the position of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage. </span>Conversely, the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>appraise the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> relative to </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an area so large that it is purchased only by a person with a specific need and therefore for a high price, <span class="gemarra-regular">because that </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">weaken </span>the position of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one liable for damage.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ objects to this: </span>According to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>term employed by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they also <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>appraise it relative to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is imprecise. According to the explanation of Rav Pappa, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said: And </span>they also <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>appraise it relative to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>to parallel the term in the previous clause: A <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by itself, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because that </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">enhance </span>the position of <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>does the court appraise <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> as one part of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because that </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">weaken </span>the position of <span class="gemarra-regular">the injured </span>party, since damage inside such a large area is insignificant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court appraises the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>relation to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater than the area that was damaged.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who cut down a date palm [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kashba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to another. </span>The latter <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span> with the perpetrator for arbitration <span class="gemarra-regular">before the Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Exilarch <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the perpetrator: <span class="gemarra-regular">I personally saw </span>that place where the date palm was planted, and it actually contained <span class="gemarra-regular">three date palms [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">talata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cluster,</span> growing out of a single root, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they were worth </span>altogether <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars. </span>Consequently, since you, the perpetrator, cut down one of the three, <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give him thirty-three and one-third </span>dinars, one third of the total value. The perpetrator rejected this ruling and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Why do I </span>need to be judged by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch, who rules according to Persian law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He came before Rav Naḥman </span>for judgment in the same case, who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span> The court appraises the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>relation to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater than the damage caused. This amount is much less than thirty-three and one-third dinars.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the court appraises <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by one’s property,</span> such as his animal, relative to an area sixty times greater, <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>they also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the court appraises damage relative to an area sixty times greater even <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: With regard to damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is your opinion? </span>Are you basing your opinion on the following, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">destroys the vineyard of another </span>while the grapes are <span class="gemarra-regular">budding [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">semadar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views how much </span>the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth before </span>he destroyed it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much it is worth afterward. </span>Abaye states the inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas, </span>the method of appraising one part in <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty is not taught. </span>Is the basis of your ruling the fact that in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses damage caused directly by a person, the method of appraising one part in sixty is not mentioned?
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animal it is not taught </span>in a mishna or <span class="it-text">baraita</span> without mentioning the method of appraising one part in sixty <span class="gemarra-regular">like this case? </span>But this is not so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">broke down a sapling </span>that had not yet borne fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Those who issue decrees in Jerusale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the damages are determined based on a fixed formula: If the <span class="gemarra-regular">sapling </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in its first year, </span>the owner of the animal pays <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>pieces of <span class="gemarra-regular">silver; </span>if the sapling was <span class="gemarra-regular">two years old,</span> he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>pieces of <span class="gemarra-regular">silver. </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate unripe blades of grain </span>used for pasture, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is judged according to what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remains of it, </span>i.e., the court waits until the rest of the field ripens and then appraises the value of what was previously eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views how much </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth </span>before he destroyed it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much it is worth </span>now. 

Daf 59a

If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the grapes while they were in the <span class="gemarra-regular">budding </span>stage, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the grapes that were damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">as if they were grape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about to be picked, </span>and appraise the damage based on this. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views how much </span>the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth </span>before the animal ate the grapes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much it is worth </span>now. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that the court appraises the vineyard or group of trees that were damaged, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate young branches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lulevei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gefanim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of vines or shoots of fig </span>trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it ate unripe figs or unripe grapes, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views them </span>and appraises them <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes ready to be picked.</span>
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, it teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views how much </span>the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth </span>before the animal ate the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much it is worth </span>now, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>that the court appraises the damage relative to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say? </span>You must say that the wording employed by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to be understood to mean that the court appraises the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater, so <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> dealing with one who himself causes damage, the wording is to be understood to mean that the damage is valued <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Yishmael </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">said the same thing. </span>They are of the same opinion that the appraisal for damages is based on the value of the produce remaining in the field once it ripens.
The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this that we stated </span>above in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, i.e., that the damages paid for an animal eating unripe grain is assessed according to what remains of the grain.
The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay” </span>(Exodus 22:4), which means he must pay according to the <span class="gemarra-regular">best</span>-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">field of the injured </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">or the best</span>-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard of the injured </span>party. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: The verse comes only </span>to allow <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>parties <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>land of the one liable to pay for the damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference it is derived that this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to consecrated </span>property. Compensation for damaging consecrated property is paid from one’s best-quality assets.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And do not say </span>that Rabbi Yishmael’s statement should be interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin says: </span>Here it concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the produce of <span class="gemarra-regular">one garden bed from among </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">garden beds, but we do not know whether </span>the garden bed it ate from <span class="gemarra-regular">was lean or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">choice. Therefore, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the owner of the animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">Arise </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">pay choice </span>land, equivalent <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the best</span>-quality land <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is now </span>remaining, and the court does not assume that the animal ate produce from the lesser-quality garden bed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we do not say this.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that Rabbi Yishmael does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rav Idi bar Avin? It is because he accepts the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant; </span>without such proof, the owner of the animal pays only the value of a lesser-quality garden bed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yishmael interprets the Torah’s expression “the best of his field” as requiring payment <span class="gemarra-regular">with the best</span>-quality land <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, and what is this? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>remained in the field and subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">sprouted, </span>and the compensation is based on the value of this.
The Gemara examines the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: In what</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that the court appraises the vineyard or group of trees that were damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate young branches of vines or shoots of fig </span>trees. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>indicates that if the animal ate <span class="gemarra-regular">budding </span>grapes the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views them </span>and appraises them <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes ready to be picked. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>and try to explain accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate unripe figs or half-ripe grapes, that is </span>where the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views them as if </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes ready to be picked, </span>indicating that if the animal ate the grapes in the <span class="gemarra-regular">budding </span>stage, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views how much </span>the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth </span>before the animal ate them <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much it is worth </span>now. Therefore, the two clauses of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> appear to be contradictory.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bind </span>them together <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach </span>them as a single statement, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said </span>that the court appraises how much the field was worth when the animal ate from it? It is said in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate young branches of vines or shoots of fig trees. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>grapes in the <span class="gemarra-regular">budding </span>stage, <span class="gemarra-regular">unripe figs, or half-ripe grapes, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views them </span>and appraises them <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes ready to be picked.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua</span> with regard to grapes in the budding stage. Why would the mishna state their opinions separately?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the weakening of the vine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A vine is weakened by the grapes growing on it, as they draw nutrients from the roots and branches. Now that the grapes have been eaten, the vine is no longer weakened. Therefore, according to one opinion, the court takes into consideration this reduction of the weakening of the vine, and that amount is deducted when calculating the damages, whereas according to the other opinion, the court does not take this into account. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>their respective opinions are <span class="gemarra-regular">not defined, </span>and it is not clear which <span class="it-text">tanna</span> takes this weakening into account and which does not.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Their respective opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">are certainly defined, </span>and it is possible to know which Sage held which opinion, since <span class="gemarra-regular">who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">is concerned for the weakening of the vine? It is Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya: </span>With regard to the indemnity payments that <span class="gemarra-regular">a rapis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> must pay his victim, who had been a virgin, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the pain </span>caused by the rape. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">she will ultimately suffer </span>the same pain during her first act of sexual intercourse <span class="gemarra-regular">with her husband </span>when she marries. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The pain of a woman who <span class="gemarra-regular">has intercourse willingly is not comparabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the pain of a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who has intercourse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by rape. </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda considers future pain when considering payment of damages, and similarly, he considers the reduced weakening of the vine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: These </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> following <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said the same thing </span>concerning this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that we said </span>with regard to the case of rape and the case of the vine. As to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the case about which they gave a similar ruling?
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of one who injured a pregnant woman, thereby causing her to miscarry, for which the Torah holds him liable to pay her husband compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>The court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring and <span class="gemarra-regular">deducts </span>the amount they would have paid for <span class="gemarra-regular">a midwife. </span>Since she miscarried, the husband no longer has to pay for a midwife, so that is deducted from the compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">deducts </span>the value of the extra <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance </span>the husband would have been required to provide for his pregnant wife.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that the court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>the amount they would have paid for <span class="gemarra-regular">a midwife</span> would <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>concede that the appraisal is <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>the value of the extra <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance. But the one who says </span>that the appraisal is <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>the value of the extra <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>necessarily hold that the court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span>the money they would have paid for <span class="gemarra-regular">a midwife, since </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the assailant: <span class="gemarra-regular">My wife is capabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and does not require a midwife</span> to assist her when giving birth.
Returning to the discussion of the appraisal of compensation for damage, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, acted in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman </span>and appraised a damaged date palm <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times greater than the particular area where the tree was standing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A different version </span>of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is also stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, appraised </span>the damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a date palm relative to </span>the assessment of <span class="gemarra-regular">the patch of land </span>where the tree stood, i.e., how much it was worth with the tree and how much it was worth without it.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, with regard to an Aramean date palm, </span>i.e., one of lesser quality, and it is assessed relative to the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Exilarch with regard to a Persian date palm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are of higher quality and each one is valuable, and it is not assessed relative to the land.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer Ze’eira</span>

Daf 59b

<span class="gemarra-regular">was wearing black shoes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> unlike the Jewish custom of that time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and standing in the market of Neharde’a. </span>Officials <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of the Exilarch found him and said to him: What is different </span>about you that causes you to wear <span class="gemarra-regular">these shoes? He said to them: </span>I am wearing them <span class="gemarra-regular">because I am in mourning over </span>the destruction of the Temple and <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and so I wear black shoes, as is the custom of mourners. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Are you </span>a man of such <span class="gemarra-regular">importance to </span>publicly <span class="gemarra-regular">mourn over Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> They thought that it was </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptuousness </span>on his part. Since he was acting against the prevalent Jewish custom, <span class="gemarra-regular">they brought him </span>to the prison <span class="gemarra-regular">and incarcerated him.</span>
Eliezer Ze’eira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I am a great man, </span>a scholar, and it is fitting for me to mourn publicly over the destruction of Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: How do we know </span>that you are a scholar? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Either you ask of me a matter </span>of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and I will answer you, <span class="gemarra-regular">or I will ask you a matter </span>of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and you will answer me. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: You ask.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who cuts </span>a cluster of flowers on <span class="gemarra-regular">the stem </span>of a date palm belonging to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is he required to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay? They said to him: He pays the value of the </span>date <span class="gemarra-regular">stem. </span>He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">they will become </span>ripe <span class="gemarra-regular">dates, </span>which are worth more. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the value of </span>the future <span class="gemarra-regular">dates. He said to them: But he did not take </span>ripe <span class="gemarra-regular">dates from </span>the other person, so how can the court obligate him to pay for damage that he did not cause?
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span>Eliezer Ze’eira: <span class="gemarra-regular">You tell us </span>the correct appraisal for the date stem. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them:</span> The court appraises the damage relative to a similar piece of land <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty </span>times the size. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Who says </span>an opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as you </span>do, so that you can prove you are correct? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Shmuel is alive and his court exists; </span>you can ask him. <span class="gemarra-regular">They sent </span>the question <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel, </span>together with the ruling of Eliezer Ze’eira. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: He is saying well to you, </span>because the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as he says; the appraisal is <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty</span> times greater. Upon hearing this, the officials of the Exilarch realized that he was a great man <span class="gemarra-regular">and they released him.</span>
§ The mishna (55b) teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>If the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate ripe produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner pays the value of the ripe produce eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">This that the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it feed in another’s field” </span>(Exodus 22:4), which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises</span> the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">relative to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">field, this statement </span>applies specifically with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">requires a field </span>to grow. For one’s animal eating this <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, which do not require the field </span>in order to ripen further, the animal’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay </span>their value <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: Rav judged </span>a practical <span class="it-text">halakha</span> on a certain issue <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>despite the fact that in general the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he rule</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>even though in that case his was a minority opinion.
Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav judged </span>a practical <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of a field designated by its owner as a lien for his wife’s marriage contract, which he subsequently wants to sell, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he wrote </span>a document of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">to a first </span>buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">did not sig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him</span> to endorse the sale, and subsequently the husband wrote a document of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">to a second </span>buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">signed for him, she </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">loses </span>the lien of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract, </span>since the sale is effective and she can no longer collect from this field; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she can say: I did </span>it only to <span class="gemarra-regular">please my husband, </span>but I did not mean it and never intended to forgo my rights. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">do you, </span>the purchasers, <span class="gemarra-regular">have against me? </span>Therefore, the lien is still in effect. Rav judged a case in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</span> in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>If one’s animal <span class="gemarra-regular">ate ripe produce, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">ripe produce </span>eaten. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span> it ate <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of produce, he pays the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of produce, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it ate <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he pays for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is the minority one, Rav ruled in accordance with it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stacks </span>his produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in another’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">without permission </span>from the owner of that field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an animal belonging to the owner of the field eats </span>the produce, the owner of the field is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. And if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is injured by </span>the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the stack </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But if he stacked </span>them in that field <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the field </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for damage caused to the produce.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>the mishna were <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t he say: </span>A homeowner who gives another permission to bring items into his courtyard is not responsible for them <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the homeowner accepts on himself to safeguard </span>them? The mishna does not mention any such acceptance of responsibility. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Here we are dealing with the supervisor of the threshing floors, </span>to whom people would entrust their produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, since the supervisor says</span> to the owner of the produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in and stack</span> it, it is as though he had said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in and I will supervise </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for you.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sends a fire, </span>i.e., places a burning object, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hand of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deaf-mute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, or a minor </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>for any damage later caused by the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he sent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hand of a </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent </span>person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>not the one who sent him.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one </span>other person subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the wood, </span>causing the fire to spread, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who brought the woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for any damage caused. Conversely, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person first <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the wood, and</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other person <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the fire, the one who brought the fire </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since it was he who actually kindled the wood.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">another came and fanned </span>the flame, and as a result the fire spread and caused damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who fanned it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since he is the proximate cause of the damage. If <span class="gemarra-regular">the wind fanned </span>the flames, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the people involved are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since none of them actually caused the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught </span>that one who sends fire in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">only when he conveyed to him </span>a glowing <span class="gemarra-regular">coa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one of these people <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned </span>it himself and set it alight. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">conveyed a torch to </span>a deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor, the one who gave it to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The action </span>of the one who gave it to him directly <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the fire to spread.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he conveyed a torch to him, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason? </span>It is the <span class="gemarra-regular">tong</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the deaf-mute that caused </span>the damage, since torches do not cause fires on their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the one who gives dangerous objects to a deaf-mute is <span class="gemarra-regular">not rendered liable </span>for the damage caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he conveys branches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gavza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him</span>

Daf 60a

<span class="gemarra-regular">of thin wood </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a candle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheraga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">action, </span>i.e., that of the one who sent the flame, <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely caused</span> the fire to spread.
The mishna teaches that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hand of a </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent </span>person is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable…</span>If another came and fanned the flame the one who fanned it is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says </span>with regard to the correct text of the mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches </span>it using the word <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">libba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is not mistaken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches </span>it using the word <span class="gemarra-regular">blew [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nibba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is not mistaken.</span>
Rav Naḥman explained: The <span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches </span>using the word <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">libba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is not mistaken, as it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “With a flame [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">belabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of fire” </span>(Exodus 3:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches</span> using the word <span class="gemarra-regular">blew [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nibba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is not mistaken, as it is written: “He creates the fruit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">niv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the lips” </span>(Isaiah 57:19), which can be interpreted as referring to the breath of the lips.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the wind fanned </span>the flames, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the people involved <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt,</span> indicating that even if one fanned the fire at the same time that the wind was blowing he is exempt. The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>the same idea explicitly: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one fanned </span>the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at the same time <span class="gemarra-regular">the wind </span>fanned it, <span class="gemarra-regular">if his fanning has </span>sufficient strength by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">to fan </span>the flames, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> for damage caused by the fire, since even without the wind the fire would have spread. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>his fanning alone was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sufficient, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is he exempt if his fanning is not sufficient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it be </span>the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">winnows </span>grain on Shabbat by throwing it into the air, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wind assists him </span>by separating the chaff from the grain. In such a case he is liable for desecrating Shabbat, despite the fact that without the assistance of the wind he would not have been able to winnow the grain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: With what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he fanned </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">from one side and the wind fanned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the other side, </span>and the fire was blown in the direction the wind was blowing. Therefore, it is clear that his fanning did not help the fire spread, so he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he fanned </span>it along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a typical wind, </span>and this was not sufficient to cause the fire to spread, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>suddenly <span class="gemarra-regular">an atypical wind </span>came and <span class="gemarra-regular">fanned it. </span>Therefore, he is exempt since he could not have anticipated this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he only <span class="gemarra-regular">heated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">de</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzamera</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tzamurei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the fire by breathing on it, rather than fanning it properly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: When we say </span>that one is liable in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">winnows and the wind assists him, this statement </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span>With regard to Shabbat, the principle is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Torah prohibited planned, </span>constructive <span class="gemarra-regular">labor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The primary consideration is that his objective is accomplished, even if he did not perform the entire act of labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the context of damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>considered to have caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one who causes <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sends </span>forth <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, </span>i.e., allows it to escape, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it consumes wood, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or earth, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, as it is stated: “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed, the one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation” </span>(Exodus 22:5), which teaches that he is liable also for destroying the field itself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the verse cited in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One </span>to write in the Torah all of these terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Thorns,” “a stack of grain,” “standing grain,” and “field,” </span>which seem to be redundant?
Rava explains: All the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary, because if the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“thorns” </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that it is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">thorns for which the Merciful One renders one liable, because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">fire </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">near them, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is common that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a stack of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grain, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is not common </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">fire </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">near it, </span>as grain is valuable, so one keeps it out of harm’s way, and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not common that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent </span>in allowing it to catch fire, I would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful One had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A stack of grain,” I would say </span>that it is specifically for such <span class="gemarra-regular">a stack </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One renders him liable, because </span>it involves <span class="gemarra-regular">a substantial </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">loss. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">thorns, </span>which involve only <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal loss, </span>I would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable. Therefore, the verse teaches that he is liable for damage to thorns as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the Torah to state the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“standing grain”? </span>It is in order to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as standing grain is exposed, so too, </span>one is liable only for damage caused by fire <span class="gemarra-regular">for all </span>items that are <span class="gemarra-regular">exposed. </span>One is exempt from liability for damage to items that are concealed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for a concealed </span>article damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">by a fire, why do I </span>need the Torah to state the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Standing grain”?</span> The Gemara answers: The term serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">that have stature</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., trees and animals, and not only produce. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of concealed articles from the term “standing grain,” <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do they </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">that have stature </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">included? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They derive it from </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or standing grain,” </span>since the additional word “or” is an inclusive term.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>derive from the additional word “or”? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” to divide </span>the terms, i.e., to teach that one is liable for damage to any one of the items listed, and not only where the fire burned all of them together. The Gemara then asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do the Rabbis </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to divide </span>the terms so that one is liable for damage to each one independently? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They derive it from </span>the second instance of the word “or,” as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or the field.”</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span> derive from the phrase “or the field”? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the Merciful One wrote </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or standing grain,” He </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote: “Or the field,” </span>for stylistic consistency, but no additional <span class="it-text">halakha</span> may be derived from this term.
Rava continues to elaborate on the different terms in the verse: And <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“field” </span>in the verse? It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include</span> liability for damage in a case when the flames <span class="gemarra-regular">licked a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plowed field and charred its stones. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let the Merciful One write </span>only the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“field,” and </span>then it would <span class="gemarra-regular">not require all these </span>other terms. If one is liable for damage to a field, which is not totally destroyed by the fire, he is certainly liable for damage to other items that are completely destroyed. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to write the other terms as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">because if the Merciful One </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“field,” I would say that </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what is in the field, yes, </span>one is liable, but for <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else, no, </span>one is not liable. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that one is liable for any damage caused by fire.
§ The Gemara cites an aggadic midrash based on this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: Calamity befalls the world onl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when wicked </span>people are <span class="gemarra-regular">in the world, but </span>the calamity <span class="gemarra-regular">begins only with the righteous first, as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, </span>so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed” (Exodus 22:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">When does the fire, </span>i.e., calamity, <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge? </span>At a time <span class="gemarra-regular">when the thorns, </span>i.e., the wicked, <span class="gemarra-regular">are found with it. But </span>calamity <span class="gemarra-regular">begins only from the righteous first, as it is stated </span>in the continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And a stack of grain is consumed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vene’ekhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].” It is not stated: </span>If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, <span class="gemarra-regular">and consumes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’akhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the stack of grain; rather, </span>it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A stack of grain is consumed,” </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stack, </span>i.e., the righteous, <span class="gemarra-regular">has already been consumed </span>before the thorns.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written </span>with regard to the plague of the firstborn: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning” </span>(Exodus 12:22)? If the plague was not decreed upon the Jewish people, why were they not permitted to leave their homes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Once permission </span>is granted <span class="gemarra-regular">to the destroyer </span>to kill, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. And not only </span>that, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it begins with the righteous first, as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked” </span>(Ezekiel 21:8), where mention of the righteous precedes the wicked.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef cried </span>and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are all these </span>righteous people <span class="gemarra-regular">also compared to nothing </span>when calamity strikes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: It is goodness for </span>the righteous that they die first, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “The righteous is taken away because of the evil to come” </span>(Isaiah 57:1), so that he will not have to endure the suffering that will befall the people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>

Daf 60b

<span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">always enter </span>an unfamiliar city <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>a time of <span class="gemarra-regular">good, </span>i.e., while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “It is good” with regard to the creation of light (see Genesis 1:4). This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>likewise, when one leaves a city <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">leave at </span>a time of <span class="gemarra-regular">good, </span>meaning after sunrise the next morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning” </span>(Exodus 12:22).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">plague in the city, gather your feet, </span>i.e., limit the time you spend out of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning.” And it says </span>in another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you;</span> hide yourself for a little moment, until the anger has passed by” (Isaiah 26:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in the chambers terror” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:25).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason for citing the additional verses introduced with the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says? </span>The first verse seems sufficient to teach the principle that one should not emerge from one’s house when there is a plague. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter, </span>the first verse that states that none of you shall go out until morning, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">at night, but in the day </span>one may think that the principle does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply, for this reason the Gemara teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: “Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no fear inside, </span>which explains why it is preferable to remain indoors, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where there is fear inside, </span>one might think that <span class="gemarra-regular">when he goes out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sits among people in general company </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">better, </span>therefore, the Gemara introduces the third verse and says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror.” </span>This means that <span class="gemarra-regular">although there is terror in the chambers, outside the sword will bereave, </span>so it is safer to remain indoors.
<span class="gemarra-regular">At a time </span>when there was a <span class="gemarra-regular">plague, Rava would close the windows </span>of his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For death is come up into our windows” </span>(Jeremiah 9:20).
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">famine in the city, spread your feet, </span>i.e., leave the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there” </span>(Genesis 12:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: “If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; </span>and if we sit here, we die also, now come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die” (II Kings 7:4).
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason for citing the second verse, introduced with the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says? And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter, </span>the principle of leaving the city, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no uncertainty </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a life-threatening </span>situation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where there is uncertainty </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a life-threatening </span>situation this principle does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: “Come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; </span>and if they kill us, we shall but die.”
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a plague in the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person should not walk in the middle of the road, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Angel of Death walks in the middle of the road, as, since </span>in Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">they have given him permission </span>to kill within the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">he goes openly </span>in the middle of the road. By contrast, if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">peace </span>and quiet <span class="gemarra-regular">in the city, do not walk on the sides of the road, as, since </span>the Angel of Death <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have permission </span>to kill within the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">he hides </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and walks </span>on the side of the road.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a plague in the city, a person should not enter the synagogue alone, as the Angel of Death leaves his utensils there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and for this reason it is a dangerous place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter, </span>the danger in the synagogue, applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when there are no children learning in </span>the synagogue, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">not ten </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">praying in it. </span>But if there are children learning or ten men praying there, it is not a dangerous place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs </span>in a certain place <span class="gemarra-regular">are crying </span>for no reason, it is a sign that they feel the <span class="gemarra-regular">Angel of Death has come to the city. </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs are playing, </span>it is a sign that they feel that <span class="gemarra-regular">Elijah the prophet has come to the city. These matters </span>apply only <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no female </span>dog among them. If there is a female dog nearby, their crying or playing is likely due to her presence.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ami and Rav Asi sat before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage said to </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Master say </span>words of <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage said to </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Master say </span>words of <span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">began to say </span>words of <span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage did not let him, </span>so he <span class="gemarra-regular">began to say </span>words of <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage did not let him.</span>
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared? </span>It can be compared <span class="gemarra-regular">to a man who has two wives, one young and one old. The young </span>wife <span class="gemarra-regular">pulls out his white </span>hairs, so that her husband will appear younger. <span class="gemarra-regular">The old </span>wife <span class="gemarra-regular">pulls out his black </span>hairs so that he will appear older. And it <span class="gemarra-regular">turns out </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">bald from here and from there, </span>i.e., completely bald, due to the actions of both of his wives.
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa continued and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: If so, I will say to you a matter that is appropriate to both of you, </span>which contains both <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and <span class="it-text">aggada</span>. In the verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns” </span>(Exodus 22:5), the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“breaks out” </span>indicates that it breaks out <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself. </span>Yet, the continuation of the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation,” </span>which indicates that he must pay only if the fire spread due to his negligence. The verse can be explained allegorically: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, said </span>that although the fire broke out in the Temple due to the sins of the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is incumbent upon Me to pay </span>restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">for the fire that I kindled.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">I, </span>God, <span class="gemarra-regular">kindled a fire in Zion, as it is stated: </span>“The Lord has accomplished His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger; <span class="gemarra-regular">and He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations” </span>(Lamentations 4:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">And I will build it with fire </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">future, as it is stated: “For I, </span>says the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">will be for her a wall of fire round about; and I will be the glory in her midst” </span>(Zechariah 2:9).
There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> that can be learned from the verse in Exodus, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse begins with damage </span>caused through one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property: </span>“If a fire breaks out,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and concludes with damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s body: </span>“The one who kindled the fire.” This indicates that when damage is caused by fire, it is considered as though the person who kindled the fire caused the damage directly with his body. That serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to say to you </span>that the liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire </span>damage is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrows. </span>Just as one who shoots an arrow and causes damage is liable because the damage was caused directly through his action, so too, one who kindles a fire that causes damage is liable because it is considered as though the damage were caused directly by his actions.
§ The Gemara continues with another statement of <span class="it-text">aggada</span> on a related topic: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And David longed, and said: Oh, that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, </span>and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord” (II Samuel 23:15–16). The Sages understood that David was not simply asking for water, but was using the term as a metaphor referring to Torah, and he was raising a halakhic dilemma.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the dilemma </span>that David <span class="gemarra-regular">is raising</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: He was asking </span>about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed </span>article damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He wanted to know whether the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that one is liable to pay for such damage, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that one is exempt from liability for damage by fire to concealed articles. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Sages in Bethlehem <span class="gemarra-regular">answered him what they answered him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna stated </span>a different explanation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were stacks of barley belonging to Jews in which the Philistines were hiding, and </span>David wanted to burn down the stacks to kill the Philistines and save his own life. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to save oneself </span>by destroying <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They sent </span>the following answer <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: It is prohibited to save oneself </span>by destroying <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of another. But you are king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a king may breach the fence </span>of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his </span>action, i.e., the normal <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of damage do not apply to you since you are king.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis, and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Mari, </span>give an alternative explanation of the dilemma and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The stacks of barley belonged to Jews, and </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines. </span>David needed barley to feed his animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>David <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? I know that I may take the lentils belonging to a gentile to feed my animals, but is it permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to take a stack of barley </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, to place before one’s animal </span>for it to consume, <span class="gemarra-regular">with the intent to pay </span>the owner of the barley with the <span class="gemarra-regular">stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines?</span>
The Sages of Bethlehem <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the following reply <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: “If the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery, </span>walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die” (Ezekiel 33:15). This verse teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">repays </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item, he </span>is nevertheless considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and is described as such in the verse, and a commoner would not be allowed to act as you asked. <span class="gemarra-regular">But you are king, and a king may breach the fence </span>of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to form a path for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and none may protest his </span>action.
The Gemara discusses the different explanations: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that David was asking whether he could take the stacks of barley and <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange </span>them, i.e., repay the owners of the barley, with stacks of lentils, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is as it is written </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one verse: </span>“And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, <span class="gemarra-regular">where was a plot of ground full of lentils; </span>and the people fled from the Philistines” (II Samuel 23:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">verse: </span>“He was with David at Pas Dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, <span class="gemarra-regular">where was a plot of ground full of barley;</span> and the people fled from before the Philistines” (I Chronicles 11:13). This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by saying that there were two fields, one of barley and one of lentils.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that David’s question was asked because he wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn </span>the stacks of barley, for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">does he require these two verses? </span>How does he explain this contradiction? Rav Huna could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you that there were also stacks of lentils belonging to Jews, inside which the Philistines were hiding.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that David asked his question because he wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn </span>the stacks, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is as it is writ-ten </span>in the following verse with regard to David: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But he stood in the midst of the plot, and saved it, </span>and slew the Philistines; and the Lord performed a great victory” (II Samuel 23:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>that David’s question was asked <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to exchanging </span>the lentils for the barley, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And saved it”?</span>
The Rabbis answer that David saved it in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not permit them to exchange </span>the value of the barley with the lentils.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according to both of <span class="gemarra-regular">these two </span>opinions, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is as it is written </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">verses, </span>one describing the field of lentils and one describing the field of barley. 

Daf 61a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to </span>Rava, who cited Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says</span> that David <span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>article damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose does <span class="gemarra-regular">he require the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">verses </span>that describe a field of lentils and a field of barley? Rav Naḥman could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that David <span class="gemarra-regular">was asking</span> both about <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed </span>articles damaged by a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">and one of these </span>other two dilemmas.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">these two </span>explanations, that David was asking either about repaying barley with lentils or burning the stacks of barley, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is as it is written </span>of David: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But he would not drink it” </span>(II Samuel 23:16). David <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since there is a prohibition </span>involved in this action, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not satisfactory to me </span>to act in this manner, even though technically it is permitted for a king. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that David <span class="gemarra-regular">was raising a dilemma </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a concealed </span>article damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, since they sent him </span>an answer that was <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of: “But <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not drink it”?</span>
The Gemara answers: This means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not say the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in their names. </span>He did not transmit the ruling in the name of those who went in the time of battle to ask the Sages what the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is. David <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is the tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">I received from the court of Samuel of Rama: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who hands himself </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">to die for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">words of Torah, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">do not say a matter of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his name, </span>so that others will not follow this ruling and endanger their lives.
The Gemara asks another question: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He poured it out to the Lord” </span>(II Samuel 23:16), which indicates that David acted stringently and did not rely on the lenient ruling that he received. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>either of <span class="gemarra-regular">these two </span>explanations, that David asked either about burning the stacks of barley or about replacing their value with lentils, he poured out the water to God <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he acted for the sake of Heave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and did not rely on the lenient ruling he had received. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that David asked about <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed </span>article damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, what </span>is the reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">he poured out </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Lord? </span>The Gemara answers: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of the tradition, </span>without associating it with any specific individual.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one kindled a fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that is four cubits high, or </span>if the fire crossed <span class="gemarra-regular">the public thoroughfare, or </span>if the fire crossed <span class="gemarra-regular">a river, </span>and in each case it caused damage on the other side, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed a fence that is four cubits in height, </span>the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>This appears to contradict the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>There is no dispute between the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna and the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>; there is merely a difference of how they stated their rulings. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">counts </span>downward <span class="gemarra-regular">from above to below. </span>In other words, if the fire crossed a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">six cubits </span>high, the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt; </span>if it crossed a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">five cubits </span>high, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt; </span>and this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the fire crosses a fence of a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counts </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">from below to above. </span>The meaning is that if the fire crossed a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits </span>high, the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>if the fire crossed a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">three cubits </span>high, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>and this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the fire crosses a fence of a maximum of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>Accordingly, there is no contradiction between the mishna and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: When they said </span>in the mishna with regard to a fire crossing a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>high <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">even in a field of thorns. Rav Pappa says: And </span>Rava’s statement is referring to a case where the height of the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">is four cubits </span>counting <span class="gemarra-regular">from above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upper <span class="gemarra-regular">limit of the thorns.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>in the mishna that one is exempt from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes high [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekolaḥat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes low [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">benikhpefet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and therefore spreads easily along the ground, the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable even </span>if the space that the fire crossed was <span class="gemarra-regular">up to one hundred cubits. And Shmuel said: The mishna </span>exempts one from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes low,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes high, even any </span>minimal gap between where the fire was kindled and where it caused damage renders the one who kindled the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said </span>that one is exempt if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes high. But in </span>a case where the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes low and there is wood</span> to keep <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>burning, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable even </span>if it causes damage at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">up to one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed a river or a pool [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shelulit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">that is eight cubits wide, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the damage caused, regardless of whether the fire blazed high or low.
§ The mishna teaches: If the fire crossed <span class="gemarra-regular">the public thoroughfare, </span>he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who holds this opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned </span>in a mishna (61b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One is liable up to a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits, like </span>the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain. </span>By inference, one is exempt if a fire crosses a greater distance, i.e., across a public thoroughfare.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>if the fire crossed <span class="gemarra-regular">a river, </span>he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The term stream means <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual river. And Shmuel says: </span>This term means <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel.</span>
The Gemara explains their dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual river, </span>Rav, deems exempt one whose fire crosses a riverbed <span class="gemarra-regular">even when there is no water </span>in it, since it is sufficiently deep and wide to prevent a typical fire from crossing it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the one who says </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel, </span>Shmuel, holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the fire crosses a water channel that <span class="gemarra-regular">has water in it, yes,</span> the one who kindled the fire is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the fire crosses a water channel that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have water in it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Pe’a</span> 2:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">And these, </span>the following list of features, <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>a field <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is no longer considered a single field, but instead <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> must be given from each separate section: <span class="gemarra-regular">A stream, a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shelulit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a private road, and a public thoroughfare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shelulit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where rainwater gathers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sholelin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. Rav Beivai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>says: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel that distributes </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">spoils</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shalal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to its banks, </span>since the water spreads to the adjacent cisterns.
The Gemara points out that according to the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where rainwater gathers, </span>Shmuel, since gathered rainwater divides a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel, </span>which is both larger and permanent, divide a field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water channel </span>divides a field, Rabbi Yoḥanan, he holds that only that divides a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a place where rainwater gathers does not divide </span>the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">since these</span>

Daf 61b

<span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">called pools of the land,</span> and are not considered significant enough to divide the field.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who kindles </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own </span>premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">up to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>distance <span class="gemarra-regular">may the fire travel </span>within his property for him to still bear liability for damage caused? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views his </span>location where he kindled the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it were in the center of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if the fire spreads and causes damage farther away than half a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">kor</span>, the one who kindled the fire is exempt, since he could not anticipate that the fire would spread so far. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One is liable up to a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen cubits, like </span>the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public thoroughfare. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>One is liable up to a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty cubits. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The one who kindled the fire shall pay [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shallem yeshallem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] compensation” </span>(Exodus 22:5), to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">everything is according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Rabbi Shimon appears to hold that there is no maximum distance which would exempt one from liability for the spreading of a fire. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t Rabbi Shimon</span> of the opinion that there is a maximum <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>concerning liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for a fire, </span>beyond which one is exempt?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 20b): <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not stand an ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inside the house unless there is a height of four cubits </span>to the ceiling <span class="gemarra-regular">above it, </span>out of concern that the ceiling might catch fire. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stood it in the attic, </span>he should not do so <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there is plaster [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’aziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> underneath it, </span>above the ceiling of the floor below, <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths </span>in thickness, out of concern that the floor might catch fire. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a stove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is smaller and does not reach temperatures as high as those of an oven, a thickness of one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth</span> is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even though he may place his oven or stove in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the fire from the oven or stove <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he must pay </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what it damaged.</span>
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: These measurements were stated only </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the fire from the oven or stove <span class="gemarra-regular">causes damage </span>after the owner takes these precautions, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying </span>compensation. Evidently, Rabbi Shimon does have a maximum distance beyond which one is not liable for fire.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh says: </span>This is how Rabbi Shimon’s statement in the mishna should be understood: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everything is according to the height of the fir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> he initially kindled. If it was a small fire he is not liable to pay for damage caused by it if it traveled far, whereas if he started a large fire, he is liable even if it traveled a great distance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. And so Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who kindles a stack </span>of wheat or barley <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were vessels </span>concealed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">and they </span>caught fire and <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>together with the stack, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The one who kindled the fire also <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for what was inside </span>the stack, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis say: He pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the stack of wheat or barley, </span>as the case may be, and he is not responsible for that which was concealed within it.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a goat tied to </span>the stack of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there was a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave nearby </span>who was not tied to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>both the goat and the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">were burned </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the stack and killed, the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation for both. Conversely, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">slave was tied </span>to the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a goat nearby </span>that was not tied to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they were both <span class="gemarra-regular">burned together with it,</span> the one who kindled the fire is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from payment for damage because he is liable to receive capital punishment for murder, and he is punished only for the greater transgression.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and exempt one from payment for vessels concealed inside the stack in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to Rabbi Yehuda </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sets fire to a building</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything that was </span>burned <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, since it is the </span>normal <span class="gemarra-regular">way of people to place </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">in houses.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda concerning vessels concealed in a stack is referring specifically to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one kindled </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own </span>premises <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">spread and consumed </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">on another’s </span>property. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>the one who kindled the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">concealed </span>articles damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis exempt </span>him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">kindles </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">on another’s </span>premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">everything that is </span>contained <span class="gemarra-regular">within it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: If so, </span>that the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda in the case of one who kindles the fire on the premises of another, then <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than teaching the latter clause </span>that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sets fire to a building he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything </span>that was burned <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, since it is the </span>normal <span class="gemarra-regular">way of people to place </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">in houses, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> instead <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish and teach </span>the concession of the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">the same </span>case of one setting fire to a stack: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he kindled the fire on his own </span>premises <span class="gemarra-regular">and it spread and consumed </span>a stack <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the premises of <span class="gemarra-regular">another. But if he kindled </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>property belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another, all agree that he pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything that was </span>contained <span class="gemarra-regular">within it.</span> Since the mishna is not worded in this manner, it seems that this is not the opinion of the Rabbis.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to two </span>issues: <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>with regard to the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">kindles a fire on his own </span>premises <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it then <span class="gemarra-regular">spreads and consumes </span>a stack <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>property belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another, as Rabbi Yehuda deems </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for a concealed </span>article damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis hold </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable. And they disagree also </span>in the case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who kindles a fire on </span>premises belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another, as Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything within it, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a purse </span>of money if it was concealed within the stack, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis hold </span>that it is only for <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels that are typically concealed inside a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stack, such as threshing tools or yokes for cattle, that he must pay </span>compensation, but for <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>or other items <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not typicall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed inside a stack </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who kindles a stack and there were vessels inside it </span>that were <span class="gemarra-regular">burned, Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The one who kindled the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything that was inside it, but the Rabbis say: He pays</span> compensation only for the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a stack of wheat or a stack of barley, </span>and he does not pay compensation for the vessels. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views the place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessels </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it were filled with grain, </span>and calculates the amount of compensation accordingly. 

Daf 62a

<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is in a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">kindled a fire on his </span>premises <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">spread and burned </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>premises belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another. But </span>with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">kindles a fire on </span>premises belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>that destroys a stack of wheat, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">everything that was inside </span>the stack.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda concedes to the Rabbis that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">lends space to another </span>in his field <span class="gemarra-regular">to stack grain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>this person <span class="gemarra-regular">stacked </span>grain in the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and concealed </span>items inside the stack, if the owner of the field causes the stack to be burned down, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays compensation for the stack alone, </span>since the other person did not have permission to conceal items inside his stack. Similarly, if one received permission <span class="gemarra-regular">to stack wheat</span> in the field of another <span class="gemarra-regular">and he stacked barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> or conversely, if he received permission to stack <span class="gemarra-regular">barley and he stacked wheat; </span>or similarly, if he stacked <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and covered </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">with barley, </span>or stacked <span class="gemarra-regular">barley and covered </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in all these cases, Rabbi Yehuda concedes <span class="gemarra-regular">that he pays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">barley alone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is less than the value of wheat.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives a gold dina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for safekeeping <span class="gemarra-regular">and says to her: Be careful with this </span>dinar because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>made of <span class="gemarra-regular">silver, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>herself <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged </span>the dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">she must pay </span>compensation for the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gold dinar. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her: What </span>business <span class="gemarra-regular">did you have damaging it? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she was negligent </span>and it was lost or stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">she pays </span>as compensation only the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">a silver </span>dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">since she </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">undertook to safeguard only a silver </span>dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I did not undertake to safeguard a gold </span>dinar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: You teach this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> as a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, </span>but for <span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that taught: If one stacked <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and covered </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">with barley, </span>or stacked <span class="gemarra-regular">barley and covered </span>the stack <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat, </span>the one responsible for the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">pays compensation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the barley alone. Evidently, </span>the one who kindled the fire can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the stack: <span class="gemarra-regular">I undertook to safeguard </span>a stack of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley </span>but not a stack of wheat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of a golden dinar presented as a silver dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I did not undertake to safeguard a gold </span>dinar.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: I heard </span>a halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>in connection <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yehuda’s </span>opinion in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">but I do not know</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what it is. Shmuel said: And does Abba, </span>which was Rav’s name, really <span class="gemarra-regular">not know what he heard? </span>This is the statement that he heard: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for concealed </span>articles damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">applied the ordinance of a robbery victi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>one whose concealed items are damaged by <span class="gemarra-regular">his fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Just as the Sages instituted an ordinance that a robbery victim can take an oath as to what was stolen from him and the robber must repay him accordingly, similarly, according to Rabbi Yehuda the owner of the stack can take an oath that certain items were inside the stack, and the one responsible for the fire must pay compensation for them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar asks: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">they apply </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of a robbery victim in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an informe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> who causes another person’s property to be confiscated by the gentile authorities, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>The question is clarified: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not judge </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not ask </span>the question, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>according to that opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">we also do not judge </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">informers </span>who cause indirect damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, when you ask </span>this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we judge </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action, and the question is: Did the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">apply the ordinance of a robbery victim to </span>one whose items were taken due to an <span class="gemarra-regular">informer,</span> meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">can take an oath </span>to support his claim with regard to what was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>this amount in compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>No conclusion was reached about this, and the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
An incident was related about <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who kicked a saf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belonging to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sending it </span>flying <span class="gemarra-regular">into the river. The owner </span>of the safe <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to court <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: I had such and such inside it. Rav Ashi sat and was investigating </span>the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In a case like this, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does the court believe the claimant or not?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Is this not </span>identical to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sets fire to a building,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for everything that was </span>burned <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, since it is the </span>normal <span class="gemarra-regular">way of people to place </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">in houses? </span>Similarly, it is the normal way of people to place money in a safe, and the court should rely on the claim of the victim.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">were to claim </span>that there were <span class="gemarra-regular">coins</span> in the safe, this ruling would apply <span class="gemarra-regular">here also. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the claimant <span class="gemarra-regular">claims </span>that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a pearl [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">marganita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in the safe. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do people </span>typically <span class="gemarra-regular">place pearls in a safe, </span>in which case he should be believed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: </span>If the one whose home was burned by the fire were to <span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>that he had, among other items, <span class="gemarra-regular">a silver goblet in the building</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We view </span>his situation. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is a wealthy person, who </span>would typically <span class="gemarra-regular">have a silver goblet, or alternatively, if he is a trustworthy person with whom people entrust </span>valuable items, he <span class="gemarra-regular">can take an oath </span>that this is what he had <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>compensation according to his claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>such a person, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in his </span>power to be believed in such a claim.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: </span>Concerning two terms used to describe those who take another’s property against his will, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gazlan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamsan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamsan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gives mone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> for the article that he takes from its owner, albeit against the owner’s will, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gazlan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not give money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rav Adda was puzzled by this response and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If he gives money, do you </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">call him a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamsan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Since he pays money for it, he acquires it lawfully, despite the fact that its owner did not sell it voluntarily. <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Huna say: </span>If one was <span class="gemarra-regular">strung up </span>so that another could coerce him to sell a certain item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. </span>This indicates that a sale under duress is considered a valid sale. Rav Ashi answered: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case, where the sale under duress is legally considered to be a sale, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I want </span>to sell the item, despite having been forced. By contrast, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where the sale is invalid, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say: I want </span>to sell the item. 

Daf 62b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a spar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that emerged from under the hamme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of a blacksmith and started a fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">causing damage, </span>the blacksmith is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the damage caused.
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel that was lade</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with flax and was passing through the public domain, and its flax extended into a store and </span>the flax <span class="gemarra-regular">caught fire from a lamp </span>in the store <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to the storekeeper, and </span>as a result of the burning flax the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">set fire to the building </span>together with all its contents, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the camel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>But if <span class="gemarra-regular">the storekeeper placed his lamp outside,</span> thereby causing the flax on the camel to catch fire, and consequently the building was set on fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">the storekeeper </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In </span>a case where the lamp placed outside was <span class="gemarra-regular">a Hanukkah lamp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the storekeeper is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>since it is a mitzva for a Hanukkah lamp to be placed outside.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said in the name of Rava: Conclude from Rabbi Yehuda’s </span>statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva is to place the Hanukkah lamp within </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths from the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if it enters your mind </span>to say that the mitzva can also be fulfilled by placing it <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten handbreadths, why did Rabbi Yehuda say that </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Hanukkah lamp </span>placed outside, the storekeeper is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? Let </span>the owner of the camel <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the storekeeper: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have placed </span>the lamp <span class="gemarra-regular">above the </span>height <span class="gemarra-regular">of a camel and its rider </span>so that the flax would not catch fire. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>here that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva is to place it within ten handbreadths </span>of the ground and not higher?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>there is no proof from here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that one may place a Hanukkah lamp <span class="gemarra-regular">even above </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths, and as for <span class="gemarra-regular">what you said, </span>that the owner of the camel can claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have placed </span>the lamp <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the height <span class="gemarra-regular">of a camel and its rider, </span>in response to this one can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the store owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is performing a mitzva </span>by placing his Hanukkah lamp outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not trouble him to such an extent </span>to have him place his lamp at a height that would be inconvenient for him to reach.
Further on the subject of the height of a Hanukkah lamp, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Minyumi taught in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum: A Hanukkah lamp that is placed higher than twenty cubits </span>from the ground is <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit </span>to be used for the mitzva, since people do not generally look up to such a height, and the main purpose of the Hanukkah lamp is for it to be seen by others. In this regard, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the height of a Hanukkah lamp is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the height of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the height of a cross beam at the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are unfit for their respective purposes if they are higher than twenty cubits.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The principle of double payment </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">broadl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">than the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment, as the principle of double payment applies both to </span>the theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">something that is alive and to </span>the theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">something that is not alive, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to </span>the theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, </span>he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37).
Having stated a limitation to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of fourfold and fivefold payment, the mishna mentions a further limitation, which applies to all three types of payments. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">after a thie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the thief or to the prior owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor does one who slaughters or sells </span>an ox or a sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">after a thief </span>has already stolen it <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>Rather, he pays only the principal, i.e., the value of the item he stole.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches one particular difference between double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">while it does not teach </span>this difference between them: <span class="gemarra-regular">The principle of double payment applies both in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the case of a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit entrusted to him and who takes an oath to that effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span>not in the case of one who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen.
The fact that the mishna does not teach the latter distinction <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole a <span class="gemarra-regular">deposit </span>from him, and it is discovered that he himself is the thief, he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. </span>And if the stolen item is an ox or sheep and <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>According to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, there is no difference between the applications of double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment in this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of this discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, as Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole a <span class="gemarra-regular">deposit </span>from him, and it is discovered that he himself is the thief, he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. </span>And if the stolen item is an ox or sheep, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
The Gemara rejects the inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment except for the one mentioned in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches </span>merely that the principle of double payment applies <span class="gemarra-regular">more broadly </span>than the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment, and it provides an example of this statement. This does not mean that this is the only difference, and it is possible that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this one case <span class="gemarra-regular">and omitted </span>others.
§ The mishna teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that the principle of double payment applies </span>both to the theft of something that is alive and to the theft of something that is not alive. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For any matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or for any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges, the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">“For any matter of trespass” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">generalization; “whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail. </span>And when the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or for any manner of lost thing,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it then generalizes </span>again.
Consequently, this verse contains <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">detail, and a generalization</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and one of the thirteen rules of exegesis states that in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">you may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>each of the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detail </span>is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as an item that is movable property and </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>double payment is practiced with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that is movable property and </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Land is excluded</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is not movable property. </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves are excluded, as they are compared to lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in many areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. Financial <span class="gemarra-regular">documents are excluded, as, although they are movable property, they do not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value. The value of the material on which the document is written is negligible; documents are valuable only because they serve as proof for monetary claims. Finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">is exclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>in the verse that the one found liable shall pay double to <span class="gemarra-regular">“his neighbor,” </span>i.e., to another person, rather than to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of double payment is limited to cases similar to the details mentioned in the verse, it should also be derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>each of the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail</span> is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as an item whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too any item whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying </span>it is subject to double payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But birds, </span>whose carcasses do not transmit impurity through contact or carrying, should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be subject to double payment.
The Gemara objects to the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But how can you say this? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t “garment” written </span>in the list of specified items (Exodus 22:8)? It is impossible to speak of the impurity of carcasses with regard to clothing. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say, </span>in response to this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are speaking </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">of animals, </span>and this is the question that was asked: Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to animals, </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying, yes, </span>it is subject to double payment, whereas an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose carcass does not transmit impurity through contact and carrying, </span>such as a bird, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>a thief would not pay double payment for stealing it? 

Daf 63a

This line of reasoning is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">because we expound each on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the listed items in the <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization, and detail, </span>and generalization <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself. </span>Each item is treated individually as representing a category, but the different items are not grouped together into one broad category. Since several animals are listed, it is concluded that if the stolen item is an animal it must resemble the listed animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>do not transmit impurity through contact or carrying, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>subject to double payment.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let the Merciful One write </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">one detail, </span>i.e., animal, and that would have been enough to teach that animals are subject to double payment only if they transmit impurity through contact and carrying, so birds are excluded. Since the Torah listed several animals, birds are included.
The Gemara questions this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>individual animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should the Merciful One have written?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox,” I would say </span>that only an animal that is similar to an ox, in that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is sacrificed on the altar, yes, </span>it is subject to double payment. But an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not sacrificed on the altar, no, </span>it is not subject to double payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey,” I would say </span>that only an animal that is similar to a donkey, in that its firstborn male offspring is <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred with </span>the sanctity of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yes, </span>it is subject to double payment. But an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not sacred with </span>the sanctity of <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn, no, </span>it is not subject to double payment. The principle of double payment would then include cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys, but not other animals (see Exodus 13:13 and Deuteronomy 15:19).
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>in answer to this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the Torah had wished to limit double payment to cases where cattle, sheep, goats, or donkeys were stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” and “donkey”; why do I </span>need the verse to mention <span class="gemarra-regular">“sheep”? Conclude from it </span>that the Torah intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>even animals that do not meet these criteria, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">birds.</span>
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that the verse mentions sheep in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">kosher birds, </span>which are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> listed in the verse, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a carcass of these birds <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>both the one who eats it and his <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>when it passes through his <span class="gemarra-regular">esophagus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the carcass of a sheep also transmits ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">But non-kosher birds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose </span>carcasses <span class="gemarra-regular">do not have ritual impurity </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they do not render </span>either the one who eats them or his <span class="gemarra-regular">garments impure </span>when they pass through his <span class="gemarra-regular">esophagus,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no, </span>they are not subject to double payment. The Gemara answers: The word <span class="gemarra-regular">“any [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>in the phrase “for any [<span class="it-text">kol</span>] matter of trespass” is <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amplification, </span>and serves to include even non-kosher birds in the principle of double payment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is an amplification? But isn’t it </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written </span>in the verse: “And you shall bestow the money for whatever [<span class="it-text">bekhol</span>] your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you” (Deuteronomy 14:26)? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we expound </span>that verse <span class="gemarra-regular">as a generalization, and a detail, </span>and a generalization.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>as no particular type of food is specified. <span class="gemarra-regular">“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,” </span>is a <span class="gemarra-regular">detail, </span>as specific types of food are mentioned. When the verse concludes with <span class="gemarra-regular">“or for whatever your soul asks of you,” it has generalized again. </span>Since the verse is formulated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detail, and a generalization, you may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the detail. </span>This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>each of the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as the produce of produce, </span>i.e., they grow from a parent organism, e.g., agricultural produce or animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from the ground,</span> i.e., their sustenance comes from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>the category of items one may purchase with second-tithe money includes <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>items that are <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of produce and are grown from the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>in answer to this question that the term <span class="gemarra-italic">bekhol</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>whereas the term <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an amplification. And if you wish, say </span>an alternate answer: The word <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span> is usually <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> generalization. But </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the verse concerning double payment (Exodus 22:8), is an exception. It is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification, </span>as the Gemara will explain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">After all, </span>there is another <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization, and a detail, and a generalization written at the beginning </span>of this passage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man gives his neighbor” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization. “Money or vessels” is a detail. </span>When the verse concludes <span class="gemarra-regular">“to safeguard,” it has generalized again.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>later verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For any matter of trespass” </span>(Exodus 22:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">is also coming </span>to state <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, </span>and a generalization, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write these details, </span>i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment, which are cited in the later verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">together with that </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization, and detail, </span>and generalization. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the latter verse beginning with <span class="gemarra-regular">“for any matter of trespass”? Conclude from it </span>that the word <span class="it-text">kol</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is an amplification </span>in this instance, and it includes all animals.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you said </span>that the word <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">all these details </span>listed in the verse, i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment? The Gemara answers: As for the three animals listed, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude land, one to exclude </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, and one to exclude </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">documents. </span>The example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude an item that is not </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">delineated </span>in size or quantity. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or for any manner of lost thing” </span>is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole

Daf 63b

<span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item </span>that he had found, which he had been obligated to safeguard until it could be returned to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays double payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “For any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: </span>This is it…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(108b) about a case where an owner of an item said to the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my deposit? </span>The bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you </span>that it was actually lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>thereby accepting the oath; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>the deposit. In this case, the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the principal, </span>i.e., the value of the deposit, to the owner. If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted on his ow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that he stole the deposit before any witnesses testified to this effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the principal and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>of the principal amount to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering </span>to atone for his sin (see Leviticus 5:20–26).
The mishna continues with another case: The owner said to the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my deposit? </span>The bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It was stolen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen; and the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole </span>the deposit. In this case, the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>his theft <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he pays the principal and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering </span>to atone for his sin.
The Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays double payment, but in </span>the case of a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">claims that </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost, he does not pay double payment. And </span>it also teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>to substantiate his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">that he pays double payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>for simply lying <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath he does not pay double payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah states: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the thief shall be found </span>he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse is speaking of </span>a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">claims that </span>a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen, or is it </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">only about the thief himself, </span>teaching that if the actual thief is caught he must pay double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the thief shall not be found</span>…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:7–8), <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking of one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, as it states that no other thief was found. Since the latter verse is speaking of one who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen, it stands to reason that the earlier verse is speaking of this case as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the thief shall be found </span>he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of the thief himself. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about the thief himself, or is it </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">only about one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole? If so, then <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the verse then <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “If the thief shall not be found</span>…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:7–8), the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">stated. How, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the first verse about paying double: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the thief shall be found,” </span>so that it not be superfluous? It must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">verse is speaking of the thief himself.</span>
The Gemara comments: Although the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> disagree about the meaning of the earlier verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event everyone </span>agrees that the latter verse, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the thief shall not be not found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yimmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hagannav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span>…shall pay double to his neighbor,” is referring to a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is this interpretation <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred </span>from the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that the verse should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is not found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yimmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">as he said, </span>i.e., if his claim that the deposit was stolen is found to be untrue, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he himself stole it, he shall pay double </span>to his neighbor.
The Gemara turns its attention to another facet of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this double payment of one who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the bailee has taken <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>that it was stolen?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: “If the thief shall not be found, <span class="gemarra-regular">the homeowner shall approach the judges </span>to determine if he laid his hand [<span class="it-text">shalaḥ</span> <span class="it-text">yado</span>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This means that he shall come to court <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>he comes to court <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, or is it only for </span>the purpose of facing <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment? </span>The meaning may be determined by means of a verbal analogy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Laying </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hand [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shliḥut</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],</span> referring to misappropriation, <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated later, </span>in the verse: “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not laid his hand [<span class="it-text">shalaḥ</span> <span class="it-text">yado</span>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laying the hand is stated above, </span>i.e., Exodus 22:7. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as laying </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hand later </span>is referring explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">to an oath, so too </span>laying the hand <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an oath.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> cited earlier: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse about double payment is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">two verses are written, </span>as each verse teaches a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>of the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two verses? </span>One verse should be sufficient.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Both verses are necessary because <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>from double payment the case of one who falsely states <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>that the item has been <span class="gemarra-regular">lost. </span>Double payment is paid only when the bailee falsely claims that the item under his care was stolen.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about the thief and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no superfluous </span>verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he </span>learn <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>from double payment a bailee who falsely states <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>that the item has been <span class="gemarra-regular">lost? </span>The Gemara answers: He derives it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that the verse could have stated: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gannav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>shall not be found, but it states instead: “If <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hagannav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>shall not be found.”
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>verses are speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit one of the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>the case of a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">claims that </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost, what does he derive </span>from the fact that the verse did not state: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>shall not be found, but it states instead: “If <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief </span>shall not be found”?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that this terminology <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary to </span>teach <span class="gemarra-regular">what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>says, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>One who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thief </span>stole the <span class="gemarra-regular">deposit pays double payment, </span>and if the deposit was an ox or sheep and <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about a thief and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">who employed this </span>change in terminology, i.e., the fact that the verse could have stated: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>shall not be found, but states instead: “If <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief </span>shall not be found,” <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude</span> the case of a bailee who falsely states the <span class="gemarra-regular">claim that </span>the deposit was <span class="gemarra-regular">lost, </span>there seems to be no source to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated by Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, </span>that if the bailee slaughtered or sold the animal he pays a fourfold or fivefold payment?
The Gemara answers: He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: It is a juxtaposition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as liability for double payment for a thief and for a bailee who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen are juxtaposed to each other. Therefore, just as a thief pays a fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughtered or sold the animal, so must the bailee. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>although these two cases are not entirely comparable, this derivation cannot be refuted on that basis, as there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot refute </span>a derivation based on <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtapositio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> by drawing distinctions between the two juxtaposed cases.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the thief and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thief </span>stole the deposit, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. But according to the one who says that both </span>verses are speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief himself </span>must pay double payment for stealing?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Let it be derived by an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the case of the bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, because if one is obligated to pay double payment for falsely claiming that a deposit was stolen, which constitutes passive theft, all the more so must a thief himself pay double payment, this derivation is not possible. The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sufficient for the </span>conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference to be like </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">source. </span>In other words, a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived by means of an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference cannot be more stringent than the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the source from which it is derived. Consequently, on the basis of this <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference, it would have to be concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>in the source case, the double payment is required only when the guilty party took <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, so too here, </span>when the thief himself pays double, it is only when he took <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>that he did not steal it.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>the obligation of a thief to pay double payment without having taken an oath from a third verse: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The double payment in this verse applies to all items, as is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” and “theft,” and all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">would be included. </span>Why was it necessary to also mention “donkey” and “sheep”?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse had been written <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said: Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the item mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as </span>an item that <span class="gemarra-regular">is sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that is sacrificed on the altar </span>is subject to double payment, but other items are not. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">is there for you to include </span>in this category? <span class="gemarra-regular">Sheep, </span>which, like oxen, can be sacrificed on the altar. 

Daf 64a

<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states “sheep,” a sheep is thereby stated </span>explicitly. Therefore, the detail of “ox” cannot be written to include specifically items that can be sacrificed on the altar, e.g., a sheep. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>in the requirement of double payment.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues to analyze the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox,” “sheep,” and “theft,” and </span>in that manner <span class="gemarra-regular">everything </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">included. </span>Why is it necessary to write “donkey”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse been written in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, without “donkey,” <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said: Just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox” and “sheep,” are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as items that are </span>subject to being <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred with </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, so too any item that is </span>subject to being <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred with </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>is subject to double payment, but not other items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is there for you to include </span>in this category? <span class="gemarra-regular">A donkey. When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says “donkey,” a donkey is thereby stated </span>explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox” and “sheep” cannot be written to include specifically items that are subject to being sacred with the sanctity of the firstborn, e.g., a donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization?

The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues to analyze the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox,” and “donkey,” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“sheep,” and “theft,” and </span>in that manner <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">would be included. </span>Why is it necessary to write the word “alive”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse been written in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say: Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey,” are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as </span>items that are <span class="gemarra-regular">animals, so too all animals </span>are subject to double payment, but not inanimate objects.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is there for you to include </span>in this category that is not already listed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Animals other </span>than oxen, sheep, and donkeys. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“alive,” animals are thereby stated </span>explicitly.

This is the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
There are several puzzling elements of the halakhic exposition of the verse in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara now seeks to explain it in detail. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” and “theft.” </span>The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are “ox” and “theft”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in the verse in this order, as a generalization and a detail? No, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is “theft” and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” that is written. </span>Consequently, the verse contains a generalization and a detail, in which case the generalization is understood to refer only to that which is specified in the detail.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that this would be the case <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>the words in this manner, i.e.: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">stated “ox” and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>all items would have been included; <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you </span>then proceed to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Just as </span>the item mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox,” is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as </span>an item that can be sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that can be sacrificed on the altar is subject to double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">“Ox” is a detail and “theft” is a generalization, </span>and according to the rules of hermeneutics, in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">the generalization adds to the detail, and all items are included, </span>not just items that resemble the detailed item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the verse should be analyzed <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">written: </span>First <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft” and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox.” </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you </span>then proceed to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">would be included, or: Just as </span>the item mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>an item that can be sacrificed on the altar, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states? This analysis is applicable only when there is a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. In this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft” is a generalization and “ox” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail. </span>The rules of hermeneutics state that when there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a detail, there is nothing </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in the generalization other than what is </span>listed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the detail. </span>In this case, one would necessarily conclude that if one steals <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, yes, </span>he is liable to pay the double payment for stealing it, but if one steals <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else, no, </span>there is no double payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava stated </span>an explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> suggested: Let the verse say “ox” and “theft,” and similar suggestions, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was relying on </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“alive” </span>at the end of the phrase. He considered this word an additional generalization after the detailed items, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he was saying </span>that the phrase is to be treated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. </span>Consequently, it should have been sufficient for the verse to state merely “theft,” followed by “ox,” followed by “alive.” Why does the Torah specify further items?
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the latter generalization is not similar to the first generalization. </span>The first generalization, “theft,” is so general that it includes all items, whereas the latter generalization, “alive,” includes only animals. Consequently, the rule of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization should not apply. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the author of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of the school of Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who expounds generalizations and details in a case like this. </span>Even if the first generalization and the latter generalization are dissimilar, he interprets the verse as a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.
Rava continues his explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> found <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>at the end of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the beginning of the verse to state: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> with the verb repeated? Rava now explains the entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, from the beginning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span> the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">say “ox” and “theft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and “alive,” and all </span>items would be <span class="gemarra-regular">included, </span>in accordance with the rules of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. Why did the verse include other details?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers this by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse been written in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said: Just as </span>the item mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox,” is clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as an item that is sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that is sacrificed on the altar </span>is subject to double payment, but not other items. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>for you <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>in this category? <span class="gemarra-regular">A sheep. When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states “sheep,” a sheep is thereby stated </span>explicitly. Therefore, the detail of “ox” cannot be written to include specifically items that can be sacrificed on the altar, e.g., a sheep. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>in the requirement of double payment.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” and “ox” and “sheep” and “alive,” and all </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">would be included. </span>Why is it necessary to write “donkey”? The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse been written in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, without “donkey,” <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said: Just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox” and “sheep,” are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as items that are </span>subject to being <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred with </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn, so too any item that is </span>subject to being <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred with </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">firstbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is subject to double payment, but not other items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is there for you to include </span>in this category? <span class="gemarra-regular">A donkey. When</span> the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says “donkey,” a donkey is thereby stated </span>explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox” and “sheep” cannot be written to include specifically items that are subject to being sacred with the sanctity of the firstborn, e.g., a donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>in the requirement of double payment.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> then asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” and “ox,” and “sheep,” and “donkey” and “alive,” and </span>in that manner <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>items would be <span class="gemarra-regular">included. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse been written in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say: Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail, </span>“ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey,” are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as </span>items that are <span class="gemarra-regular">animals, so too all animals </span>are subject to double payment, but not inanimate objects.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is there for you to include </span>in this category that is not already listed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Animals other </span>than oxen, sheep, and donkeys. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states “alive,” animals are thereby stated </span>explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey” cannot be written to include animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">do I realize </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft,” </span>i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>in the requirement of double payment. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“if </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? </span>This is the conclusion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as explained by Rava. 

Daf 64b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if this is how the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to be understood, <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty </span>it posed <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid, </span>as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> ends with an unanswered question: Why do I need the phrase: “If the theft shall be found”?
The Gemara answers: This phrase is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is a refutation for </span>the derivation cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items? From the latter generalization </span>of “alive.” But in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>latter <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization itself </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“alive” is written. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What does </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization accomplish, </span>i.e., what does it include in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">items, </span>this cannot be, as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“alive” is written </span>in the verse, indicating that if one steals <span class="gemarra-regular">animals, yes, </span>he is liable to pay double payment, but if he steals <span class="gemarra-regular">something else, </span>i.e., inanimate objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he is not liable to pay double payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to this </span>reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary </span>for the Torah to include the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which includes all items, through the principle of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But these </span>repeated verbs <span class="gemarra-regular">are two generalizations that are adjacent to each other </span>in the verse, and the details follow both of the generalizations. Consequently, it is not a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, but rather of a generalization, a generalization, and a detail. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as they say in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any place </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">where you find two generalizations adjacent to each other, place the detail between them and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">treat them as a generalization, and a detail, </span>and a generalization.
The Gemara applies this principle to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Place </span>the first detail, <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox,” between “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” and “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>and treat the verse as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, so that other items that resemble the detail are included. <span class="gemarra-regular">To include what? If </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include animals, </span>this is not necessary, as animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are derived from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“alive” </span>later in the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include an item that is not an animal, </span>i.e., inanimate objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is how you should expound </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail</span> are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as movable property and </span>are items that have <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too anything that is movable property and has intrinsic monetary </span>value is included, to the exclusion of land and financial documents.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>following this method, <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the next detail, <span class="gemarra-regular">“donkey,” between </span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and treat it as a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, so that other items that resemble the detail are included. <span class="gemarra-regular">To include what? If </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include an item that is not an animal, </span>this is not necessary, as it already was <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox.” Rather, </span>it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include an object that is </span>clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">delineated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to the exclusion of objects that are not clearly delineated in size or quantity.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>if this is the correct way to analyze the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the verse to state <span class="gemarra-regular">“sheep”? </span>There is nothing left to include. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this whole approach must be rejected, and a new method of analysis applied, as follows: It is not treated as a case of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>treated as a verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified, restricted, and amplified, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught, </span>concerning the verse: “These may you eat of all that are in the waters: Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers” (Leviticus 11:9), as follows: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In the waters,” “in the waters,” two times </span>and only afterward lists the details of seas and rivers. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not </span>expounded as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, </span>and a generalization, because the detail does not appear between the generalizations. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">restricted, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified, </span>and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>the general category “waters” to include <span class="gemarra-regular">everything </span>except for “seas” and “rivers,” the specific matter excluded in the restriction, Here too, since the two generalizations are written before the details, it is expounded as an amplification, a restriction and an amplification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What do </span>the generalizations <span class="it-text">himmatze</span> and <span class="it-text">timmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">include? </span>Do they <span class="gemarra-regular">include all items? If so, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">all these details </span>of ox, sheep, and donkey? <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>detail serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude land, and one </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, and one </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">documents. </span>The words <span class="gemarra-regular">“theft” and “alive [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayyim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>do not serve to exclude further items from double payment, but <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>indicate the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who says: </span>If one stole an item, and it deteriorated or its value decreased, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">revive [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥayah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the principal </span>to the value it had <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, i.e., he must repay the owner according to the value of the item at the time it was stolen.
§ Until this point, the Gemara has been discussing the source of the obligation of a thief to pay double payment according to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (63b) that maintains that both verses (Exodus 22:6–7) are referring to a bailee who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the two verses <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about a thief and one </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he derives </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief himself</span> must pay double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“if the thief shall be found” </span>(Exodus 22:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he derive from this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be found” </span>(Exodus 22:3)?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava bar Ahilai, as Rava bar Ahilai says: What is the reason </span>for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, who says: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] through witnesses </span>that he is liable to pay the fine of double payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will be found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>that the fine will be enforced <span class="gemarra-regular">by judges. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>from double payment the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who incriminates himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> by admitting his liability before any witnesses testify concerning him, and the same is applied to all cases that involve fines.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span> verses are speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">who applies this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found,” to the thief himself, from where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who incriminates himself </span>is exempt from paying double payment or any other fine? The Gemara answers: He derives it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The one whom the judges convict </span>shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that only one who is convicted by the judges on the basis of testimony must pay double, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not one who incriminates himself.</span>
The Gemara continues its line of questioning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about a thief </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">who derives from: “If </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found” that one who incriminates himself </span>is exempt from payment of the fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does he expound from this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The one whom the judges convict </span>shall pay double to his neighbor”? He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary to </span>teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>his liability to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment if witnesses never come to testify against him. “If the theft shall be found” indicates that even if witnesses do come after he admitted his liability, he is exempt from paying the fine.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>verses <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thief </span>stole the deposit, and, as explained previously, derives from “if the theft shall be found” that a thief is required to pay double payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, and afterward witnesses came </span>and testified to his liability, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay the fine, contrary to the opinion of Rav.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>verse is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">who derives </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of double payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief from there, </span>i.e., from the verse “if the thief shall be found” (Exodus 22:6), there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“if </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found” </span>is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>teaching the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ahilai. But why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">all these details, </span>“ox,” “donkey,” “sheep,” and “alive”? All the items excluded from double payment, such as land and slaves, are already derived from a different source.
The Gemara answers: This may be explained <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Any passage that was stated </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">and was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">repeated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was repeated only for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that was introduced </span>for the first time in the repeated passage. That is, sometimes the Torah repeats an entire passage just for the sake of a single new detail. The single new detail derived from this passage is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who admits that he is liable to pay a fine is exempt from paying the fine, which is derived from the words: “If the theft shall be found.”
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>since the two cases of a thief and a bailee who falsely claims the deposit was stolen are juxtaposed, as their obligations to pay double payment are expressed in consecutive verses, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief himself </span>is not obligated to pay double payment unless he falsely confirms his innocence <span class="gemarra-regular">with an oath, </span>just as a bailee is liable to pay double payment only under these circumstances.
The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says </span>that the phrase “if the theft shall be found…<span class="gemarra-regular">he shall pay double” </span>indicates that a thief pays double even <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Ya’akov elaborates: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>the verse obligates every thief, even <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>his taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath? Or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>of a thief who falsely confirms his innocence <span class="gemarra-regular">with an oath? You </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">say: This </span>second possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>the Torah’s intent.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">This was not </span>the Torah’s intent? What is the proof that the Torah could not have meant that only a thief who falsely confirms his innocence with an oath pays double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>If this was the Torah’s intent, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One not write “he shall pay double” with regard to a thief </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let it be derived through an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the case of a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, as follows: If, in the case of a bailee who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom the </span>deposit initially <span class="gemarra-regular">came into his possession in a permitted </span>fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states that he must pay double, </span>then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief himself, for whom </span>the stolen object <span class="gemarra-regular">came into his possession in a prohibited manner </span>from the start, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>that he must pay double payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“he shall pay double,” which the Merciful One wrote concerning a thief himself? </span>It must be that the verse adds to the requirement of double payment for a thief and indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he must pay double <span class="gemarra-regular">even without </span>having taken <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does this </span>verse, which states <span class="gemarra-regular">“if </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found” </span>and concludes “he shall pay double,” <span class="gemarra-regular">come for this </span>purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it required for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession.” From the term “in <span class="gemarra-regular">his possession </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ado</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>

Daf 65a

<span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>a case where the stolen item is found in <span class="gemarra-regular">his hand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ado</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where </span>do I derive that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies if it is found on <span class="gemarra-regular">his roof, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">his yard, or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">his enclosure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vekarpeifo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The verse states </span>the repetitive phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“if </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be found [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>to indicate that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>i.e., in any location that the stolen item is found.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if this is all the phrase is coming to teach, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse state </span>the identical word twice: <span class="gemarra-italic">Himmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">himmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Timmatze</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">timmatze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse varied </span>its wording, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from it: </span>That one is liable to pay double payment regardless of where the stolen item was found, and that a thief pays double payment even if he did not take an oath.
§ The Gemara returns to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rav says: </span>When a thief makes his payments, the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal </span>is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, whereas the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>are calculated <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason, </span>i.e., the source, for this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“If the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>shall be found in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, </span>whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Why is the Merciful One saying “alive [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayyim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” in </span>the context of this <span class="gemarra-regular">theft? </span>This juxtaposition serves to teach: When making payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">revive [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥayah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the principal </span>to the value it had <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav was sleepy and lying dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to rest, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rav Sheshet meant that this is a careless ruling, as it is contrary to a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the animal was stolen when it was <span class="gemarra-regular">lean and </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">fattened it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment according to </span>the value of the animal as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it. This shows that the double payment and the fourfold and fivefold payment are applied in accordance with the value of the item at the time of the theft, not its value at the time of trial, as claimed by Rav.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not a refutation of Rav’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">could say to </span>the owner of the animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">I fattened </span>the animal myself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and will you take </span>for yourself  the added value from its fattening? In this particular case, Rav would agree that all payments are in accordance with the value of the item at the time of the theft.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that apparently contradicts Rav’s ruling. If the animal was stolen when it was <span class="gemarra-regular">fat and the thief caused it to become lean</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the value of the animal as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it. The double and fourfold and fivefold payments are not paid in accordance with the value at the time of the trial, as claimed by Rav.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, </span>there is a reason for this exception, <span class="gemarra-regular">because we say of </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it to me </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he killed it partially? </span>By causing the animal to become lean, the thief is considered to have started to put it to death. Consequently, when he ultimately kills the animal, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment according to its value when he first began to weaken it, i.e., at the time of the theft. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav says </span>his ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying </span>it only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">appreciation </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">and depreciation </span>in value, not to changes in the animal’s physical state.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case referred to by Rav? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that initially </span>the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">was worth one dinar and in the end it was worth four dinars, </span>and Rav teaches that the thief pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal according to </span>the value of the animal as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, which is one dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall we say that Rav disagrees with this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba? As Rabba says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who robbed another of a barrel of wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially worth one dinar and ultimately it was worth four dinars, </span>and after its appreciation the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">broke </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">or drank </span>the wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays four </span>dinars. If the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">broke by itself, he pays one dinar. </span>Rabba holds that even the principal is paid according to the time when he broke the barrel. 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response that Rav agrees with Rabba with regard to the above case. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> his <span class="it-text">halakha</span> he is referring to a case where, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>the item was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially worth four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately was worth one dinar. </span>In this situation, Rav maintains that the thief does not profit from the decrease in the value of the principal. Rather, he pays the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal according to </span>its value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina teaches </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in support of Rav: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner </span>acting as a bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the <span class="gemarra-regular">deposit, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>as to the truth of his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>that he was lying and that he in fact took the item himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at some point <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified that the bailee himself had the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he admitted </span>his guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">before the witnesses came </span>and testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth, and </span>he must also bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But if he admitted </span>his guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">after witnesses came </span>and testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering, and his </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth is covered by his double payment </span>that he pays; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov. </span>

Daf 65b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>It is written concerning a bailee who falsely claims innocence with regard to a deposit entrusted to him: “He shall restore it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its principal, and </span>shall add <span class="gemarra-regular">its fifth part </span>to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is paid </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the principal, one adds one-fifth, </span>but for <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution that is not paid </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the principal, </span>as is the case here, where the bailee pays double the principal value, <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not add one-fifth. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: </span>Neither the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth nor </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering is pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a case where there is double payment. </span>This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
Rabbi Ḥanina explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: His </span>payment of the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth is covered by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his double payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>the stolen item was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially worth four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately, </span>at the time of trial, was still <span class="gemarra-regular">worth four </span>dinars, how could he say: <span class="gemarra-regular">His </span>payment of the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth is covered by his double payment?</span>
This statement is inaccurate in this case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment, </span>i.e., the penalty included in the double payment, is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth is one dinar. </span>When the Torah states “fifth” it means one-fifth of the total payment of the one-fifth and the principal together, i.e., one-quarter of the principal. For the additional one-fifth to be covered by the double payment, the two must be exactly equal, which is not the case here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a situation where <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and at the end </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one dinar, as the </span>penalty component of the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one dinar and the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>is also <span class="gemarra-regular">one dinar?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal, </span>as well as the additional one-fifth, is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole, </span>whereas the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial, </span>as claimed by Rav.
The Gemara refutes this analysis. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> could be referring to a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and now, </span>at the time of trial, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also worth four </span>dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">what is difficult </span>with this case, namely that <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one dinar, </span>this problem can be resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>that the deposit was stolen from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he again took </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and so on <span class="gemarra-regular">four times, and </span>after each oath <span class="gemarra-regular">he admitted </span>afterward that he had lied. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Torah said: “And </span>shall add <span class="gemarra-regular">its fifth part [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamishitav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to it” (Leviticus 5:24).
Rava continues: The term <span class="it-text">ḥamishitav</span> is in the plural, which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah included </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>payments of an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a single principal. </span>In other words, each time the bailee takes a false oath he becomes obligated to pay an additional one-fifth, despite the fact that each oath concerns the same item. Since he did so four times, and the one-fifth is actually one-quarter of the principal, the total amount of payments of the additional one-fifth is equal to the principal, which is the same as the penalty component of the double payment.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Sages say: </span>“He shall restore it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its principal, and </span>shall add <span class="gemarra-regular">its fifth part </span>to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that for <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution that is paid </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the principal, one adds one-fifth. </span>But for <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution that is not paid </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the principal, one does not add one-fifth. </span>The Gemara infers: He does not add one-fifth, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he </span>is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a guilt-offering.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: </span>“He shall restore it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its principal, and </span>shall add <span class="gemarra-regular">its fifth part </span>to it.” This indicates that the additional one-fifth is linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal amount. If so, with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt offering as well, </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay, </span>i.e., bring it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“He shall restore it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its principal, and </span>shall add <span class="gemarra-regular">its fifth part </span>to it…<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his guilt-offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’et</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ashamo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>he shall bring to the Lord” (Leviticus 5:24–25). The verse links the guilt-offering to the payment of the precise amount of the principal, just like it does the additional one-fifth.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>in response: The superfluous word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> in the phrase “and his guilt offering [<span class="it-text">ve’et</span> <span class="it-text">ashamo</span>]” <span class="gemarra-regular">divides the verse. </span>Therefore, only the additional one-fifth payment, but not the guilt-offering, is linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, </span>who maintains that this bailee is exempt from a guilt-offering as well, how would he respond to the Sages’ argument concerning “<span class="it-text">et</span>”? He would point out that the term in question is actually <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>consisting of the word <span class="it-text">et</span> preceded by the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span>, meaning “and.” The conjunction <span class="gemarra-regular">joins </span>the clauses of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse. </span>Therefore, both the additional one-fifth payment and the guilt-offering are linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>would respond to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s claim and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: </span>If the Torah had intended that the two issues should be joined together, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write neither </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in response to this argument: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not possible</span> for the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">to have not written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,”</span> as this term is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to separate between property </span>belonging to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High, </span>i.e., the guilt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and non-sacred property, </span>i.e., that of a Jew. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>as the verse had to use “<span class="it-text">et</span>” to indicate this difference, the <span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">joins </span>the clauses of the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse.</span>
§ The Gemara discusses other cases in which an object undergoes a change after it has been stolen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ile’a says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole a lamb and it </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">became a ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf and it </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">became a bull, </span>the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">has undergone a change </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, and he has </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it </span>as his own property. Consequently, his obligation of restitution consists of monetary payment rather than giving back the stolen item itself. If he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, it is in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters, </span>or it is <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells,</span> and he is not obligated in the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina raised an objection to Rabbi Ile’a </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole a lamb and it </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">became a ram, </span>of if he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf and it </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">became a bull, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment according to </span>the animal’s value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that in a case of this kind the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>the animal as his own property <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>virtue of the physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>the animal underwent when it matured, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does he pay </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment? After all, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters, </span>or it is <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells.</span>
Rabbi Ile’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rather, what </span>would you conclude from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> this physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>in the stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>serve to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it for the thief and render it his property? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>should he <span class="gemarra-regular">pay according to </span>the animal’s value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him pay according to </span>the animal’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>i.e., at the time of the slaughter or sale.
Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is the reason that he does not pay in accordance with </span>the animal’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">now: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the thief can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the animal’s owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did I steal a bull from you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did I steal a ram from you? </span>No; I stole only a calf or a lamb, and therefore I will pay you the value of the animal when I stole it. Rabbi Ile’a <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Ḥanina: <span class="gemarra-regular">May the Merciful One save us from this opinion </span>of yours! Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: On the contrary, may the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One save us from your opinion!</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira objects to this: But </span>even if an animal’s natural growth is not considered a physical change, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the thief acquire it through </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">change in name, </span>i.e., its change of classification, as the animal was originally called a calf or a lamb and now it is considered a bull or ram.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>There is in fact no change in name here, as even <span class="gemarra-regular">a day-old bull is called a bull, </span>and even <span class="gemarra-regular">a day-old ram is called a ram. A day-old bull is called a bull, as it is written: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born” </span>(Leviticus 22:27).
<span class="gemarra-regular">A day-old ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is called a ram, </span>as can be derived from Jacob’s statement to Laban, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And the rams of your flock I have not eaten” </span>(Genesis 31:38). Now, did Jacob mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not eat </span>any of Laban’s <span class="gemarra-regular">rams, </span>but younger <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs he did eat? </span>This is certainly not the meaning of this verse, as this would mean he was a thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>this verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">a day-old ram is called a ram?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier by Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>for the opinion of Rabbi Ile’a, as it states that the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment despite the fact that the slaughter or sale of the animal took place after it matured from a calf to a bull or from a lamb to a ram. To resolve the difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, who say: </span>An item, even if it has undergone a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change, remains in its place, </span>i.e., a stolen item remains in the possession of its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>it even if it undergoes a change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one gave wheat</span> to a prostitute <span class="gemarra-regular">for her payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the hire of her services, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">made </span>the wheat into <span class="gemarra-regular">flour; </span>or if he gave her <span class="gemarra-regular">olives and </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">made them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">oil; </span>or if he gave her <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes and </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">made them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to bring these products as an offering in the Temple, in accordance with the verse: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot…into the house of the Lord your God for any vow” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that these products are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as the physical change renders them into new items. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Guryon of Asporak teaches </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai prohibit </span>these products <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>them. If so, these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> reflect a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.
The Gemara clarifies the source of these two opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of Beit Shammai </span>for prohibiting these products? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: </span>“You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord your God for any vow; for even both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The apparently superfluous word <span class="gemarra-regular">“even” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include their changed </span>status. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel, </span>who permit these items after they have undergone a physical change, maintain that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“these” </span>in the phrase “both of these” teaches that this prohibition applies only to the original items, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">their changed </span>form.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Shammai </span>would reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> term, 

Daf 66a

<span class="gemarra-regular"> “these,” comes to </span>teach that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only to the animals given as payment to the prostitute <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">their offspring. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>from where do <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? They would say that one should <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude two</span> conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“These” </span>items are disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>when they are in <span class="gemarra-regular">their changed </span>form, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “these” </span>are disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not their offspring. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, isn’t it written “even”? </span>Since Beit Hillel reject the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that Beit Shammai derive from this term, what do they learn from it? The Gemara states: Indeed, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“even” is difficult according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel.</span>
In any event, they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only with regard to</span> this particular issue: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>in a stolen item causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>in a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>of the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays according to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>value of the item, at the time of the theft, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">He pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment according to </span>the animal’s value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? As Rav says: </span>When a thief makes his payments, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal according to </span>the value as of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, whereas the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>are calculated <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of standing trial. Rava said </span>in resolution of this difficulty: If one stole <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs </span>that subsequently became rams or were fattened, he pays the double payment and the fourfold or fivefold payment according to the <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>state of the animal, as claimed by both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. If there was a change in the animal’s value due to fluctuation of the monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>of animals, he pays <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the animal’s worth <span class="gemarra-regular">now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at the time of standing trial.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in a stolen item causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we learned </span>it in a mishna as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>in the Torah: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he shall restore the item that he robbed” </span>(Leviticus 5:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>the seemingly superfluous phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“that he robbed”? </span>This serves to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the item is the same <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stole </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must return </span>the stolen item itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the same as it was then, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay only money, </span>while the stolen item remains his to keep.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a mishna as well, as it is taught (93b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fashions it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, </span>or one who robs another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and fashions it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, he pays </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value of the goods at the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of the robbery, </span>and keeps the altered materials for himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>another mishna can serve as the source for this principle (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 135a): <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one did not manage to giv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the first of the sheared wool of his sheep to a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">he dyed it </span>(see Deuteronomy 18:4), he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from giving it to the priest. This mishna indicates that an item that has undergone a change is no longer considered the same item as it had been. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>in a stolen item causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it.
§ Rabba continues to discuss the ways in which a thief acquires ownership of a stolen item: With regard to the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> over ever recovering the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages say that </span>this too causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the stolen item. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, we do not know if </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law or by rabbinic law.</span>
Rabba elaborates on the two possibilities he has just mentioned: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is with regard to one who finds a lost item. </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who finds a lost item </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs </span>of recovering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">came into </span>the finder’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, </span>the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires it </span>and may keep it for himself? The same principle applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: Once the owner </span>of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs </span>of recovering it, the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires it </span>for himself and need no longer return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>then, the despair of the owner causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the stolen item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the case of a stolen item is <span class="gemarra-regular">not comparable to </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a lost item, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item </span>that the owner’s despair enables the finder to acquire the item, because the item <span class="gemarra-regular">came into his possession in a permitted </span>manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">came into his possession in a prohibited </span>manner, this case cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a lost item. If so, the ruling that despair effects acquisition in a case of theft applies not by Torah law but <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law.</span>
Why would this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> have been instituted by rabbinic law? <span class="gemarra-regular">As, the Sages said that </span>a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">should acquire</span> the stolen item in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to an ordinance </span>instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the penitent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> To encourage thieves to repent and repay their victims, the Sages instituted that they need not return the stolen item after the owner despairs of recovering it. Rather, they can reimburse the owner for the monetary value of the item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef says: Despair </span>on the part of the owner over the possibility of recovering his item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that item at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even by rabbinic law. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an objection to Rabba </span>from a mishna (96b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread and Passover elapse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the meantime, so that deriving benefit from it is prohibited, 

Daf 66b

the robber may nonetheless return the worthless bread to the owner and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: That which is yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is before you, </span>and no compensation is required. Rav Yosef states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">once the time of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>of leavened bread <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly despairs </span>of recovering his now-worthless bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it enters your mind </span>to say that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>causes the robber to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">he say to him: That which is yours is before you? He should be required to pay </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged money </span>rather than return the worthless food, as the bread now belongs to the robber.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>him in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I say </span>that the thief acquires the stolen item upon the owner’s despair of recovery it is when <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs, and that </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to acquire </span>the item. In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs but that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not wish to acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the worthless bread.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to Rabba </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <span class="gemarra-regular">“his offering,” but not </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">stole</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from another. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case referred to by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrates and sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovery, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>to teach this? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to one who seeks to consecrate and sacrifice a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair? </span>And yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the animal cannot be consecrated by the thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> it, as if it belonged to him he would be able to consecrate and sacrifice it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Abaye in refutation of this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning,</span> consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written with regard to a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge: “And whoever touches his bedding shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). This indicates that bedding on which a <span class="it-text">zav</span> lies can become ritually impure and impart impurity only if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">“his bedding,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>bedding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that he robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and made it into bedding, is there anyone who says that </span>a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>that results from <span class="gemarra-regular">an action </span>performed to a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire it? Rather, what have you to say? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be speaking of a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the <span class="it-text">zav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">bedding</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> So too, </span>the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with one <span class="gemarra-regular">who robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>already consecrated. The reason this animal does not atone for the thief is that a consecrated animal cannot be stolen and become the thief’s property, as it belongs to the Temple treasury wherever it is located.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to Rav Yosef </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 26:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hides belonging to a homeowner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to </span>contracting <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to hides <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to a leatherworker, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>Since this individual sells leather to others, when he uses a piece of leather for a household purpose and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, this is not considered a finished state, as he is likely to change his mind and sell the leather to one who will process it further and put it to a different use.
The mishna continues: If the hides are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a thief, </span>who has stolen them from another, the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>If they are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, </span>because he is not considered the owner of the hide. The difference is that unlike the case of a thief, who steals items stealthily, the identity of a robber, who takes the item openly, is known to the owner, and the owner harbors hope of finding the robber and getting the item back. Consequently, he does not despair of recovering his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the matters are reversed: </span>In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a robber, </span>the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>If the hides are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a thief, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, because the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> owners have not despaired </span>of recovering them and the thief has not acquired the hide. Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is that a robber, who seizes items brazenly, is a more difficult criminal to apprehend and bring to justice than a thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>although the two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the mishna disagree as to which situation involves an owner’s despair of recovery, whether robbery or theft, in any event one can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this mishna that the <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of the owner causes the thief or robber to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item, as otherwise the perpetrator’s thoughts about the hide would have no effect on its status with regard to ritual impurity. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here </span>in this mishna? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief or robber <span class="gemarra-regular">trimme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the leather by cutting it. Although trimming a piece of leather is not a sufficient change to constitute an act of acquisition by itself, it is effective in conjunction with the owner’s despair.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan objects to this </span>answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>with regard to a leather table <span class="gemarra-regular">top [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itzba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>a leather table <span class="gemarra-regular">top does not require trimming, </span>either due to the fact that its edges are not seen or because it is merely ornamental. Since it does not require trimming, this action should not be considered an act of acquisition at all.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the previous mishna (<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 26:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no work lackin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> for an item to be considered finished, one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders it susceptible to ritual impurity; when there is </span>still some <span class="gemarra-regular">work lacking </span>for the item to be considered finished, <span class="gemarra-regular">thought does not render it susceptible to ritual impurity,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for </span>the case of a leather table <span class="gemarra-regular">top</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although further work is required to smooth out the edges, one’s thought can render it susceptible to impurity because people do not care if this leather table top has uneven edges. It is with regard to this case of a table top that the mishna distinguishes between a homeowner and a leatherworker. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s explanation is rejected.
The Gemara suggests a different answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter was a difficulty </span>posed by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba to Rav Yosef for twenty-two years, and it was not resolved until Rav Yosef sat as the hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> of the yeshiva <span class="gemarra-regular">and resolved it </span>in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">A change in nam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of an item, representing a change in status, <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to </span>a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>brought about by <span class="gemarra-regular">an action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">an action </span>causes the thief to acquire the item? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the stolen items were <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels. </span>The same can be said for <span class="gemarra-regular">a change in name as well: Initially they called it a hide, and now </span>they call it a table <span class="gemarra-regular">top [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">abrazin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to changes in name: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what about the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where there is a change in name, as initially, </span>when it was stolen, it was called <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam, and now, </span>after it has been placed in a building, it is called <span class="gemarra-regular">a joist [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">telala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 55a): <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a stolen bea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>a robber <span class="gemarra-regular">had built</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>a large <span class="gemarra-regular">building, </span>the court ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>receive <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>value in <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>rather than demand that the robber demolish the house to return the beam itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">because of an ordinance </span>instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the penitent,</span> i.e., to encourage robbers to admit their crime and reimburse the owner of the stolen item.
This mishna indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>the robber does not have to return the beam itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance </span>instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the penitent. </span>

Daf 67a

One can infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>decree, the beam would have to be <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>to the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">as is, </span>notwithstanding its change in name. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This is not a genuine change in name, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam retains its name </span>even after it is inserted into a building. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to two obscure terms: The verse states: “And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch; there were also the <span class="it-text">tzalot</span> of the house, and the <span class="it-text">ubbim</span>” (Ezekiel 41:26). <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzalot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the house”; these are the casings [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hamaltetin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ubbim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; these are the beams [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hamerishot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>This shows that a beam can retain its name even after it has been built into a house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>a different answer: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change in name, a change </span>in which the item <span class="gemarra-regular">can revert to its original stat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>considered enough of <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>for the thief to acquire the stolen item. Since the joist can be removed and revert to being called a beam, it is not considered a true change of name.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is a change in name </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not revert to its original state </span>really considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a change? But there is </span>the case of a water <span class="gemarra-regular">duct</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">a log [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ketzitzta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and now </span>it is called <span class="gemarra-regular">a duct, and it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A duct that one hollowed ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and afterward attached </span>to the ground or to a building <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates a ritual bath </span>through the water it channels to the bath. The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel.
By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one attached it </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath. </span>Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel.
The Gemara states its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that a change in name is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter </span>of significance, i.e., it is considered a real change in the item, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if one attached </span>the log first <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afterward hollowed it out, </span>the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be invalid. </span>Since hollowing out the log leads to a change in name, it should be considered a new vessel at that point.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn </span>water may not be used for a ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as it </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and consequently the Sages were lenient in this case. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">even in the first clause, </span>where the log was hollowed out before being attached, it should be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The Gemara answers: There is a difference between the two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the first clause, the log <span class="gemarra-regular">had the status of a vessel while </span>it was still <span class="gemarra-regular">detached. Here, </span>in the second case, it did <span class="gemarra-regular">not have the status of a vessel while </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">detached, </span>but only after it became attached to the ground, and therefore the Sages were lenient.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against Rav Yosef’s opinion that the owner’s despair that he will recover his stolen items does not effect acquisition for the thief, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, a robber, and one who forces </span>people to sell him items against their will, <span class="gemarra-regular">their consecration </span>of the items they obtained in these manners is a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">consecration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that they separate </span>from the produce they obtained in these manners is valid <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the tithes that they separate </span>from those foods are valid <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes. </span>Consecrations, <span class="it-text">terumot</span>, and tithes must be performed by the owner of the item in question. Since there was no physical change in these items, this shows that the thief is considered the new owner merely by virtue of the owner’s despair of recovery.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>in answer to this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in those cases involving consecrations, <span class="it-text">terumot</span>, and tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a change in nam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">as initially </span>the stolen food was called <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., produce from which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes have not been separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now </span>it is called <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> or tithe. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">consecration, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now </span>it is called <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a change </span>in a stolen item causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery” </span>(Leviticus 5:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>the seemingly superfluous phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“that he took by robbery”? </span>It teaches that only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the item is in the same state <span class="gemarra-regular">as when he took it by robbery </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he must return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, he is required to pay only money; </span>the stolen item remains his to keep.
The Gemara asks with regard to this derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That he took by robbery,” is required to exclude </span>the case of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen by one’s father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when a son returns an item or money that his father had stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not add one-fifth to </span>the principal amount of that which <span class="gemarra-regular">his father stole. </span>The passage in question addresses one who stole and took a false oath. This individual is obligated to add one-fifth to the amount he stole (see Leviticus 5:21–24). The apparently redundant phrase “that he took by robbery,” teaches that the requirement to add one-fifth applies only to the sinner himself, not to his heirs (see 104b).
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the verse teaches only that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write </span>merely: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall return his stolen item, </span>as from that phrase alone it could be derived that an heir does not have to add one-fifth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">to write </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“that he took by robbery”? </span>One may therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude two </span>conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this verse: A son need not add one-fifth, and a change in a stolen item effects acquisition for the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of the above statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: From where </span>is it derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery” </span>(Leviticus 5:23), from which it may be inferred that he must return it <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>even if it has undergone a change. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is written “that he took by robbery,” </span>which indicates that, on the contrary, the item need be returned only if it is in a similar state to when it was stolen. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is required </span>to teach another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One adds one-fifth upon</span> returning <span class="gemarra-regular">his own stolen </span>item concerning which he had taken a false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not add one-fifth upon </span>returning something <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen by his father.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering his stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated </span>in the criticism of the Jewish people for bringing inferior animals as offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you have brought that which is stolen, and the lame, and the sick” </span>(Malachi 1:13). From the juxtaposition of these cases it may be derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">a stolen </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to a lame </span>animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a lame </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has no rectification at all </span>with regard to its disqualification as an offering, 

Daf 67b

<span class="gemarra-regular">so too a stolen </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has no rectification </span>for its disqualification. There is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference whether </span>one is dealing with a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. </span>In either case, it is disqualified. This shows that the owner’s despair does not effect acquisition for the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <span class="gemarra-regular">“his offering,” but not </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>from another. <span class="gemarra-regular">When, </span>i.e., in which circumstances, is it necessary to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrated and sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovery, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>to teach this? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that it is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to one who seeks to consecrate and sacrifice a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair? </span>And yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the animal cannot be consecrated by the thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>it, as if it belonged to him he would be able to consecrate and sacrifice it. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is so.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rava was the one who said </span>that this proof can be refuted, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be interpreted as dealing with one <span class="gemarra-regular">who robbed another of an offering </span>that was already consecrated. Rava apparently contradicts himself. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>one of these two statements. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, </span>not Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">said one of these </span>two statements.
§ The Gemara returns to the mishna, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment </span>applies only to the theft of an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>is the fourfold and fivefold payment limited to oxen and sheep? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us derive </span>otherwise by a verbal analogy of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” </span>in this verse and <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” from </span>a passage dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where it is stated: “And the seventh day is Sabbath to the Lord your God, you shall not perform any labor, you, your son, and your daughter, and your slave, and your maidservant, and your ox, and your donkey, and all your animals, and the gentile that is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 5:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to Shabbat, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated with regard to an ox is not limited to oxen, as <span class="gemarra-regular">undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to </span>oxen in that they too are included in this prohibition, as the verse states: “Nor any of your animals,” <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>in the case of theft, one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to </span>oxen in that the fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred for their theft.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The verse </span>dealing with theft <span class="gemarra-regular">states “ox” and “sheep,” “ox” and “sheep” twice. </span>This repetition indicates that for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and a sheep, yes, </span>there is a fourfold or fivefold payment, and <span class="gemarra-regular">for other items, no, </span>there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says, </span>with regard to Rava’s assertion that one of the instances of “ox” and “sheep” is superfluous: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>instance of the word “ox” or “sheep” <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">superfluous </span>one? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” and “sheep” at the end </span>of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is superfluous, due to </span>the following consideration: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Merciful One write: If one steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for it and four sheep for it, </span>without repeating the words “ox” and “sheep,” this is not possible. <span class="gemarra-regular">If the Merciful One had written </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">like this, I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to pay nine </span>animals, five oxen and four sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every </span>animal stolen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that this interpretation is not possible, as the suggestion is that the verse would have <span class="gemarra-regular">written: For it, for it, </span>twice, whereas if a payment of nine animals were required for each stolen animal the verse would have written: For it, only once; then <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>mention of: <span class="gemarra-regular">For it, is superfluous, </span>to teach us that it is five for an ox and four for a sheep.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>repetition of: For it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is required for another interpretation, </span>and cannot teach that it is five for an ox and four for a sheep. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an expensive <span class="gemarra-regular">ox worth one hundred dinars he may pay </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for it </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">lean, </span>inferior <span class="gemarra-regular">animals [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">negidin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For </span>the ox” and <span class="gemarra-regular">“for </span>the sheep,” which indicates that the oxen and sheep used for payment must be similar to the stolen animal in quality. Since one might have erred and understood that the thief is required to pay nine animals, five oxen and four sheep, for each and every animal stolen, that suggested version of the verse is not a possibility. The words “ox” and “sheep” at the end of the verse could not have been omitted, so they are not superfluous.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” and “sheep” in the first </span>part of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">are superfluous, due to </span>the following consideration: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Merciful One write: If a man steal, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox, and four sheep for the sheep, </span>without mentioning “ox” or “sheep” at the beginning of the verse.
The Gemara objects: It is not possible for the verse to have been written this way, as <span class="gemarra-regular">if the Merciful One had written </span>it in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say: </span>A thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he steals two </span>animals, an ox and a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughters them </span>both. The Gemara responds: One could not interpret the verse in this manner, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And slaughter it.” </span>The singular pronoun “it” is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the slaughter of only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that a thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he steals both </span>of these animals, an ox and a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells them </span>both. The Gemara rejects this suggestion in a similar manner: This interpretation is also not possible, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Or sell it,” </span>which is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the sale of only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>animal.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>a different interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that a thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">steals two </span>animals, an ox and a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughters one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">and sells </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one. </span>The Gemara rejects this suggestion as well: This interpretation is impossible, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written:</span> “And slaughter it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sell it.” </span>The term “or” indicates that only one of these two actions results in paying the penalty.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But still, </span>had the verse been worded without mentioning an ox or sheep at the start, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say: </span>A thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he steals two </span>animals, an ox and a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughters one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">and leaves </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one, or sells one and leaves </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one. </span>It is therefore impossible to omit the words “ox” and “sheep” in the beginning of the verse, which means that these words are not superfluous.
The Gemara gives its final explanation of Rava’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, “ox” at the end </span>of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">and “sheep” in the first </span>part of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">are superfluous, due to </span>the following consideration: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Merciful One write:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If a man steal an ox and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for it, and four sheep for a sheep. Why do I </span>need the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“ox” at the end </span>of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“sheep” in the first </span>part of the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>these apparently superfluous words that for <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox and a sheep, yes, </span>a thief is obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, but for stealing <span class="gemarra-regular">other items, no, </span>he is not.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">after a thief </span>has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the thief or to the prior owner. Rather, he pays the principal amount alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where the second thief stole from the first thief <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering his item. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the second thief stole it <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, the first thief had acquired </span>the stolen item for himself as a result of the owner’s despair, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second thief pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment to the first thief, </span>who at the time of the second theft was its legal owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav was sleepy and lying down </span>to rest <span class="gemarra-regular">he said this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., he did not give it enough thought. This ruling is incorrect, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: For what reason did the Torah say that </span>if a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>a stolen ox or sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>by selling or slaughtering the animal the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">deeply entrenched in sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Sheshet analyzes Rabbi Akiva’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>did this sale of the stolen animal take place? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering his property, 

Daf 68a

<span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>is any <span class="gemarra-regular">entrenchment </span>in sin? The sale does not take effect, as it occurred before the owner despaired, which means that the thief did not in fact deepen his sin by selling the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the sale occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And if it enters your mind </span>that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does he pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment? </span>Since the animal belongs to him after the owner’s despair, in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters his own </span>animal or <span class="gemarra-regular">sells his own </span>animal.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It is possible to explain the term: Entrenched in sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The thief is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because he repeated </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sin, </span>i.e., he sinned a second time by going through the motions of the sale, regardless of the fact the sale was not legally binding. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too,</span> one can say that the thief is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">because he repeated </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sin.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter it or sell it” </span>(Exodus 21:37). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as slaughter </span>is an act <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be undone, so too </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>referred to here is an act <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be undone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>is a sale irreversible? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>this sale occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair</span> of recovering his stolen animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">why can it not be undone? </span>Since the thief’s sale of the animal before the owner’s despair is ineffective, the sale is easily undone. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be speaking about a case where the thief sold the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And if it enters your mind </span>that a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>a stolen item after the owner’s despair, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does he pay the fourfold or fivefold payment</span> for slaughtering or selling the animal at this point? <span class="gemarra-regular">He slaughters his own </span>animal or <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells his own</span> animal. Apparently, a thief does not acquire the stolen item after the owner’s despair.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The explanation for this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Naḥman said </span>in reference to a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. Rav Naḥman said that when that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> speaks of a sale that cannot be undone, this <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes one who transferred </span>ownership of the animal to another in a temporary manner, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">for thirty days. Here too, </span>one can answer in the same way, that it <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes one who transferred </span>ownership of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for thirty days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Accordingly, if one sold the animal permanently, even if the sale was performed before the owner despaired and is therefore not legally binding, he is nevertheless required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole it </span>from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the principal </span>to the first thief. This is because one who steals from a thief does not pay the double payment, as the mishna teaches.
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from the purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the purchaser, who has become the new owner of the animal. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered it, and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole </span>the slaughtered animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment but only the principal, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who steals from a thief does not pay the double payment.
The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle clause: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and stole it </span>from the purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the purchaser.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>did this sale occur? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, why does </span>the second thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the purchaser? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there anyone who says that a change in possession </span>of a stolen item, i.e., when it leaves the possession of the thief and enters the possession of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>the additional factor of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, </span>causes the one who has it to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item? There is no such opinion. Therefore, the so-called purchaser of the animal does not become its owner, as the sale is invalid. This should be considered as a case of one who steals from a thief, and consequently there should be no double payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is obvious </span>that the sale occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And if it enters your mind </span>that a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>a stolen item after the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, why </span>should the first thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment? </span>After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is his own </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that he sold, </span>having acquired it immediately upon the owner’s despair.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole it </span>from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the principal </span>to the first thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, </span>as the Gemara just established. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>causes the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second</span> thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay only the principal? </span>After the owner has despaired of recovering his item, the thief becomes the owner of the item, and the second thief should have to pay him double payment for stealing his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that the text of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is accurate? But </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole</span> an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and stole </span>the slaughtered animal, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the principal </span>to the first thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there anyone who says that </span>a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>brought about by <span class="gemarra-regular">an action does not </span>cause the thief to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item? There is no such opinion; the thief certainly becomes the owner of the animal after slaughtering it. Consequently, the second thief should have to pay the double payment to the thief for stealing his slaughtered animal. It must therefore be concluded that the text of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> has been corrupted and must be reformulated.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, actually the entire</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to the stage <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And </span>you must <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause with </span>that stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle clause, and </span>reverse the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle clause with </span>that stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause, and say like this: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and stole it </span>from the purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the principal </span>to the purchaser, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a change in possession without </span>the additional factor of owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair does not </span>cause one to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the item.
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole</span> an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another came and stole </span>the slaughtered animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first</span> thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the first thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the first thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it through the physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>brought about by <span class="gemarra-regular">an action, </span>i.e., slaughter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Actually, do not reverse </span>the middle and last clauses of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. With regard to the difficult <span class="gemarra-regular">last clause, it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, who say: </span>Even if an item has undergone a physical <span class="gemarra-regular">change, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place, </span>i.e., a stolen item remains the property of the owner. A thief never attains ownership of it, even if it undergoes a physical change.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not reversed, and if it is referring to the stage after the owner’s despair, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause and the middle clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> present <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>who maintains that after the owner’s despair the item belongs entirely to the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said: Actually, the entire </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with the stage <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And with what are we dealing here, </span>in the middle clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the owners despaired </span>of recovering the item when it was already <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the possession of the <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser, but they had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>when the item was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the possession of the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief. </span>The purchaser is considered the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> after the despair occurred, <span class="gemarra-regular">there were </span>two factors in play, both the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair and a change in possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The combination of these two factors effects acquisition of the item on behalf of the purchaser.
Rav Zevid continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not say </span>that in the middle clause the reason the owner’s item is acquired by another is only <span class="gemarra-regular">because we require </span>two factors, i.e., the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair and change of possession. Rather, even </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair by itself, </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired by the thief, </span>in accordance with Rav’s opinion that despair alone effects acquisition on behalf of the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Nevertheless, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> chose a case in which both of these factors are present <span class="gemarra-regular">because you will not find a case in which both of them, the first thief and the second thief, pay </span>a penalty <span class="gemarra-regular">except in such </span>a case. The first thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment, and the second thief pays the double payment. Had the owner despaired before the sale, the first thief would have been considered the owner and would therefore be exempt from the additional payment.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells </span>a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, despite the fact that the sale is invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from this payment. 
The two <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> explain the reasons for their respective rulings. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>with regard to the fourfold or fivefold payment: “And slaughter it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sell it” </span>(Exodus 21:37), <span class="gemarra-regular">and he has sold it. </span>There <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if the sale occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">before despair, </span>and there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if it takes place <span class="gemarra-regular">after despair.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheshet says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">his liability is </span>in effect only if he sells the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, when his action, </span>i.e., the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective. But </span>if he sells it <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, when his action is not effective, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that the sale be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the slaughter, </span>as they are mentioned together, and <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he slaughters the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">his action is effective.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say </span>he is exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did the Torah say that </span>a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who slaughtered or sold </span>a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the fourfold or fivefold payment? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he has become entrenched in sin </span>by slaughtering or selling the animal he stole.
Rav Sheshet analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span> did this sale, referred to by Rabbi Akiva, occur? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>it possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>is any <span class="gemarra-regular">entrenchment </span>in sin here? A sale before the owner’s despair is invalid, which means there is no deepening of his earlier sin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not</span> the case that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>referring to a sale <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair? Rava said: </span>This is not a proof, as one can explain that the thief is entrenched in sin <span class="gemarra-regular">because he repeated </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sin, </span>i.e. sinned a second time, by his act of sale, regardless of the fact that the sale is invalid.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And slaughter it or sell it” </span>(Exodus 21:37). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as slaughter </span>is an act <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be undone, so too </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>referred to here is an act <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be undone. </span>The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>did this sale take place? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span> the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering his stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">why can it not be undone? </span>The thief’s sale of the animal is invalid before the owner’s despair, and therefore the sale is easily undone. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be referring to a sale that took place <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment only if the animal is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. Rav Naḥman </span>rejected this proof, as he <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as serving to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude one who transferred </span>ownership of the animal temporarily, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">for thirty days.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar also holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the liability </span>of a thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment applies if he sells it <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering his stolen animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Elazar says: </span>

Daf 68b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Know that an ordinary </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft is </span>assumed to result in <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner’s despai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of recovering the stolen item. In other words, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, one may assume that the victim of theft has despaired of recovering his item.
The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Torah stated </span>that if a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal he had stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>at the time the thief sold the animal, in which case the sale is invalid, and there should be no fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not because we say that an ordinary </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft is </span>assumed to result in <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner’s despair </span>of recovering the stolen item? This concludes the statement of Rabbi Elazar, which clearly indicates that there is no fourfold or fivefold payment if the animal is sold before the owner’s despair.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s assumption: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the Torah obligates the thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the owner has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>at the time of the sale, despite the fact that the sale is invalid, as Rav Naḥman stated.
In response to this question the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot enter your mind, </span>as Rabbi Elazar maintains that the juxtaposition of slaughtering and selling in the verse that states: “And slaughter it or sell it,” teaches that the thief’s sale of the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as slaughter </span>is a matter in <span class="gemarra-regular">which his action was effective, so too, </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>the animal is one in <span class="gemarra-regular">which his action was effective, </span>i.e., the sale is valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the sale occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>sense were his actions <span class="gemarra-regular">effective?</span>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the Torah requires the fourfold or fivefold payment only in the specific case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal is sold after <span class="gemarra-regular">we heard that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of its recovery. The Sages respond to this and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot enter your mind, </span>since, as explained above, the thief’s sale of the animal must be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of it. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>the animal even if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, so too, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>it applies even if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, </span>before it is known that the owner has despaired of recovering the animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said to </span>Rabbi Elazar: The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing a human being</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., kidnapping, <span class="gemarra-regular">proves </span>that your reasoning is incorrect. The Torah states: “And he who steals a man and sells him or if he is found in his hand, he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16). In this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no owner’s despair, </span>as no one ever despairs of his own freedom. Consequently, the thief’s sale of the person he kidnapped is invalid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the Torah states that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive the death penalty for selling him. One can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>from this question <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds </span>that if the thief sells the stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
§ The Gemara asks: If the thief sells the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Reish Lakish says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the animal is sold <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span> the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair or after </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. Reish Lakish says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">liability is </span>in effect only if he sells the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, but after </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>there is no liability, because the thief has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the animal by virtue of the owner’s despair, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore it is <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and consecrated </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and subsequently slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the owner of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>The Torah states: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). The word “neighbor” excludes the case of one who steals a consecrated item from the Temple treasury. Since there is no double payment to the Temple treasury there can be no fourfold or fivefold payment either, as the fourfold or fivefold payment is considered an addition to, not a replacement of, of the double payment (see 75a). Therefore, a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment to the Temple treasury for slaughtering one of its animals.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>did the events described in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> occur? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>they happened <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, is </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>at all? A thief cannot consecrate a stolen item before the owner despairs of recovering it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one’s house belongs to him, so too, anything </span>that one consecrates must <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore a thief cannot consecrate a stolen item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span> that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with events that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span> the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair. And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment is that he consecrated </span>the animal, on the grounds <span class="gemarra-regular">that when he slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered consecrated </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consecrate </span>the animal before <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he would pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. And if it enters your mind that </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the animal for the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>would he have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay? </span>At that point it is <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters or his own </span>animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells.</span>
Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we dealing here? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case that occurred before the owner’s despair, and it is not the thief who consecrated the animal, as he cannot do so. Rather, we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the owner consecrated the animal </span>while it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the thief’s possession.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>in this situation? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of recovering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither of them is able to consecrate </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the thief, cannot consecrate the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it does not belong to him; and that </span>one, the owner, cannot consecrate it, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not in his possession. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>an answer on behalf of Reish Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">He stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pious ones [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzenuin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who acted not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 5:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">The pious ones would set aside </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">coin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: Anything that was picked from this </span>vine by passersby <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be desacralized onto these coins. </span>This mishna is referring to a grapevine in its fourth year after planting. The grapes on this vine must be either eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed with money that is then taken to Jerusalem and spent on food. The fruit may not be eaten outside Jerusalem without being redeemed. The pious ones were concerned that a passerby might help himself to some of their grapes, thereby transgressing a prohibition. Therefore, they would redeem any of their grapes that might be picked and eaten by passersby. Evidently, these pious ones were of the opinion that the owner of a stolen item can redeem it despite the fact that it is no longer in his possession. Likewise, they would say, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, that an owner of a stolen item can consecrate it even though it is no longer in his possession.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Reish Lakish’s explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that it is discussing a case where the owner of the animal consecrated it after it was stolen: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the principal </span>amount, i.e., the stolen animal itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">has returned to the owner. </span>By consecrating the animal, the owner has exercised his ownership of it, and it is therefore considered to have been returned to him at that point. The thief should therefore not be required to pay the double payment, as a thief is liable for double payment only when the stolen item is in his possession at the time of the trial, as it states: “The theft shall be found in his hand” (Exodus 22:3).
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stood in judgment </span>and was found guilty of theft before the owner consecrated the animal. Consequently, the liability to pay the double payment preceded the owner’s consecration of his property.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this trial of the thief? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> it refers to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the members of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the animal back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say that the thief is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>because the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>the animal before it was slaughtered? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if he did not consecrate it </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">should also not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara elaborates. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava says: </span>If the court tells a thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the stolen animal back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the owner and instead the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">has issued a definitive ruling in </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, and he </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is considered a robber, and a robber does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>The difference between a thief, concerning whom the Torah prescribes the double payment and the fourfold or fivefold payment, and a robber, who does not incur these obligations, is that a thief acts stealthily, whereas a robber brazenly uses force to take an item from its owner. Once a court has obligated a thief to make restitution and he has defied this sentence, he is considered a robber, and therefore the fourfold or fivefold payment and its atonement are not applicable to him. 

Daf 69a

Rava continues: But if the court says to the thief only: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are obligated to give </span>the stolen animal back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its owner, without actually ordering him to pay, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">has not issued a definitive ruling in </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, he is still </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>rather than a robber.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not a challenge to the ruling of Reish Lakish. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they say to him </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are obligated to give </span>the stolen animal back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its owner. Consequently, he remains categorized as a thief.
§ The Gemara returns to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of recovering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither of them is able to consecrate </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the thief, cannot consecrate it <span class="gemarra-regular">because it does not belong to him, and that </span>one, the owner, cannot consecrate it <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not in his possession. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is invariably in accordance with the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed mishna, </span>i.e., a mishna that states a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> without citing it in the name of a particular Sage?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> there is a mishna of this kind (<span class="it-text">Ma’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 5:1) that contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard in its fourth year, they would demarcate it with clods of earth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bikzozot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> placed around it on the ground, to alert people that they may not eat or derive any benefit from its grapes without redeeming them. The Gemara interrupts its quotation of the mishna to explain: This particular <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguishing mark </span>of earth is used because a vineyard in its fourth year is <span class="gemarra-regular">like earth: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">earth there is </span>permission to derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from it </span>through its cultivation, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it has been redeemed </span>by means of coins, it is likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to benefit from it.</span>
The Gemara resumes its citation from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a grapevine <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span> is demarcated <span class="gemarra-regular">with potsherds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarsit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> placed around it, to alert people that its grapes may not be eaten nor may any benefit be derived from them at all (see Leviticus 19:23). The Gemara explains: This particular <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguishing mark </span>is used because <span class="it-text">orla</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">like potsherds: Just as no benefit </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from potsherd, so too, no benefit </span>may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="it-text">orla</span>.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">of graves </span>is demarcated <span class="gemarra-regular">with lime</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to notify people that the demarcated area is ritually impure and will impart impurity to those who pass over it. The Gemara explains: The reason this particular <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguishing mark </span>is used is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> lime is <span class="gemarra-regular">white, like bones. </span>The mishna further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolves </span>the lime in water <span class="gemarra-regular">and pours </span>it out around the gravesite. The Gemara explains: This is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that </span>the lime <span class="gemarra-regular">should be whiter </span>than in its non-dissolved form.
The Gemara resumes the citation from the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that vineyards of the fourth year and of <span class="it-text">orla</span> require demarcation, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? During the Sabbatical </span>Year. The Gemara explains: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>all fruit that grows during that year may be taken by anyone (see Leviticus 25:5–6), as in that year all fruit is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>property.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But during the other years of </span>the Sabbatical <span class="gemarra-regular">cycle, </span>when anyone who takes the grapes of another is guilty of theft, there is no requirement to demarcate these vineyards. This is in accordance with the adage: <span class="gemarra-regular">Feed it to the wicked man and let him die. </span>That is, one is not required to take precautions to protect the wicked from the consequences of their own sins. Here too, there is no obligation to warn a thief that the grapes he is stealing are prohibited.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the pious ones would set aside </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">coin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: Anything that was picked from this</span> vine by passersby <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be desacralized onto these coins. </span>These pious ones maintain that the owner can desacralize the grapes despite the fact that they are no longer in his possession. Similarly, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, they would claim that an owner can consecrate a stolen item even though it is no longer in his possession. Since this opinion is cited in the mishna without being attributed to any particular Sage, Rabbi Yoḥanan should have accepted this ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Who</span> is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this practice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pious ones </span>in the mishna? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say </span>his principle that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is always in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span>mishna when it follows <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual </span>opinion; this suggestion does not alleviate the difficulty.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Wherever Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught </span>a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the corpus of <span class="gemarra-regular">our Mishna, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with his </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the case of the responsibility of the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantor </span>(see <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 173b), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the incident that occurred in the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzaidan </span>(see <span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 74a), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the dispute with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">evidence </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">final </span>disagreement (see <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 31a). Consequently, even if the opinion of the pious ones was cited by Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Yoḥanan should have accepted it as authoritative.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>in explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: When quoting the declaration of the pious ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not say </span>in the past tense: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that was picked from this </span>vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: Anything that will be picked from this </span>vine shall be desacralized onto these coins. In other words, the desacralizing is performed before the fruit is picked, while it is still in the full possession of the owner of the vine.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say such </span>a ruling? Could Rabbi Yoḥanan agree to this reformulation of the declaration of the pious ones? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: The pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, </span>i.e., their opinions are equivalent? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Dosa says </span>that this declaration is formulated in the past tense, as: Anything <span class="gemarra-regular">that was picked.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>In the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning the homeowner,</span> i.e., the owner of a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">stands and says: Anything that the poor will pick today </span>that is not rightfully theirs <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>hereby <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>property. The poor are entitled to glean leftover grain from a field after it is harvested (Leviticus 23:22). Yet there are many <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> involved in determining what produce they are entitled to take, and not all poor people are learned enough to know these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. Consequently, there will inevitably be poor people who will take a certain amount of grain to which they are not entitled. For this reason, the owner of the field should relinquish, in advance, ownership over whatever the poor might unlawfully take.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: </span>This is not the correct practice. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">toward evenin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the owner should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Anything that the poor picked </span>today that is not rightfully theirs <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>hereby <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>property. Since Rabbi Yoḥanan stated that the opinions of the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa are the same, this indicates that the declaration of the pious ones was in the past tense, which means that they permitted redemption of fourth-year produce after it was already stolen. If so, the question remains: Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept the ruling of the pious ones as authoritative? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Dosa with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>According to this new version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Rabbi Dosa does not permit the owner of an item to exercise any control over it after it has been stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do you reverse the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> to avoid a contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan? It is better to <span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span> himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span>that he actually stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">The pious ones and Rabbi Yehuda said the same thing, </span>and leave the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> intact.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says: There is no alternative, as </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>do otherwise than <span class="gemarra-regular">to reverse the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>that would mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that in this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it teaches that Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that there is a principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And we have heard </span>elsewhere <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yehuda generally does not accept</span> the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Demai</span> 7:4): 

Daf 69b

In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from among the Samaritans [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kutim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if there is reason to suspect that <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes were not separated, and he cannot separate them before the start of Shabbat, he acts as follows. If there are one hundred <span class="it-text">log</span> of wine in the barrels, he <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that I will separate in the future are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the mandated average measure of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is one-fiftieth; <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="it-text">log</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe; </span>and a tenth of the remainder, <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="it-text">log</span>, are <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And he desacralize</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the second tithe that he will separate in the future by transferring its sanctity onto money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may drink </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately, </span>relying on the separation that he will perform later. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit </span>one from doing so. The objection of these three Sages is presumably that this arrangement relies on the principle of retroactive designation, as at the time of the declaration the identity of the particular portions of wine that will be <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes is unknown, and these Sages do not accept this principle. It is apparent from this mishna that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept retroactive designation, and therefore he cannot be the one who said that the owner of the field may issue his declaration of relinquishment in the morning.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Ultimately, why do you reverse the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that contains the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Dosa? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>due to the contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda </span>and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda. Now too, </span>although you have reversed the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, a similar problem remains, as there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>due to the contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As you said, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: Do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that was picked </span>from this vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that will be picked from this </span>vine shall be desacralized onto these coins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan here <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation. But </span>it is established that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Brothers who divided </span>property received as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as purchasers of land <span class="gemarra-regular">they must return </span>the portions <span class="gemarra-regular">to each other in the Jubilee </span>Year, at which point they may redistribute the property. This demonstrates that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold that it is retroactively clarified that each brother’s portion was designated for him directly upon their father’s death, but rather all the land was considered joint property until the brothers traded or bought their respective portions from each other at the time of the distribution of the estate.
In light of this objection, the Gemara retracts its previous assertion that Rabbi Yoḥanan reformulated the declaration of the pious ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the pious ones <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>declared in the past tense: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that was picked </span>from this vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins, i.e., the desacralizing took place after the grapes were stolen. If so, the question remains: Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept the opinion of the pious ones, but instead ruled that the owner of an item cannot consecrate it after it has been stolen?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan found a different unattributed </span>mishna, which contradicts the opinion of the pious ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the mishna here (62b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">after a thief </span>has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the thief or to the prior owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not pay to the first thief, as </span>the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it was stolen from the house of the man; </span>if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), which indicates that the double payment applies in the case of an item “stolen from the house of the man,” i.e., from the owner’s jurisdiction, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>to an item stolen from <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief’s house. But let him pay </span>the double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner, </span>as it presumably still belonged to the owner when the second thief stole it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>this that a stolen item is not under the full jurisdiction of either the owner or the thief? It is not under the jurisdiction of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the first thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it does not belong to him, and </span>it is not under the jurisdiction of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not in his possession. </span>Therefore, neither of them can consecrate the stolen item.
The Gemara asks: Granted that this unattributed mishna disagrees with the mishna that cites the pious ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">but what did you see </span>that led you to <span class="gemarra-regular">follow that unattributed </span>mishna, the one that discusses the double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">act, </span>i.e., rule, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with this unattributed </span>mishna, which states the practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of the pious ones.</span> On what basis did he choose one mishna over the other?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan followed the mishna that discusses the double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">supports it: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as one’s house is in his possession, so too anything </span>that one consecrates must <span class="gemarra-regular">be in his possession, </span>excluding items that have been stolen from him.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, </span>i.e., their rulings are identical, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the pious ones accept </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Dosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but Rabbi Dosa does not accept </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the pious ones.</span>
Abaye elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The pious ones accept </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Dosa, </span>for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Sages instituted an ordinance for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span>to prevent him from eating unredeemed fourth-year grapes, by allowing the owner to desacralize produce that is no longer in his possession, does it <span class="gemarra-regular">need to be said </span>that they did so for the sake of innocent <span class="gemarra-regular">poor people, </span>as Rabbi Dosa claimed? Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa does not accept </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the pious ones, </span>as he says: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>for the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">poor people that the Sages instituted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinance; but the Sages did not institute an ordinance for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span>in line with the aforementioned principle: Feed it to the wicked man and let him die.
In a similar vein, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say </span>that there is a fundamental difference between the cases of fourth-year produce and gleanings taken by the poor, as one could claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the ruling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pious ones? It is Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rabbi Meir say </span>that second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe is property </span>belonging to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> rather than the possession of the one who separated it from his produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even so, with regard to redemption </span>of the second tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One establishes it in his possession? As it is written </span>concerning the second tithe: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it its fifth part” </span>(Leviticus 27:31). 
Although according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, second tithe does not belong to the owner of the produce from which it was separated, nevertheless, with regard to redemption <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One </span>does distinguish between a stranger and one who separated it from his produce, as the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">refers to </span>the second tithe as <span class="gemarra-regular">“his tithe” and </span>thereby decrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>the owner of the crop from which it is separated, can redeem it by <span class="gemarra-regular">adding one-fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to its value, but no one else can do so. This indicates that although second-tithe produce is not in fact owned by the person, the Torah treats him as the owner of the produce.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fourth-year vineyard as well, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>many of its <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verbal analogy between <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe </span>and fourth-year fruit, based on the use of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“holy” </span>in the context of fourth-year fruit and <span class="gemarra-regular">“holy” </span>in the context of second tithe. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written here, </span>concerning fourth-year fruit trees: “And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">holy, for giving praise </span>to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy” </span>(Leviticus 27:30).
From this analogy it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“holy” that is written in connection to </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, even though it is property </span>belonging to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Most High, with regard to redemption the Merciful One establishes it in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">jurisdiction </span>of the one who separated it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>in the context of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“holy” that is written in connection to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth-year vineyard, even though it is not his property, </span>as it belongs to the Most High, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to desacralizing the Merciful One establishes it in </span>the vineyard owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">jurisdiction. </span>
The effect of this determination is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">is in his jurisdiction it is not his </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">he is able to desacralize it. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason the owner of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is able to desacralize </span>the fruit even after a thief has taken it. Even in normal circumstances when one desacralizes his fourth-year fruit he is desacralizing fruit that does not belong to him. Consequently, there is no novelty in the ruling that one can desacralize fruit even after it has been taken by a thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to gleanings </span>of the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the extra sheaves that the poor people inadvertently take <span class="gemarra-regular">are the property of </span>the owner of the field, it may be claimed that only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>those sheaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are in his possession, </span>i.e., they have not been taken by anyone else, <span class="gemarra-regular">can he relinquish </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>them, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession he cannot relinquish </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>them. Consequently, the pious ones, who permitted redemption of fourth-year produce after it had been stolen, would not necessarily agree with Rabbi Dosa, who allowed the relinquishment of stolen sheaves.
In a similar vein, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pious ones? It is Rabbi Dosa. </span>I would have said this <span class="gemarra-regular">so that an unattributed mishna should not </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan. And </span>the reason why this would have resolved the difficulty is that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span>

Daf 70a

<span class="gemarra-regular">did not say </span>to apply his principle, that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is always in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span>mishna, in a case where the mishna expresses the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>Sage. According to this interpretation Rabbi Yoḥanan does not rule in accordance with the mishna, due to the fact that it represents the opinion of an individual Sage, Rabbi Dosa. Rather, he follows the majority opinion. Yet now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, it cannot be claimed that they are one and the same Sage. Consequently, the ruling of the mishna is evidently accepted by at least two Sages, and therefore the difficulty from the mishna cannot be resolved by assigning it to a single Sage.
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: One cannot write a document of authorization [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to assign another to collect a debt or a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">of movable property </span>on his behalf. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a principle stated <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owners have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of recovering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither of them is able to consecrate </span>it: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the thief, cannot consecrate the item <span class="gemarra-regular">because it does not belong to him, and that </span>one, the owner, cannot consecrate it <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not in his possession. </span>The granting of authority to collect a debt involves the transfer of ownership of the item or money from the owner to the collector; otherwise the debtor could refuse to convey it to the collector. In the case of movable property, as it is being held by another, it is not in the possession of the owner; just as the owner cannot consecrate this item he cannot transfer ownership of it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who state </span>a different version of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a say: One cannot write a document of authorization for </span>the collection of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property that </span>the bailee or debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has denied </span>owing. The Gemara infers: According to this version, the only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>the document cannot be written is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the bailee or debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">has denied </span>owing the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a document written under these circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">has the appearance of falsehood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the purported owner is transferring ownership of an item over which his own ownership is in doubt. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the bailee or debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">did not deny </span>owing the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">one can write </span>a document of authorization.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a state </span>another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to this kind of document: <span class="gemarra-regular">A document of authorization in which it is not written: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">take legal action </span>against so-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>possession of the owed property <span class="gemarra-regular">and collect it </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">for yourself, has no substance, </span>i.e., it is not a valid document. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the other </span>party, the bailee or debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">can say </span>to the collector who presents a document without this clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am not legally answerable to you; </span>I am willing to deal only with the person to whom the item is owed. To avoid this situation, the authorization document must transfer actual ownership of the item to the collector, who is now claiming it for himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And if it is written </span>in the document that the owner transferred ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half</span> of the item to the collector, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a third or a quarter </span>of it, this is sufficient. The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the bailee or debtor must <span class="gemarra-regular">relate </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment, </span>i.e., engage in litigation with the collector, <span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> or third or quarter of the item that has been transferred to the collector, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">relate </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment concerning all of it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: If </span>the collector who is empowered by the authorization <span class="gemarra-regular">seized </span>the item he collected and kept it for himself, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take it away from him, </span>as the owner transferred ownership of the item to him in the document of authorization, as explained above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>disagreed with Ameimar and <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Since </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote to </span>the collector: <span class="gemarra-regular">I accept upon myself anything that develops as a result of </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">legal process</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has </span>in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered </span>the collector <span class="gemarra-regular">an agen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to act on his behalf, and therefore the agent cannot seize the item for himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there is </span>another opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that states: </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">renders the </span>collector <span class="gemarra-regular">a partner </span>in the collected item, transferring ownership of half of it to him while maintaining ownership over the other half. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>between this opinion and that of Rav Ashi? The Gemara answers: The difference is whether the collector has the power <span class="gemarra-regular">to seize half </span>of the collected item for himself. If he is merely an agent of the owner, he cannot seize anything; if he is a partner he can seize up to half. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the collector his <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, </span>and therefore this agent may not seize any portion of the collected item for himself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists a series of cases in which a thief is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold penalty. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, also <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of the same witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">or based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two other </span>witnesses, he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for idol worship, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur, </span>he pay s the fourfold or fivefold payment. Although his sale or slaughter in these circumstances involved a sin, he is not liable to receive the death penalty for the sale and must consequently pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. 
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward his father died </span>and he inherited his father’s estate either on his own or in partnership with his brothers, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he consecrated </span>it, he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>
In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered it, </span>not for the purpose of eating its meat, but to use it <span class="gemarra-regular">for medicinal purpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to </span>feed the meat to <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs, </span>and likewise a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who slaughters </span>the animal to eat its meat <span class="gemarra-regular">but it was found to be an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who slaughters a non-sacred </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon exempts </span>the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">in these </span>last <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cases, as he maintains that the legal status of an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if two witnesses testify about the theft of an animal and two others testify about its slaughter or sale, the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>in his exposition of the verse: “Based on the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15).
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>the thief would be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment, as <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this verse teaches that witnesses’ testimony must refer to an entire <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and not part of a matter? </span>In the case discussed by the mishna the second set of witnesses testifies only that this man slaughtered or sold an ox or sheep, not that he stole it, and therefore their testimony alone would not render the thief liable to pay anything. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 2:4) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When father Ḥalaft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> went to study Torah with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, and some say </span>that he said: When <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri </span>went to study <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah with father </span>

Daf 70b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥalafta, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>the following in the course of their discussion of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of possession. 
If one has been in possession of real estate for three years, this serves as proof of his claim that he is the legal owner. One who is able to prove uninterrupted possession for the necessary period is not required to produce documentary evidence of his legal title to the property. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri or father Ḥalafta asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one harvested and <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the produce of a field that he claims as his own the <span class="gemarra-regular">first yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the three years required for establishing possession of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>witnesses, and subsequently ate the produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>year <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of two </span>other witnesses, and finally ate the produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>year <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>other witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Can the three testimonies combine to establish full testimony that he ate the produce of three years, thereby confirming his ownership of the field?
Rabbi Ḥalafta <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, or vice versa: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>considered to establish <span class="gemarra-regular">presumptive ownership </span>by the one who ate the produce. The other Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I too say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, but Rabbi Akiva disputes </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, as Rabbi Akiva would say: </span>The Torah requires that witnesses must testify with regard to a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">matter and not part of a matter. </span>Since there must be testimony concerning consumption of the produce over three years, and each set of witnesses establishes only that it took place for one year, their separate testimonies do not combine. If so, the mishna is apparently not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara rejects this assertion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva concede </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>So-and-so <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed </span>a certain woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>other witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Someone else subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in sexual intercourse </span>with that same woman, this is proof that the act of intercourse was adulterous? 
The reason for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that even though the witnesses </span>testifying about the <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse require the witnesses </span>who testify about the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal, </span>i.e., the testimony of the second set of witnesses is meaningless without the testimony of the first witnesses, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the witnesses </span>testifying about the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal do not require the witnesses</span> who testify about the <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse, </span>i.e., their testimony by itself establishes a halakhic status, <span class="gemarra-regular">we call </span>the testimony of each pair a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">matter.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the same logic applies in the case of a thief who steals an animal and subsequently slaughters or sells it: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though the witnesses </span>who testify about the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter require the </span>testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>about the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>in order for their testimony to have any halakhic significance, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the witnesses </span>testifying about the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft do not require the </span>testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>who testify about the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, </span>as their testimony alone establishes that person as a thief who is liable to pay the double payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">we call </span>the testimony of each pair a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">matter.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis,</span> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva that the Torah stipulates that testimony must be about <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter and not half of a matter, </span>the term “matter” (Deuteronomy 19:15) serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? </span>The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case involving testimony that a girl has reached majority, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he saw <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair on <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>lower <span class="gemarra-regular">back</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he saw <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair on <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>lower <span class="gemarra-regular">abdomen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A girl is considered to have reached maturity when she has two pubic hairs. In this case, two witnesses separately testify that they have each seen one hair, and therefore each testimony is halakhically meaningless on its own. The Rabbis derive from the verse that these testimonies do not combine.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case each testimony is obviously invalid, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">half a matter and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">half a testimony. </span>Not only does each testimony refer to one hair, which is half a matter, it is submitted by one witness, which is half a testimony. Consequently, it is obvious that the girl is not considered of age in this case.
The Gemara therefore rejects this explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> the Rabbis maintain that the term “matter” serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that they saw <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair on a girl’s <span class="gemarra-regular">back, and two </span>other witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that they saw <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on her </span>lower <span class="gemarra-regular">abdomen. </span>In this case the testimony of either set of witnesses concerns only one hair, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>essentially <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor and those </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, each testimony concerns only half of a matter.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that in this case he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: When it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pick off a fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for yourself from my fig tree </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>through performing this act <span class="gemarra-regular">your stolen </span>animal shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired by me. </span>Since the act of acquisition of the animal involved the type of Shabbat desecration for which one is liable to receive the death penalty, the thief is exempt from the monetary obligations he would ordinarily incur from this act, i.e., the fourfold or fivefold payment to the animal’s prior owner. This is in accordance with the principle that one who commits two or more transgressions by means of a single act, both of which entail punishment, is exempt from the lesser punishment.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>questioning this explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But since, if </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">would bring a legal claim against </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">before us, </span>to force him to deliver the animal acquired by means of picking the fig, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">would not say to </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>him the animal you owe him, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty for his desecration of Shabbat, this shows that <span class="gemarra-regular">the sale is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>at all. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> would not call this exchange a sale and this interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be correct.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Pappa said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Throw your stolen </span>animal from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">into my </span>enclosed <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, and your stolen </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">be acquired by me. </span>One can acquire an item if it is placed on his property. In this case, when the thief places the animal on the purchaser’s property he moves it from the public domain into the private domain, which is a desecration of Shabbat that entails the death penalty. Consequently, he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: If this is the correct explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose</span> opinion is the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who says: </span>An item <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">airspace </span>of a certain area <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>as though it were <span class="gemarra-regular">at res</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in that area.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that an item in the airspace of a certain area is not considered as though it were at rest in that area, <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">reache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>airspace <span class="gemarra-regular">of the courtyard </span>of the purchaser’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>he has acquired it, as one can acquire items that are in the airspace of his courtyard just like those on its ground, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>moving an item from one domain to another on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for Shabbat desecration <span class="gemarra-regular">until it reaches the ground. </span>Since the thief’s monetary liability is not simultaneous with his incurring of the death penalty, he would not be exempt from payment.
The Gemara answers: It is possible that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis as well, as one can explain that it is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>which the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your stolen </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be acquired by me until it rests </span>on the ground. In that case, the acquisition of the animal and the Shabbat desecration are simultaneous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>it is possible to explain the <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rami bar Ḥama </span>did, that the animal was acquired through the picking of a fig on Shabbat. And the objection raised earlier, that this act should not be considered a sale at all, is incorrect. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah prohibits </span>one to bring as an offering an animal given as the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this prohibition applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the man in question <span class="gemarra-regular">engaged in intercourse with his own mother, </span>which is a capital offense. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if she</span> would bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a legal claim before us, demanding </span>the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee, <span class="gemarra-regular">would we say to him: Arise and pay her </span>the animal? The court would not say this, as the monetary liability was incurred simultaneously with the commission of a capital crime.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though if she </span>brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a legal claim </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">him demanding </span>the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go and pay her, </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if </span>he does <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to her it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>to a prostitute, it cannot be used as an offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of the acquisition of the animal through picking a fig, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though with regard to payment, if </span>the purchaser would bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a legal claim before us </span>against the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">seeking </span>to force him to deliver the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">we would not say to him: Go pay, </span>

Daf 71a

and <span class="gemarra-regular">even so, since </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">transfers ownership to </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale, </span>and he is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur </span>he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>questioning this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is he liable to pay it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Although there is no </span>penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">execution </span>for slaughtering on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">nevertheless there is </span>the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we maintain that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">flogged and </span>obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for the same act.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> in response: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: </span>One is sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">flogged and </span>obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for the same action.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>which is a capital offense, he should be obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, whereas the mishna (74b) states that in this case he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that one is sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">flogged and</span> obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for the same act, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not hold </span>that one is sentenced to the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for the same act, this is incorrect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it correct to say that Rabbi Meir does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>maintain that one can be sentenced to the death penalty and to pay for the same act? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for idol worship, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole an ox that is</span> sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">stoned, </span>from which it is prohibited to derive any benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he slaughtered it, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold </span>payment; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis exempt</span> him from this payment. Apparently Rabbi Meir maintains that one can be held liable for monetary payment and for capital punishment for the same act, e.g., slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idol worship.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Stand <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, i.e., this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should not be understood in a straightforward manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated concerning it: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Ela and the entire grou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> of disciples of Rabbi Yoḥanan also <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a thief who <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>the stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the agency of <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> person, i.e., he instructed another to slaughter it, and that agent did so on Shabbat or for idolatrous purposes. The thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment because he himself did not commit a capital offense.
The Gemara asks: How can it be that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if another person slaughters the stolen animal for him? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes liable? </span>
The Gemara provides several reasons why in the case of fourfold or fivefold payment it is possible for the thief to be liable for another’s actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it” </span>(Exodus 21:37), thereby juxtaposing the two acts of slaughtering and selling. It is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>there is liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment through <span class="gemarra-regular">selling, </span>which by definition is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of another </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>there is liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>when it is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of another </span>party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches: </span>The word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>in the phrase: “And slaughter it or sell it,” serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the agen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> slaughters or sells the animal at the behest of the thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Ḥizkiyya teaches: </span>The separate word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for” [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taḥat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>in the phrase: “He shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep,” which could have been avoided by using the mere prefix of the letter <span class="it-text">beit</span>, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the agent </span>slaughters the animal on behalf of the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra objects to this </span>explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there anything </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable, and </span>if his <span class="gemarra-regular">agent performs </span>it on his behalf one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable? </span>How is it possible for an agent to have more power than the one who appointed him? Can it be that if the thief himself slaughtered the animal on Shabbat he would be exempt, whereas if he has it slaughtered by another he is liable?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: There, </span>in the case of the thief who slaughters a stolen animal on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not because he is not liable </span>that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>he is liable but he is excused from payment <span class="gemarra-regular">because he receives the greater of </span>the two punishments, i.e., execution, for desecrating Shabbat. When he appoints an agent he has no liability for desecrating Shabbat, and therefore he pays for the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>a thief who <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through </span>the agency of <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason of the Rabbis, who exempt </span>the thief from payment? The thief did not himself do any act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>are these <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said: </span>The legal status of an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that is not fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>Since slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idolatrous purposes does not render the meat fit for consumption, Rabbi Shimon rules that there is no liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>questioning this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>slaughtering for <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship and </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is </span>sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">stoned are </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that is not fit, </span>as in both of these cases it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the animal’s flesh. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>slaughtering on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is a fit slaughter. As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 14a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty for desecrating Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">his slaughter is valid </span>and the meat may be eaten.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who disagrees with that mishna and prohibits eating the meat of an animal slaughtered on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 2:3): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who cooks </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly he may eat </span>the food, but if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally he may not eat </span>it; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says:</span> If he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly he may eat </span>the food only <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the conclusion of Shabbat, </span>and if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally he may not eat </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">ever, </span>although others may partake of it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says: </span>If he cooked the food <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">may be eaten upon the conclusion of Shabbat by others </span>only, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not by him; </span>and if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally it may not be eaten ever, neither by him nor by others. </span>Slaughter, like cooking, is a desecration of Shabbat that entails the death penalty. It follows that Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar maintains that the meat of an animal intentionally slaughtered on Shabbat may never be eaten. If so, this is a slaughter that does not render the meat fit for consumption, and therefore according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar? </span>The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nasi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kodesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to you; </span>one who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as it is prohibited to eat a sacred </span>item consecrated to the Temple [<span class="it-text">kodesh</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">so too is it prohibited to eat </span>food produced though <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>that desecrates <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, perhaps the analogy should be extended: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as it is prohibited to derive benefit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a sacred </span>item, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>should it be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to derive benefit </span>from a product of <span class="gemarra-regular">an action </span>that desecrates <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“It is holy <span class="gemarra-regular">to you” </span>(Exodus 31:14), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall be yours </span>for deriving benefit. Although food cooked on Shabbat may not be eaten, it is permitted to benefit from it in other ways.
The Gemara further asks: Based on the analogy between a sacred item and the product of an action that desecrates Shabbat, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the action were performed <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>it should be prohibited to consume the product, like a sacred item. To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death”</span> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who desecrates Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>this analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>as the verse clearly is referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>one who desecrates Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span>who is not executed.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to </span>this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said </span>that the product of <span class="gemarra-regular">an action </span>that constitutes a desecration of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, and one said </span>that the product of <span class="gemarra-regular">an action </span>that constitutes a desecration of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who says </span>it is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law </span>explains <span class="gemarra-regular">as we said, </span>that the prohibition is based on the verse as interpreted by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>it is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law </span>would say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “It is holy,” </span>from which he infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It, </span>the day itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">is holy but </span>the products of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">actions are not holy, </span>and therefore they are not compared to sacred items and may be eaten by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that products of a prohibited act are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, it is for </span>

Daf 71b

<span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis exempt </span>the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment when he slaughters the animal on Shabbat, as slaughter on Shabbat does not render the meat permitted for consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that the product of a prohibited act on Shabbat may be eaten by Torah law but is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, why do the Rabbis exempt </span>the thief when he appoints an agent to slaughter the animal for him and the agent performs this action on Shabbat?
The Gemara answers: When the Rabbis exempt him from the fourfold or fivefold payment, they are not referring to the case where the thief’s agent slaughters the animal on Shabbat. Rather, they were speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of the rest </span>of the cases listed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, namely, an agent who slaughters the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for idol worship and </span>one who slaughters <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that is </span>sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">stoned.</span>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> presented above: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>granted he maintains that the legal status of an act of slaughter not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is nevertheless considered an act of slaughter. But <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment when his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters</span> the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for idol worship?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Once he slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, </span>at the very start of the act of slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has prohibited </span>the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as an animal sacrificed to idolatry. When he slaughters <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit, </span>which means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters. </span>Since deriving benefit from the animal is prohibited, it has no value; therefore, there is no ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who says </span>prior to the slaughter that only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the completion of the slaughter </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he worship </span>the idolatry. Therefore, the prohibition does not take effect until that stage, which is also when the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred.
The Gemara raises a question with regard to another of the cases of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An ox that is </span>sentenced to be <span class="gemarra-regular">stoned is an item from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit is prohibited. </span>Consequently, when a thief or his agent slaughters this animal, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters. </span>Why does Rabbi Meir obligate him to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: With what are we dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">entrusted </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to a bailee and </span>the ox fatally <span class="gemarra-regular">injured </span>someone while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the bailee’s house, and it was forewarned </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the bailee’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it was sentenced </span>to be stoned while <span class="gemarra-regular">in the bailee’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the thief then stole it from the bailee’s house and slaughtered it. Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov, and he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov, who says: Even after </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was sentence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to be stoned, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee returned it to its owners </span>before it was killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">returned. </span>Although the ox is now worthless, as no benefit may be derived from it, since the bailee returned a physically intact ox, the owner has no claim against him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Meir also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says: An item </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>elimination <span class="gemarra-regular">causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary</span> value. With regard to an item that is otherwise worthless, if its elimination causes monetary loss due to the fact that it must be replaced, it is considered to be of value. In this case, although the ox is worthless in and of itself, when the thief slaughters it he prevents the bailee from returning it intact to the owner and causes him to be obligated to pay the owner the value of the ox before it was sentenced to be stoned. Consequently, the thief must reimburse the bailee, as the ox effectively has value for that bailee.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned</span> in a mishna (74b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibilit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to replace any of them with another animal if it is lost or it dies, the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters the animal. Although one is generally not liable to pay the double payment for stealing consecrated items, Rabbi Shimon maintains that this case is different, since as a result of the animal’s theft the owner sustains a loss by being required to substitute another animal for it. Since the animal’s loss has financial ramifications for the owner apart from any inherent value it has, it has value for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Shimon holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item whose </span>elimination <span class="gemarra-regular">causes financial</span> loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: I recited </span>this <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>according to which the mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of Rav Zevid of Neharde’a, </span>and I asked him: Is it correct to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">you can establish the mishna in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon? But isn’t it taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon exempts </span>the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">in these </span>last <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cases. One can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that in all the </span>rest of the cases in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, </span>apart from these two, Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.
Rav Zevid <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No; </span>that is not the correct inference from the mishna. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>one can learn only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment in the cases mentioned immediately prior to this one, specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal in order that it should be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for medicinal purposes or for </span>feeding to <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs. </span>Therefore, it can be correct to establish the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it, and afterward his father died, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment to his father’s other heirs. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole an ox </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two partners and slaughtered it, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">to one of </span>the partners, which means that he is exempt from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment to that partner, in accordance with the principle that one who admits his own guilt is exempt from fines, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to payment to the other partner?
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: “He shall pay <span class="gemarra-regular">five oxen </span>for an ox” (Exodus 21:37), which indicates five full oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not five</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half-oxen. Or perhaps </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states “five oxen,” </span>this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">even five half-oxen </span>must be paid in a case of this kind. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states: “Five oxen,” </span>which means five full oxen, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not five half-oxen.</span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to him </span>from the mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward his father died, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. But here, since his father died </span>and the thief has inherited part of the stolen animal himself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case of one who stole from two partners <span class="gemarra-regular">and went ahead and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">to one of them, </span>i.e., to himself. In the case of the mishna he is exempt from paying the portion of the fine that is for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the other heirs their portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? With </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stood </span>against his son the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">trial, </span>and the son was convicted for the theft and slaughter of his father’s animal. In this case, the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment was established before the father’s death, and at that time the payment was five full oxen.
Rava asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the thief had <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>before the father’s death, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, according to your opinion? Would he <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be required to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? If so, rather than teaching in the latter clause </span>of the mishna (74b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole his father’s </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">make a distinction within the same </span>type of case, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>i.e., that the thief is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>in his father’s lifetime; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stand trial </span>in his father’s lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, </span>the mishna could have mentioned that case. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna has to <span class="gemarra-regular">cite the first clause, </span>which discusses one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">of his father’s and slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward his father died, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he cites the latter clause as well, </span>by means of a similar case: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole his father’s </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and his father died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold </span>the animal.
This discussion between Rava and Rav Naḥman occurred in the evening. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">morning, </span>Rav Naḥman retracted his statement and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states: “Five oxen,” and </span>this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">even five half-oxe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> are included. Rav Naḥman explained his change of mind: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that I did not say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>last <span class="gemarra-regular">night</span>

Daf 72a

is <span class="gemarra-regular">because I had not eaten ox meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, I was fasting yesterday and was unable to concentrate properly.
Rava responded to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> if the Torah requires even a partial payment of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>in which the son must pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>where he is exempt?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>where the father’s animal was stolen and slaughtered in his lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">I read about </span>this case the verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter it” </span>(Exodus 21:37), which indicates that the thief slaughtered the ox or the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely in a prohibited </span>manner. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>where the animal was slaughtered after the father’s death, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not read about </span>this case the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And slaughter it,” </span>which describes a slaughter that was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely in a prohibited </span>manner, because the animal already partially belonged to him, and his own portion of the ox was slaughtered in a permitted manner.
§ The mishna teaches: A thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who slaughters </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">but it was found to be a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and likewise a thief who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard, pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Conclude from </span>the mishna that the act <span class="gemarra-regular">of slaughtering </span>is considered to have been performed <span class="gemarra-regular">only at the end </span>of the slaughtering process.
Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>you say that the act <span class="gemarra-regular">of slaughtering </span>lasts <span class="gemarra-regular">from beginning to end, </span>i.e., the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the process, one could raise a question with regard to the case of one who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, </span>at the very start of the act of slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has prohibited </span>the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>part, it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters. </span>Since deriving benefit from the animal is prohibited, it has no value; therefore, there is no ownership.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rava, said to </span>Rav Ḥavivi in response: It is possible to explain the mishna even if one maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. As, <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">become obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?

Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if you are correct, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>according to the one who maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava, </span>concerning this question: The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered, </span>i.e., severed, <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two organs that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must be severed in ritual slaughter, </span>i.e., the trachea and the esophagus <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">simanin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], outside </span>the Temple, and <span class="gemarra-regular">finished</span> slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">them inside </span>the Temple. Therefore, the animal became prohibited with regard to deriving benefit only at the final stage of slaughter, concomitant with the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who teach </span>that the preceding exchange took place <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the following dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>ben Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">says in the name of Rabbi Levi the Elder: </span>The act of slaughtering is considered to have been <span class="gemarra-regular">performed only at the end </span>of the slaughtering process. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The act <span class="gemarra-regular">of slaughtering lasts from beginning to end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Shall we say that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds </span>that the prohibition against deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not by Torah law? </span>

Daf 72b

<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if it enters your mind </span>that it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law </span>the mishna here would be difficult, for <span class="gemarra-regular">as soon as he slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit, </span>at the very start of the act of slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has prohibited </span>the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>part it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>an animal that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to </span>Rav Ḥavivi: It is possible to explain the mishna even according to the opinion that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter, and even if one maintains that it is prohibited by Torah law to benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple. As, <span class="gemarra-regular">when does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">become obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">as well? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he performs <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">bit </span>of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to </span>Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not dismiss </span>Rav Ḥavivi’s suggestion with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter it” </span>(Exodus 21:37), indicates that in order to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that the thief slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">completely, and </span>after having slaughtered it just a bit <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>complete slaughter yet.
Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if you are correct, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult. </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava: When </span>does the mishna state that the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated</span> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? It is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered part </span>of the <span class="gemarra-italic">simanim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outside </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> finished </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">them inside </span>the Temple. Therefore, the animal became prohibited with regard to deriving benefit only at the final stage of slaughter, concomitant with the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, also <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of the same witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses, these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay everything, </span>i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment. This is in accordance with the Torah’s decree with regard to conspiring witnesses: “You shall do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). Since these witnesses attempted to obligate the alleged thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, they themselves must pay that full amount.
With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two other </span>witnesses, if both <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">and those</span> witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>set of witnesses, who testified about the theft of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the alleged thief the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is what they had conspired to cause him to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the last </span>set of witnesses, who attested to the slaughter or sale of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the alleged thief a twofold payment for a sheep or <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> threefold payment </span>for an ox, which they had conspired to cause him to pay over and above the double payment.
If only the witnesses in the <span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>witnesses, while the testimony about the theft remains intact, the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>to the animal’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the second set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the alleged thief the twofold or <span class="gemarra-regular">threefold payment, </span>the amount over and above the double payment, which is what they had conspired to cause him to pay.
If only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">from the last </span>set of witnesses was found to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspiring </span>witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second testimony </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it was not submitted by two valid witnesses, whereas the first testimony remains intact. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">from the first </span>set of witnesses is found to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspiring </span>witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire testimony </span>concerning the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if there is no theft</span> established by reliable testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is no</span> liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">selling </span>it. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> One who is rendered a conspiring witness is barred from providing testimony in the future. The Gemara cites a fundamental dispute with regard to this disqualification. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspiring witness: Abaye says: He is disqualified retroactively, </span>from when he provided his testimony. Any testimony he may have provided after that point in time is retroactively nullified. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: He is disqualified </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that point forward, </span>i.e., from when he was established to be a conspiring witness, but not retroactively from when he provided his testimony.
The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively </span>because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that time when he testified </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a wicked man, and the Torah said: “Do not put </span>your hand with <span class="gemarra-regular">the wicked </span>to be an unrighteous <span class="gemarra-regular">witness” </span>(Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: Do not allow a wicked man to serve as a witness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is disqualified </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that point forward </span>because the disqualification of <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspiring witness is a novelty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is not based on logic. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>is a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">against two </span>other witnesses, in which case neither testimony should be accepted. <span class="gemarra-regular">What did you see that </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">listen to </span>the second set of witnesses, who testify that the first set were not at the scene of the purported event? You could instead <span class="gemarra-regular">listen to </span>the first set of witnesses, who testify to the event, and disbelieve the second set. Yet the Torah teaches that the second set of witnesses is always deemed credible and the first set is subjected to punishment as conspiring witnesses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>as the disqualification of the conspiring witnesses is an anomaly, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have </span>the right to disqualify them <span class="gemarra-regular">only from the time of the novelty and onward, </span>i.e., this counterintuitive disqualification is not applied retroactively.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also holds like Abaye, who says </span>that by rights a conspiring witness <span class="gemarra-regular">should be disqualified retroactively </span>from when he provided his testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here this is Rava’s reason </span>for not disqualifying him retroactively: 

Daf 73a

It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the potential monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">loss for purchasers, </span>whose acquisitions had been validated by these witnesses between the time of the witnesses’ first testimony and when they were rendered conspiring witnesses. If the disqualification of the witnesses were applied retroactively, as by right it should, all these transactions would be nullified, which would cause a loss to these purchasers.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these two explanations of Rava’s opinion? After all, according to both explanations Rava did not apply the disqualification of conspiring witnesses retroactively. The Gemara explains that there is a difference in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testify</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about one </span>of the witnesses that he was not at the scene of the supposed crime, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>other witnesses testify <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> witness in a similar manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>there is a practical difference between the two explanations in a case where two witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>the first set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>testifying that they had once committed <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery </span>and are therefore unfit to give testimony. 
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to this version </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which you say </span>that Rava’s rejection of retroactive disqualification was <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a novelty, </span>in these two circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>novelty, and therefore he would agree that the disqualification should be retroactive. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to that version </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which you say </span>that Rava’s concern was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a potential <span class="gemarra-regular">loss for purchasers, </span>in these two circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a concern for a potential loss for purchasers. Consequently, in these circumstances as well Rava would reject retroactive disqualification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti related: Rav Pappa </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">took action, </span>i.e., ruled in a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, </span>and rejected retroactive disqualification of conspiring witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with regard to retroactive disqualification of conspiring witnesses. The Gemara provides a principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in disputes between Abaye and Rava the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rava, except for six cases in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abaye. </span>They are: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the cases represented by the mnemonic <span class="gemarra-italic">yod-ayin-lamed</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kuf-gimmel-mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>These <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are the following: Unknown despair [<span class="it-text">ye’ush</span>]; conspiring witness [<span class="it-text">eidim</span>] who are disqualified retroactively; a side post [<span class="it-text">leḥi</span>] standing alone; betrothal [<span class="it-text">kiddushin</span>] that is not given to consummation; revealing intent with a bill of divorce [<span class="it-text">get</span>]; and an apostate [<span class="it-text">mumar</span>] who sins rebelliously. 
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Abaye’s opinion from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, also <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of the same witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses, </span>these conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay everything, </span>including the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara explains the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the events occurred in the following sequence: The witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified concerning the theft </span>of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then testified concerning the </span>animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. And </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">they were rendered conspiring witnesses </span>for their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the theft, and then they were rendered conspiring witnesses </span>for their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the slaughter.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye, that a conspiring witness <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified retroactively </span>from the time he provided his testimony, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">once they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft, the matter becomes clarified retroactively that when they testified concerning the slaughter they were disqualified </span>to serve as witnesses. Consequently, that testimony should be rejected. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">must they pay </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment for their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the events did not happen in this sequence. Rather, the witnesses were <span class="gemarra-regular">first rendered conspiring witnesses </span>with regard to their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, </span>and only afterward were they rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>in rejection of this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, when </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses </span>with regard to their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the theft, the matter becomes clarified retroactively that when they testified concerning the slaughter they were disqualified </span>from providing testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">must they pay </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment for their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the </span>animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter?</span>
The Gemara gives its final answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye, since the mishna can be explained as discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testified </span>concerning the theft of the animal and its slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">at the same time, and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">they were rendered conspiring witnesses </span>with regard to testimony about both matters. Therefore, even if the disqualification of these witnesses is established retroactively, they were not disqualified when they provided their single testimony concerning the theft and the slaughter.
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute between Abaye and Rava is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testifying against </span>someone, claiming <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">testify against him that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they were rendered conspiring witnesses </span>only with regard to their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the theft, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated. </span>In other words, the testimony concerning the slaughter of the animal is null and void, as there is no longer any testimony that the animal was ever stolen. Therefore, the witnesses pay the double payment for having attempted to cause the alleged thief to pay that amount, while the accused is entirely exempt.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">if they were rendered conspiring witnesses </span>only with regard to their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the slaughter, </span>their testimony about the theft remains valid. Consequently, the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, and </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>a twofold or <span class="gemarra-regular">threefold payment </span>for having attempted to cause the thief to pay this amount, which is the fine for slaughter or sale beyond his double payment.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said when the theft and the slaughter were established <span class="gemarra-regular">by two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies. But </span>if these matters were established <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony, </span>then even if they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the testimony concerning the slaughter, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When the testimony concerning the slaughter is invalidated the testimony concerning the theft is likewise negated, and the alleged thief is not required to pay the double payment. This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yosei’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>did Rabbi Yosei mean when he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">By two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies, and what </span>did he mean when he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">By one </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony? If we say </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">By two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">testimonies, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">literally by two </span>separate testimonies, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">by two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">sets </span>of witnesses, one of which testifies concerning the theft while the other testifies concerning the slaughter, this would mean that the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">By one </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">by one set </span>of witnesses that testifies to both the theft and the slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">after the other.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if so, when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the facts are established <span class="gemarra-regular">by one testimony, </span>he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">one set </span>of witnesses testifying about both matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">after the other, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">that they testify concerning the theft and then testify concerning the slaughter. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they are rendered conspiring witnesses </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the slaughter, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is determined in accordance with the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that was partially invalidated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is entirely invalidated. And </span>consequently Rabbi Yosei would maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>considered to have been <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft </span>as well. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where would this be derived? </span>Why should the earlier testimony about the theft be negated by their status as conspiring witnesses from the later testimony concerning the slaughter?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case that when Rabbi Yosei said: <span class="gemarra-regular">By two testimonies, </span>he meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">By a single testimony </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to two testimonies. And what is that? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">one set</span> of witnesses who testify about both the theft and the slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">after the other, </span>at two separate times. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if these matters were established <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony, </span>when the witnesses testified about both matters <span class="gemarra-regular">at the same time, </span>Rabbi Yosei concedes that these are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered two separate testimonies, despite the fact that they refer to two different events.
The Gemara continues to analyze the dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis: The <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> discussing this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed that </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>i.e., both Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis, if a witness pauses briefly in his testimony and then continues to testify, it is considered one long testimony. This is in accordance with the principle that the legal status of a pause or retraction <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the two testimonies, the one concerning the theft and the one concerning the slaughter, are considered a single testimony.
The Gemara asks with regard to the above: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not with regard to this </span>that Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? As the Rabbis maintain, </span>like Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a conspiring witness <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from here on, </span>i.e., from when he is rendered a conspiring witness. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>it was only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that time, </span>when the other witnesses testify about them, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are rendered conspiring witnesses, </span>it is only with regard to their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that they are rendered conspiring witnesses, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the theft </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not rendered conspiring witnesses.</span>
And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei holds, </span>like Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a conspiring witness <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified retroactively, </span>from when he provided his testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are disqualified immediately when they testify, if they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the slaughter they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the legal status of a pause or retraction <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>i.e., the two testimonies are considered one unit.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>in rejection of this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it were accepted that the legal status of a pause or retraction <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking</span> a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, everyone </span>would agree that the witnesses are <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified retroactively, </span>and their testimony with regard to the theft would also be negated. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here they disagree </span>about that very issue, i.e., whether the legal status of a pause or retraction <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like</span> that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech. The Rabbis maintain that </span>if the pause is <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase, then the two aspects of the testimony provided by the witnesses

Daf 73b

<span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not like </span>one testimony of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>but are considered separate testimonies, and therefore the testimony concerning the theft remains valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei maintains that </span>the legal status of a pause <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>and therefore the testimony about the theft is disqualified together with the testimony concerning the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does Rabbi Yosei </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">maintain </span>that the legal status of a statement interrupted or retracted <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">required for speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech? But didn’t we learn </span>otherwise in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Temura</span> 25b): If one designates an animal by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is hereby a substitut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a burnt-offering, a substitute for a peace-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has issued two contradictory statements and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a substitute for a burnt-offering, </span>i.e., only the first part of his statement is accepted. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If he intended this </span>outcome <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset, </span>that the animal should serve both as the substitute of a burnt-offering and as the substitute of a peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is impossible </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">to call it </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">two names at once, </span>i.e., the only way he can make his intent known is by issuing these two apparently contradictory declarations consecutively, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the animal has the status of both a substitute for a burnt-offering and a substitute for a peace-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said: </span>This animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">a substitute for a burnt</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">changed his mind and said: A substitute for a peace-offering, it is a substitute for a burnt-offering.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed </span>this ruling: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">changed his mind </span>before saying: A substitute for a peace-offering, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he cannot remove the status he already applied to the animal, and the animal certainly remains a substitute for a burnt-offering. Rabbi Yosei would not have issued such an obvious ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said </span>in response to this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are speaking </span>of a case where the individual <span class="gemarra-regular">changed his mind within the time required for speakin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a short phrase. Rabbi Yosei holds that when one adds to a statement after a pause, even if the addition was made within a short time, it is considered a separate statement, which does not reverse the initial declaration. This contradicts the explanation given for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above, according to which Rabbi Yosei maintains that when one adds to an existing statement within the time required for speaking a short phrase it is considered continuous speech.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are two </span>time frames that are referred to as being <span class="gemarra-regular">within the time required for speakin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a short phrase. <span class="gemarra-regular">One is the time required for a student to greet a rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one is the time required for the rabbi to greet a student. When does Rabbi Yosei hold </span>that a statement added within the time required for speaking a short phrase is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered continuous speech? When the words are added <span class="gemarra-regular">within the time required for a student to greet his rabbi </span>using the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Peace be upon you, my rabbi and teacher, as </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is a long </span>pause. By contrast, if the statement is added <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span>shorter <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>frame <span class="gemarra-regular">required for the rabbi to greet his student: Peace be upon you, </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the added words constitute speech that is continuous with the original statement.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Witnesses </span>to a capital crime <span class="gemarra-regular">who were </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted </span>by two other witnesses, and <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately they, </span>the first set of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">were rendered conspiring witnesses, are killed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>in accordance with the punishment for conspiring witnesses involved in a capital case, despite the fact that their testimony was already disqualified prior to the discovery of their conspiracy. The reason is that the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction</span> of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>the process <span class="gemarra-regular">has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">been completed </span>at the time of the contradiction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From where do I say </span>that this is so? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 1:3) that if witnesses say: <span class="gemarra-regular">We testify with regard to so-and-so that he blinded his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave’s eye and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked out his tooth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the master is obligated to pay him compensation for the value of his tooth, <span class="gemarra-regular">as that is what the master says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">they were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses, they pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of an eye to the slave.</span>
Rava explains that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as written is problematic: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>it is exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no other set </span>of witnesses other than those whose statement is quoted in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and the opposing set of witnesses who establish them as conspiring witnesses, several problems arise: First, why should they <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of an eye to the slave? After emancipating him </span>by testifying that his master has blinded him, should <span class="gemarra-regular">they be required to pay </span>him the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his eye?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, they should be required to pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the entire slave to the master, </span>as they intended to cause him to lose ownership of his slave through their false testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say: <span class="gemarra-regular">As that is what the master says, </span>i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">satisfactory to the master </span>that his slave be emancipated as a result of this testimony?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that this case involves another, competing, testimony that is not mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not </span>correct to say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>prior to the testimonies mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>other witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said: </span>The master first <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked out </span>the slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">tooth </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his eye, in </span>which case <span class="gemarra-regular">the master is required </span>to emancipate the slave and also <span class="gemarra-regular">to give him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his eye; and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">an intermediate </span>set of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said </span>the testimony quoted in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that first the master blinded the slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">eye and then </span>knocked out <span class="gemarra-regular">his tooth? </span>According to this account the master would still be required to emancipate the slave, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he would be required to give him only </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his tooth, </span>which is much less than the value of an eye. <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>this case the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicts </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">the intermediate ones.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>the meaning of the clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">As that is what the master says, </span>i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master. It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that what </span>the intermediate witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>i.e., that he owes the value of a tooth, <span class="gemarra-regular">is satisfactory to him, </span>as according to the claim of the first set, he owes the value of an eye. Since there are now contradictory testimonies, the testimony stating the claim of a loss of lesser value is accepted, and in that case the master would have to pay the slave only for the value of his tooth, in addition to emancipating him. This judgment corresponds exactly to the testimony of the intermediate set of witnesses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the intermediate </span>set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found to be conspiring witnesses, </span>as a third set of witnesses testified that the intermediate set was not at the scene of the incident at all. Therefore, the intermediate set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of an eye to the slave </span>less the value of a tooth, as this is the amount of monetary damage the slave stood to incur as a result of their testimony.
Rava concludes his proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction</span> of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony. Although the testimony of the intermediate set of witnesses had already been contradicted before it was shown to be conspiring testimony, nevertheless, they can still be established as conspiring witness at that later stage, which means that they must pay an amount equivalent to the loss they were attempting to cause through their testimony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: No. </span>There is another possible interpretation for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which answers the questions raised above and yet does not serve as proof for Rava’s opinion. According to this interpretation, the contradictory testimony was given after, not before, the testimony mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
It is possible that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a second set of witnesses both <span class="gemarra-regular">reversed </span>the order of events, by testifying that the tooth was knocked out before the blinding of the eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at the same time <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered </span>the first set witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">as conspiring witnesses, </span>by testifying that those original witnesses were not at the scene of the supposed events they claimed to have witnessed. It can be argued, albeit in a far-fetched manner, that the testimony of the first set of witnesses is considered to be to the master’s advantage even at this stage, because he knows what really happened, as reflected in the testimony of the later witnesses. Accordingly, Rava maintains that there are a total of three sets of witnesses in the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, while Abaye says that there are only two sets.
Abaye elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do I say that my interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is correct? 

Daf 74a

<span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case in which the second set witnesses both <span class="gemarra-regular">reverses </span>the order of events <span class="gemarra-regular">and renders </span>the first pair <span class="gemarra-regular">as conspiring witnesses, </span>it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first case as well, </span>in parallel fashion, states a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case in which the second set of witnesses both <span class="gemarra-regular">reverses </span>the order of events <span class="gemarra-regular">and renders </span>the first pair <span class="gemarra-regular">as conspiring witnesses.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that if witnesses say: <span class="gemarra-regular">We testify </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so that he knocked out his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave’s tooth and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his eye, </span>which requires the master to emancipate him and compensate him for the value of his eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">as that is what the slave says, </span>i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">they were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses, they pay the value of an eye to the master.</span>
Abaye analyzes this clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is speaking of a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the latter </span>set of witnesses, who attested that the first set of witnesses were conspiring witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not concede that </span>there was any <span class="gemarra-regular">injury at all </span>inflicted on the slave by his master, then there is no testimony to confirm that those injuries were inflicted other than that given by the witnesses who were shown to be conspiring witnesses. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should be required to pay the entire value of the slave to the master, </span>as this is the amount of monetary damage the master stood to incur as a result of their false testimony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is obvious that all of them, </span>i.e., both the first set of witnesses and the latter set, <span class="gemarra-regular">concede with regard to the injury </span>inflicted on the slave by the master. They both agree that the master both blinded the slave’s eye and knocked out his tooth and therefore is obligated to emancipate him. They disagree concerning only the order of events. The first set of witnesses said that the tooth injury occurred first and the eye injury occurred afterward. Consequently, they sought to require the master to emancipate the slave and compensate him for the eye injury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the second set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">reversed </span>the order of events in their testimony, saying that the eye injury took place first, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the same testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">they rendered </span>the first pair <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> by testifying that they were not present when the events occurred. Since the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be interpreted in this manner, it stands to reason that the first case should be explained similarly.
The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what are the circumstances</span> of the case? The second set of witnesses, who are deemed credible, have established that the injuries did not take place on the date reported by the first set of witnesses. According to their testimony, when did the injuries take place? <span class="gemarra-regular">If the latter </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">postdated </span>the events, by testifying that the injuries were actually inflicted at a later stage than that mentioned by the first set of witnesses, the first set of witnesses should <span class="gemarra-regular">still be required to pay the </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">value of a slave to the master.</span>
The reason the first set of witnesses should be liable is <span class="gemarra-regular">that when they</span> sought to <span class="gemarra-regular">impose liability upon the man, </span>i.e., the master, this <span class="gemarra-regular">man was not yet </span>burdened with any <span class="gemarra-regular">liability. </span>When the first set of witnesses testified about the injuries, the master was not yet obligated to emancipate his slave or pay damages. Therefore, these conspiring witnesses should be required to pay these sums, which they had sought to impose on the master. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span>set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">predated </span>the time of the injuries, by testifying that they were inflicted at an earlier date than that attested to by the first set of witnesses.
The Gemara continues to analyze the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>for having injured his slave when the first set of witnesses submitted their testimony, those witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">should still be required to pay the entire value of the slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the master, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>at the time of their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">the man, </span>i.e., the master, was <span class="gemarra-regular">not yet liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The first set of witnesses sought to render the master liable at a time when he was exempt from liability, and therefore they should be obligated to pay him the full value of the slave.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">stood tria</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> for having inflicted these injuries, and had been sentenced by the court to emancipate the slave for the first injury and pay him for the second injury. Then, the master evaded payment, and was subsequently brought before another court, where witnesses testified that the first court had established liability for knocking out the tooth first and then blinding the slave’s eye. This testimony was subsequently rendered conspiring testimony by a second set of witnesses, who testified both that the first set of witnesses was not at the scene of the first trial and that the results of the trial were actually reversed, i.e., the master’s liability was for blinding the eye first and then for knocking out the tooth. Since the first set of witnesses, who were rendered conspiring witnesses, sought to increase the master’s liability payment from that of the value of a tooth to that of an eye, they must pay the value of an eye to the master.
Rava sought to infer from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to his opinion that contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said to Rav Ashi: From which </span>case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is the inference of Rava? If we say </span>that his inference is <span class="gemarra-regular">from the first clause, </span>this is difficult. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>if it involves three sets of witnesses, as claimed by Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">is the intermediate </span>set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted </span>and rejected before they are established as conspiring witnesses? The first set of witnesses testified that the eye injury took place after the tooth injury, whereas the intermediate set of witnesses reversed the order. If so, the intermediate set of witnesses sought to lower the master’s payment from the value of an eye to that of a tooth.
Rav Aḥa continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since if </span>the second set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">would not have been rendered conspiring witnesses, the testimony would </span>have been <span class="gemarra-regular">established in accordance with </span>their statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the judgment would have been decided in accordance with </span>their testimony. The reason their testimony would have determined the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">that one hundred dinars </span>is subsumed <span class="gemarra-regular">within two hundred, </span>i.e., testimony concerning a large sum includes testimony concerning a smaller sum.
Rav Aḥa continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, it is the first </span>set of witnesses, who testified that the eye injury occurred last, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>testimony would be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted </span>and rejected, whereas the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">the intermediate </span>set of witnesses would <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted at all, </span>as it is accepted in full. If so, this is not a case of witnesses who were rejected due to contradiction and then subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses.
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Aḥa in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">three sets </span>of witnesses, it is logical to assume that the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause is also </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>sets of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">infers </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause.</span>
Rava explains that the latter clause is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where two </span>witnesses, i.e., the ones mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and say: </span>The master <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked out </span>the slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">tooth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his eye, and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment in accordance with their statement, </span>obligating the master to emancipate his slave and compensate him for the value of his eye.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">two other </span>witnesses, who were not mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and say </span>that the events were reversed: First the master <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his </span>slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">eye and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he knocked out his tooth, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they contradict </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">those first </span>witnesses. At this point the master is obligated to emancipate his slave and pay him only the value of his tooth, as this much was required of him according to both sets of witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then the first pair <span class="gemarra-regular">were found to be conspiring witnesses. </span>Therefore, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of an eye to the master, </span>less the value of a tooth.
Rava reaches his conclusion based on the following reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it enters your mind that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony, and witnesses who were first contradicted and then rendered conspiring witnesses are not punished as conspiring witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">why must </span>these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay? They were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted from the outset, </span>before they were shown to be conspiring witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from </span>the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how could <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye,</span> who disagrees with Rava, refute this proof? He could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: Granted, it is impossible </span>to interpret <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause without </span>the supposition <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">three sets </span>of witnesses involved. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>with regard to that first clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">As that is what the master says, </span>i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the master. The only testimony recorded in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the master blinded the slave’s eye and then knocked out his tooth. Why would this be considered satisfactory to the master? It must therefore be assumed that this testimony was preceded by another one that was even less advantageous to the master. That testimony confirmed the injuries but placed the eye injury after the tooth injury, which involves greater liability for the master. Finally, a third set of witnesses must have arrived and rendered the intermediate set as conspiring witnesses, so that there are a total of three sets of witnesses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, why do I </span>need to explain it as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">three sets </span>of witnesses? If you say that it is because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states concerning this case: <span class="gemarra-regular">As that is what the slave says, </span>i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the slave, this does not prove that there is another testimony, not mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that is less favorable to the slave than this one.
The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a slave would say anything, </span>i.e., any form of testimony would be favorable to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is satisfactory for him that he should be emancipated. </span>The court’s acceptance of testimony confirming either order of events would result in his emancipation from slavery, and therefore both testimonies are satisfactory to him. Although there is a compelling reason to posit the existence of three sets of witnesses in the first clause, there is no justification to do so in the second clause, and therefore it should be explained as did Abaye, as discussing only two sets of witnesses.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira objects to </span>the basic assumption of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that when a master inflicts two injuries upon his Canaanite slave he must indemnify the slave for the second injury. One can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that if the master <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his </span>slave’s <span class="gemarra-regular">eye, </span>

Daf 74b

the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">should go </span>free <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of his eye, </span>and if he <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked out his tooth </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">should go </span>free <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of his tooth, </span>and if the master both <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his eye and knocked out his tooth, </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">should go </span>free <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">his eye and his tooth, </span>without the master having to pay damages for the loss of his tooth.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>to him in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to your </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> “And if a man smites the eye of his slave or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26). The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“for his eye’s sake” </span>indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not for the sake of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">his eye and his tooth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The same can be inferred from the subsequent verse: “And if he smites out his bondman’s tooth or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“for his tooth’s sake” </span>indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not for the sake of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">his eye and his tooth.</span>
The Gemara returns to Rava’s opinion that the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: We too </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>from the mishna that Rava’s claim is correct, as it teaches (72b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, also <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of the same witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses, </span>these conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay everything, </span>i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they testified concerning the theft and then testified concerning the slaughter, and they were </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft and then were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter?</span>
Rav Idi bar Avin states his inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">But once they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft, </span>their testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the slaughter </span>is in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted, </span>i.e., nullified, as testimony concerning the slaughter of an animal without prior testimony establishing that the animal was stolen is meaningless. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay everything. And if it enters your mind </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">why should they pay </span>a fine <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>lying about the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter? </span>Their testimony concerning the slaughter was rendered irrelevant before it was established as conspiring testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>this mishna that the <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is the start of determining that </span>testimony is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring </span>testimony?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in refutation of this inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the witnesses were <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter first, </span>before they were rendered conspiring witnesses in their testimony concerning the theft itself. In this case, the testimony concerning the slaughter was not rendered irrelevant before it was rendered conspiring testimony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">in the dispute </span>between other <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, before Rava and Abaye discussed it. As it was stated: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>to a capital crime <span class="gemarra-regular">who were </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">contradicted </span>by two other witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately were rendered conspiring witnesses, </span>this is a matter of dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar. One said: </span>These witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are killed, </span>like all conspiring witnesses in a capital case, as the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one said: They are not killed.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">It may be concluded </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says they are not killed. As Rabbi Elazar says: Witnesses who were contradicted in </span>a case involving the taking of <span class="gemarra-regular">a life, </span>i.e., a capital case, <span class="gemarra-regular">are flogge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for violating the prohibition: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rabbi Elazar who says </span>that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately found to be conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are killed, why are they flogged </span>in this case? There is always the possibility that they might be rendered conspiring witnesses, which would render them liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. Consequently, this is a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition given as warning </span>of liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for court</span>-imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">capital punishment, and </span>there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is not flogged for </span>violating <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition given as warning </span>of liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for court</span>-imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">capital </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punishment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rabbi Elazar who says </span>that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately were found to be conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are not killed? </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">It may be concluded </span>that this is so.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that witnesses who were contradicted in a capital case are flogged. Why <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">flogged </span>simply because their testimony was contradicted? <span class="gemarra-regular">They are two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are contradicted by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>other witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">What did you see </span>in the testimony of the second set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>leads <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on those </span>witnesses to the extent that the first set of witnesses is flogged? You could just as well <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on these </span>witnesses, i.e., the first witnesses. How can the court ever determine with certainty that a given testimony is false based merely on contradictory testimony?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The contradiction to which Rabbi Elazar is referring involves a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the witnesses testified that they saw a certain person murdered, and subsequently the individual who was allegedly <span class="gemarra-regular">killed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came </span>to the court <span class="gemarra-regular">on his feet, </span>conclusively disproving their testimony.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>the stolen animal, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness or based on his own </span>admission, i.e., he himself admitted that he performed these acts, without there being any witness testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, but he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a capital offense, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole his father’s </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">his father died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and afterward he slaughtered or sold </span>it, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated </span>it as an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he slaughtered or sold </span>it, in all these cases the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, but he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">bears no </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility, </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the fact that the thief slaughtered or sold the animal was established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness, </span>he is exempt from the fourfold of fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: By stating this case, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: The case of the thief slaughtering the animal established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness is similar to </span>a case where it is established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case where the slaughter is established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness, if one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">witness comes </span>and corroborates the testimony of the first, he <span class="gemarra-regular">joins together with</span> the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two, and the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>where the slaughter is established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">if witnesses come </span>after his admission he <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara comments: This interpretation of the mishna serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Huna </span>says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says. As Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt </span>from payment, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses com</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and testify to his liability.
Since Rav Huna’s <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was mentioned, the Gemara discusses in detail <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt </span>from payment, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised an objection to Rav Huna </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who blinded the eye of his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he experienced great jo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> as a result. Rabban Gamliel had long wanted to emancipate Tavi, but it is generally prohibited to emancipate a Canaanite slave. The injury provided a fortuitous opportunity for Rabban Gamliel to emancipate his slave, as blinding the eye of one’s slave results in his emancipation (see Exodus 21:27).
Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">encountered Rabbi Yehoshu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you know that my slave Tavi was emancipated? </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why? </span>What circumstances enabled you to emancipate him? Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span> I was able to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I blinded his eye. </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabban Gamliel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your statement is nothing, </span>and is not grounds for his emancipation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he has no witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who can testify that you did this to him. The principle is that one does not pay a fine based on his own admission. One pays a fine only based on the testimony of witnesses. The requirement to emancipate one’s slave after injuring his eye is a type of fine.
The Gemara infers from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if Tavi <span class="gemarra-regular">had witnesses </span>who could testify with regard to the injury, Rabban Gamliel would be <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to emancipate him, even if they testify after Rabban Gamliel’s admission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>this that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify with regard to his liability.
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: This case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel is different, as he admitted </span>to his actions when he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not in the presence of a court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> An admission not in the presence of a court does not exempt the perpetrator from paying the relevant fine. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yehoshua was the president of the court, </span>so it is likely that the encounter took place in court. 

Daf 75a

The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">in court </span>when Rabban Gamliel encountered him.
The Gemara asks a question from a different source: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabban Gamliel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your statement is nothing, as you have already admitted </span>to inflicting the injury yourself? This indicates that even if witnesses would subsequently testify about the injury, Rabban Gamliel would not emancipate Tavi. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>the case that the difference between these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <span class="gemarra-regular">As you have no witnesses, holds </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is liable </span>to pay the fine if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <span class="gemarra-regular">As you have already admitted, holds </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt </span>from payment, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>it is possible to understand the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> differently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone agrees </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt, </span>even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree with regard to </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <span class="gemarra-regular">As you have no witnesses, holds that </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">was outside the court </span>when Rabban Gamliel encountered him, and therefore his admission is disregarded. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who says </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <span class="gemarra-regular">As you have already admitted, holds </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">was in the court </span>when Rabban Gamliel met him, so Rabban Gamliel’s admission is a valid admission.
The Gemara analyzes in detail the dispute alluded to above: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, and afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and Shmuel says </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ahilai said: What is the reason for </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>With regard to theft, which is subject to a fine of double payment, the Torah states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The verb for “shall be found” is doubled, as the verse states “<span class="it-text">himmatze</span> <span class="it-text">timmatze</span>.” Rav derives from the repetition that there are two matters that are found: The double payment is imposed only <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is found </span>[<span class="it-text">himmatze</span>], i.e., it is revealed that he stole the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>and the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>[<span class="it-text">timmatze</span>], as determined <span class="gemarra-regular">through judges. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes one who incriminates himself </span>through his own admission.
Rav asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the Torah to teach this here? This principle is already <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>a different source: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The one whom the judges convict </span>shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that self-incrimination is insufficient to render one liable for double payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the fact that there are two verses to serve as the source for this principle that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>he is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine is exempt </span>from paying even if <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward witnesses come </span>and testify to his liability. The second verse teaches this additional novelty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>would explain the double expression differently. He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: That</span> verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary to </span>teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief himself </span>must pay double payment, i.e., the double payment is imposed not only upon a bailee who takes a false oath that the article entrusted to him was stolen, but it is also imposed upon a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught </span>earlier in this chapter (63b).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav raised an objection to Shmuel </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">saw witnesses who were approaching </span>with the intent to testify against him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at that point <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>I admit that <span class="gemarra-regular">I stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I did not slaughter or sell </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays only the principal. </span>This indicates that even if those witnesses subsequently testify, the thief remains exempt from the double payment as well as the fourfold or fivefold payment. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the witnesses returned back</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., ultimately they did not testify.
Rav raised an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this interpretation is impossible, as can be seen <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Let the witnesses come and testify. </span>This means that their testimony will be accepted and the thief will be required to pay the relevant fines. <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>it may be deduced <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>there is no point in the witnesses testifying, as the thief will be exempt in any case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to </span>Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t there </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, which stands in accordance with my </span>opinion? When I said that one who admits that he is liable to pay a fine and afterward witnesses testified that he committed that act is deemed liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel, </span>his opinion on this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as he himself was forced to admit that his opinion is in accordance only with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, not that of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. But <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rav, shall we say </span>that his opinion too <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>necessarily subject to this dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I say </span>my opinion in accordance with the rulings of both <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says </span>that the testimony of the witnesses obligates the thief to pay a fine even after his admission <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in that specific case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>his guilt solely <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">fear </span>of the impending testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of the witnesses. But here, </span>in an ordinary case of admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> there is no impending testimony to incriminate him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he admits </span>his guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">of his own </span>volition, <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">concede </span>that the thief is exempt from payment even if witnesses subsequently testify that he is liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: Rav’s statement is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I stole </span>an item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole </span>that item. In that case it is logical that the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated himself to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal </span>amount via his admission.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: I did not steal </span>anything, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did steal </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and subsequently </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Yes, I did steal the animal, and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>I also <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he slaughtered or sold </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The reason he is liable is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> through his admission he sought to <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt himself from any </span>payment whatsoever. In order for an admission to exempt the perpetrator from a fine, it must include an admission that he is liable to pay some payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>In this case <span class="gemarra-regular">I have gotten the better [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kipaḥti</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the elders of the school of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a reference to Rav Hamnuna. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel </span>injuring his slave, he <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>seeking to <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt himself from any payment </span>whatsoever through his admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet earlier in the Gemara it was said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda stated </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Huna </span>to challenge Rav Huna’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not answer him </span>that Rabban Gamliel’s case was different because his admission served to exempt him entirely.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was also stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>the same opinion as Rav Hamnuna. If a thief says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I stole </span>an item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole </span>that item, the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates himself, </span>through his admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: I did not steal </span>anything, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did steal </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and subsequently </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Yes, I did steal the animal, and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>I also <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>it, and then <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he slaughtered or sold </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>through his admission <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span>seeking to <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt himself from any </span>payment whatsoever.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishna and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that are <span class="gemarra-regular">also precisely </span>formulated in accordance with this opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>(74b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the stolen animal, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness or based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, but he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the mishna to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>in the beginning of this case: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an ox or a sheep, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the case more simply: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it, as established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness or based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays only the principal. </span>This would serve to teach the same principle in a less complicated manner, without the need for two additional witnesses. 

Daf 75b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>correct to say that by citing the more complicated case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: It is </span>only in this case, where it is established that the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is established that <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span>or sold it <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness or based on his own </span>admission, and <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not obligate himself </span>through his admission <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal, </span>that he is obligated to pay the fine.
The Gemara elaborates: In other words, it is only in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where the theft is established based on the testimony of two witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say </span>that liability <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to the </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of one witness, </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as when </span>the slaughter is established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">witness </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">comes he joins together with </span>the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two witnesses and the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes liable </span>to pay, so <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>in a case when the slaughter is established <span class="gemarra-regular">based on his own </span>admission, <span class="gemarra-regular">if witnesses </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and testify, he <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes liable </span>to pay the fine, as his admission would not have rendered him liable to pay any payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it is established that the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered or sold </span>it, all <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">one witness or based on his own </span>admission, in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case through his admission <span class="gemarra-regular">he obligates himself to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal</span> amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that when witnesses testify subsequent <span class="gemarra-regular">to his own </span>admission it is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to when they arrive subsequent <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">of one witness, </span>and he is liable to pay the fine in both cases. Rather, since in this case his admission would have rendered him liable to pay the principal due to the fact that the theft was not established based on the testimony of two witnesses, it is considered a proper admission, which exempts him from paying the fine.
The <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that supports Rav Hamnuna’s opinion is the one cited earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: </span>If a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">saw witnesses who were approaching </span>with the intent to testify against him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>at that point he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I admit that <span class="gemarra-regular">I stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I did not slaughter or sell </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays only the principal. Why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do I </span>need the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach: And </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I admit that <span class="gemarra-regular">I stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">but I did not slaughter or sell </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it teach </span>a simpler case, in which the thief said <span class="gemarra-regular">either: I stole </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I sold </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>by choosing the more complicated case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: The </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason that </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>from payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is that he says: I stole </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">he obligated himself to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: I did not steal, and witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did steal </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and subsequently</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>changed his claim and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and confirmed <span class="gemarra-regular">that he slaughtered or sold </span>it, in which case the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">did not obligate himself to pay the principal </span>or any other payment, he would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, an admission to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">admission, </span>as such an admission does not obligate the perpetrator to pay a fine.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says, </span>in rejection of this second proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible to explain the reason the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> chose to present this case in a different manner, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: That once </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I stole </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I did not slaughter or sell </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified <span class="gemarra-regular">that he slaughtered or sold it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this exemption? 
The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a payment of four </span>sheep for a sheep and <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>oxen for an ox (see Exodus 21:37). This indicates that a thief can be rendered liable to pay, respectively, a fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not a fourfold payment </span>for an ox, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor a threefold payment </span>for a sheep. In other words, one should not view the fines as independent of each other, that if the thief is found with the animal he pays as a fine the double payment, and if he slaughtered or sold it he pays a different fine, i.e., the fourfold or fivefold payment. Rather, the fourfold or fivefold payment comprises the principle, the double payment, and an additional two or three times the principle. By admitting to his act of theft, the thief exempts himself from the double payment, and the remaining fine for slaughtering a sheep would be a threefold payment, or a fourfold payment for an ox, which are not mandated by the Torah.
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan is the <span class="gemarra-regular">subject of </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">testify that </span>some-one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">testify </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">him that he slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>who had testified concerning the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft were rendered conspiring witnesses, </span>the thief is exempt from all payment, as <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated. </span>If the testimony concerning the theft was undermined, the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is thereby rendered irrelevant. Consequently, the alleged thief is exempt from any payment.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the witnesses </span>who testified concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaughter </span>or sale <span class="gemarra-regular">were rendered conspiring witnesses, </span>but the testimony concerning the theft remains credible, the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, and </span>the conspiring witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a threefold payment, </span>as that is the loss they sought to impose on the thief. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of Sumakhos: </span>The witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, and </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for a ram. </span>This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Sumakhos: <span class="gemarra-regular">To which </span>clause in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is Sumakhos referring? If we say </span>that he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first clause, </span>in which the testimony concerning the theft is invalidated, this is impossible. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Sumakhos </span>accept the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated, </span>in this case rendering the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale irrelevant if there is no testimony concerning the theft?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>he must be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is invalidated. This, too, is impossible, as in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">say well, </span>i.e., what they state is reasonable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay a threefold payment. </span>On what basis would Sumakhos dispute this ruling?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that Sumakhos is referring to a different case entirely, one that is not mentioned explicitly in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a different matter is </span>at the core of the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">between them. </span>Sumakhos is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">You stole </span>an animal. The thief <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, I did steal </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">I slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I sold </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But I did not steal </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in your presence, </span>and your testimony that you saw me steal it is false. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> subsequently the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses who rendered </span>the original witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses, </span>by testifying that they were in a different place at the time they claimed that the theft occurred, thereby proving <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">did not steal in their presence. And </span>finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses who testified that </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered or sold </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Sumakhos and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree over </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">an admission to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of a stolen animal is a valid admission, even though it does not lead to liability to pay any payment. Both parties to the dispute agree that the admission of a perpetrator only in response to the testimony of witnesses is not a valid admission.
The dispute between them is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Rabbis maintain that even though </span>the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">admission concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>itself is not a valid admission because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the witnesses </span>who have testified against him that <span class="gemarra-regular">he admits </span>his guilt, nevertheless, his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">admission, </span>despite the fact it does not render the thief liable to pay a fine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment. The conspiring witnesses must pay the double payment to the thief, since this is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, while the thief pays the double payment to the owner, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole the animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Sumakhos maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">admission concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>itself is not a valid admission because it was <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses that he admits </span>his guilt, so too, the admission <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">admission, </span>because it does not obligate him to pay a fine, as stated by Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">those first witnesses </span>to the theft, <span class="gemarra-regular">who were rendered conspiring witnesses, pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, </span>as that is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the double payment to the owner of the animal, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole it, and since his admission is invalid he must pay an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">threefold </span>payment, for a total of a fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ox, or a twofold </span>payment, for a total of a fourfold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">for a ram. </span>If this is their dispute, Sumakhos is in agreement with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan, while the Rabbis disagree with this opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: No; </span>it is possible to explain the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> differently, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone, </span>i.e., both Sumakhos and the Rabbis, maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">an admission concerning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of a stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">admission, </span>as it does not render the perpetrator liable to pay any payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, they disagree over </span>the concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that you cannot render conspiratory </span>testimony. Sumakhos and the Rabbis disagree with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where witnesses come and say to </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">You stole </span>an animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did steal </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">I slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I sold </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>you are false witnesses, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was not in your presence that I stole </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so. And </span>the thief subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">brought witnesses who established </span>the first set of witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">as conspiring witnesses </span>by testifying that the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">did not steal </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in their presence. And </span>finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so and so-and-so, </span>the two people mentioned by the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">came and testified against </span>the thief, saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>point that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, that the Rabbis maintain </span>that the testimony of so-and-so and so-and-so is <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that you cannot render conspiratory </span>testimony, as the thief himself admits that their testimony is true. <span class="gemarra-regular">And any testimony that you cannot render conspiratory </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered valid <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony. </span>Their testimony is therefore discounted, which leaves only the thief’s statement. The thief pays the money he admitted he owes, i.e., the principal of the theft, but he is exempt from paying a fine. Meanwhile, the first witnesses, who had been rendered conspiring witnesses, pay the thief the double payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Sumakhos maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony that you cannot render conspiratory </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless considered valid <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony. </span>Therefore, the testimony of so-and-so and so-and-so is valid, and the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Sumakhos states that the thief pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold payment for a ram. The reason is that the thief receives a double payment from the first, conspiring witnesses, which he gives to the owner of the animal, along with the remainder of the payment. This amounts to a threefold payment for an ox and twofold payment for a ram that he is required to pay from his own funds.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But do we not maintain </span>as an accepted principle <span class="gemarra-regular">that testimony that you cannot render conspiratory </span>testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony? </span>It is not reasonable to suggest that Sumakhos would disagree with that principle. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>witnesses say <span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not know on which day </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">at which time </span>of day the events in question occurred, in which case no one could ever say to them: You were in a different place at that time, thereby rendering them conspiring witnesses. With regard to such a case one can say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no testimony at all, </span>as the vague statement of the witnesses does not allow them to be prosecuted as conspiring witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">supporting</span> their testimony, which renders it more credible.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the Sages stated in the name of Sumakhos: The witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the thief admits that he stole </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to pay the principal </span>amount regardless of any subsequent testimony provided by witnesses. Why, then, should the conspiring witnesses be required to pay a double payment, which includes the principal amount? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says in the name of Rav: Teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> differently, and instead say that Sumakhos said that the witnesses are liable for 

Daf 76a

the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment of </span>the extra part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, </span>i.e., the amount that exceeds the principal.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it </span>as an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he slaughtered or sold </span>it, the thief pays the double payment but he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Granted, he is not liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for the slaughter </span>of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when he slaughtered </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to the Temple </span>treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not slaughter </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to its owner.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But let him be liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>having <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>the animal in the first place, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary </span>person, and <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it to Heaven </span>by consecrating it? Consecration should be considered tantamount to a sale, as in either case ownership of the animal is transferred to another party.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to replace with another animal if one of the original animals is lost or dies <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">to be in the possession of their owne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> (see 74b). The mishna is referring a case where the thief consecrated the animal in such a manner that he is obligated to replace it if it is lost or damaged before being sacrificed. One consequence of this potential financial loss is that the animal is considered to be in the thief’s possession even after he consecrated it. Therefore, the animal’s consecration is not tantamount to a sale to another party.
The Gemara rejects this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>it follows that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, which is stated before his opinion is introduced, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with what are we dealing here </span>in the mishna? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where the thief consecrated the animal as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of lesser sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of lesser sanctity is the property of </span>its putative <span class="gemarra-regular">owner, and is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession. </span>Therefore, its consecration is not tantamount to a sale to another party.
The Gemara rejects this answer as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">But what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> had the thief consecrated the animal as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of the most sacred order? </span>Would he have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than teaching </span>the following in <span class="gemarra-regular">the earlier clause </span>of the mishna (70a), in the case that stands in opposition to this one: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he consecrated </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish and teach</span> the opposing <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the same category <span class="gemarra-regular">itself.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> could have taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that the thief is exempt if he consecrated the stolen animal and then slaughtered or sold it, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said only if he consecrated the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of lesser sanctity; but </span>if he consecrated it <span class="gemarra-regular">as an offering of the most sacred order he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment, </span>as the consecration itself would be tantamount to a sale to another party.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually there is no difference </span>whether the thief consecrates the animal as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of the most sacred order </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>whether he consecrates it as <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering of lesser sanctity. And as</span> for the matter that presented <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for you, </span>namely: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary </span>person and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it to Heaven </span>by consecration, one can answer as follows: If someone, e.g., Reuven, <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary </span>person, e.g., Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven’s ox and now,</span> after the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Shimon’s ox. </span>By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it to Heaven, </span>i.e., he consecrated it as an offering, it is not considered to have been transferred into the possession of another party, as <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven’s ox and now, </span>after consecration, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuven’s ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>In the case of sacrificial animals for which the owner bears financial responsibility to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal for which the owner bears no financial responsibility, the thief is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment. At this stage the Gemara assumes that Rabbi Shimon requires the fourfold or fivefold payment as a fine for the act of consecration itself rather than for the act of slaughtering the animal. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Although Rabbi Shimon holds </span>that there is a logic of: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary </span>person and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it to Heaven </span>via consecration, nevertheless, he <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: He should have said that if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which one bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. In other words, if the thief stole a non-sacred animal and subsequently consecrated it as an offering in such a manner that he bears responsibility to replace it, he should be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment for the act of consecration. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">has not yet left his possession, </span>and therefore this act of consecration should not be considered a sale.
By contrast, if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which one does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility, </span>the thief should be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. If the thief stole a non-sacred animal and then consecrated it as an offering in such a way that he does not bear responsibility to replace it, he should be liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment for the act of consecration, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he has </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from his possession.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>is not discussing the issue of whether the consecration of an animal is tantamount to its sale. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is referring to a different matter, </span>one that is not explicitly mentioned in the mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: One who steals </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after a thief </span>has already stolen it, i.e., he steals it from the thief, does not pay the double payment, and if he slaughtered or sold the animal he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. And similarly, one who steals consecrated </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the house of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is exempt from the double payment, and if it was a sacrificial animal and the thief slaughtered or sold it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this last ruling? The reason is as it is written: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was stolen from the house of the man, </span>if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The phrase “from the house of the man” indicates that a thief is obligated to pay the double payment only when they are stolen from a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>if the item in question was stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">out of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">house of the Temple </span>treasury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>If the stolen items were <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility, </span>the thief who steals them <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay the double payment, as well as the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters or sells them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Since the owner must replace the animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">one applies </span>to this case the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and it was stolen from the house of the man.” But </span>if the stolen animals are those for <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the double payment and from the fourfold and fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as one does not apply </span>to this case the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and it was stolen from the house of the man.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Now, we have heard </span>elsewhere <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning Rabbi Shimon that he said: </span>An act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that is not fit </span>for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>at all. And if the thief slaughtered the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animal he stole, this <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that is not fit </span>for accomplishing its full ritual purpose, as it does not render the animal’s meat fit for consumption, in light of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that it is prohibited to eat a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the Temple.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished, inside </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner. </span>In this case, its meat may be eaten.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>by slaughtering and sacrificing the sacrificial animal on behalf of the owner, it is as though the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal, </span>i.e., the animal itself, has been <span class="gemarra-regular">returned to the owner, </span>and the fourfold or fivefold payment should no longer apply. The owner had designated the animal as his offering, and it was in fact used for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avin said </span>in response: This is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span>animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">blood was spilled </span>before it could be sprinkled on the altar. Consequently, the owner did not achieve atonement through this offering, which is why it is not considered as though the animal has been returned to the owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he cited a different version of this answer, and said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished, inside </span>the Temple, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not for the sake of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case is that the animal’s meat may be eaten but the owner has not fulfilled his obligation with this offering. In such a case, the slaughter of the animal does render its meat fit for consumption. Yet, it is not considered as though the animal has been returned to the owner. 

Daf 76b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says </span>yet another explanation as to why the principal has not been returned to the owner: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters blemished </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Temple. A blemished animal may be slaughtered outside the Temple and its meat may be eaten, provided that it is redeemed with money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar wondered about this </span>discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the explanations attributed to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>which are based on the assumption that this is referring to slaughtering a sacrificial animal inside the Temple, is it the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>of the animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for consumption? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of the blood that <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? </span>It is prohibited to eat sacrificial meat immediately after the slaughter; only after the sprinkling of the blood is it permitted to consume the meat. As the slaughter itself does not render the animal’s meat permitted, there should be no liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
Rabbi Elazar continues: And <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, </span>who states that the case is referring to the slaughter of a consecrated blemished animal outside the Temple, is it the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering</span> of the animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for consumption? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption </span>of the animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? </span>Since the thief slaughtered a sacrificial animal, it is prohibited to eat its meat until its sanctity is removed by redeeming it with money. Once again, the slaughter itself does not render the meat permitted, and here too, there should be no liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara comments: Apparently, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>following statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon escaped</span> Rabbi Elazar, who asked these questions. Rabbi Shimon holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be sprinkled is considered </span>as though it had already been <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled, and </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be redeemed is considered </span>as if it had already been <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara proves that Rabbi Shimon maintains these two opinions. Rabbi Shimon holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be sprinkled is considered </span>as though it had already been <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: There are </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">leftover </span>sacrificial meat <span class="gemarra-regular">after the time allotted for its consumption [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the meat is susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food, and there are </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">leftover </span>sacrificial meat in which the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If sacrificial meat was disqualified due to the fact that it <span class="gemarra-regular">remained overnight, </span>i.e., after the allotted time for that offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>of its blood, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food, </span>as it was never fit for consumption. According to Rabbi Shimon, for an item to be susceptible to contracting ritual impurity of food it must have been permitted for consumption or benefit, either at present or at some point in the past. Sacrificial meat may not be consumed before the sprinkling of its blood, nor may it be consumed if it had been left over after a specific period of time, in most cases overnight. If it was disqualified by being left overnight before its blood had been sprinkled, there was never a time when the meat was permitted. By contrast, if the meat was disqualified by being left over <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>of the blood, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food, </span>as it was permitted for consumption at some point after the sprinkling of the blood.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we maintain, </span>as a result of a discussion recorded in tractate <span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> (101b): <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>of the blood? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit for sprinkling. </span>And what is meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>of the blood? This means <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit for sprinkling, </span>i.e., immediately subsequent to the slaughter.
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the case in which the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">remained overnight before </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit for sprinkling? </span>Since the blood is fit for sprinkling almost immediately after the animal’s slaughter, how is it possible for the meat to become <span class="it-text">notar</span> before that stage? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was not enough time in the day to sprinkle </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he slaughtered </span>the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately prior to sunset. </span>The blood was never fit for sprinkling, as the act of sprinkling must be performed before sunset. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case the meat is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food, </span>as there was never a time when it was permitted for consumption.
What is the case where the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">remained overnight after </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit for sprinkling? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">when there was </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">in the day </span>after the slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">to sprinkle </span>the blood, and therefore the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food. </span>The Gemara states its conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Evidently, </span>Rabbi Shimon maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be sprinkled is considered </span>as though it had already been <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Shimon holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be re-deemed is considered </span>as though it is already <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>

Daf 77a

The meat of the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">contracting ritual impurity of food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the fact that it is prohibited to derive benefit from such meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it had a time when it was fit </span>for consumption. 

Daf 77b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says, </span>in explanation of Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon would say</span> that the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer can be redeeme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with money even when it has already been slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">upon its pyre, </span>i.e., for the sake of purification. For this reason Rabbi Shimon claimed that the meat had a time when it was fit for consumption, as it can be rendered permitted for consumption through redemption. The Gemara states its conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Evidently, </span>Rabbi Shimon holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ready to be redeemed is considered </span>as though it has already been <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed.</span>
The Gemara discusses the relative merits of the answers provided by Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Rabbi Yoḥanan did not state </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, </span>i.e., Reish Lakish, that the mishna is referring to a blemished animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he wants to interpret the mishna </span>as dealing with all kinds of sacrificial animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">even with unblemished </span>ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">But what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish did not state </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan?</span>
Reish Lakish could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that the verse states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughters it or sells it” </span>(Exodus 21:37). This verse compares slaughtering to selling, thereby indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>of a particular animal <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>likewise applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, and anywhere that </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>of an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span> either. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">since when one sells sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">sale, </span>and no fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred, so too, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>fourfold or fivefold payment for their <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> these two Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">follow their </span>own lines of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning. As it was stated: According to the statement of Rabbi Shimon </span>that an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter at all and does not entail liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, in the case of a thief who <span class="gemarra-regular">sells </span>a stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">animal with a wound</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that will cause it to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he sells the animal rather than slaughters it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish says: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for the slaughter </span>of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, as its meat may not be eaten, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. And Reish Lakish says </span>that the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>as, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> according to Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>either.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., a sheep-goat hybrid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered it, </span>or if he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sold it, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. What, is it not </span>correct to say that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which mentions the case of selling a stolen <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> but not slaughtering it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon? Apparently, </span>according to Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>nevertheless applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">sale.</span>
Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. Rather, it follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Shimon and maintain that a thief is liable for the fourfold or fivefold payment for slaughtering an animal even if the act of slaughter does not render its meat fit for consumption, as in the case of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>why does it mention the sale of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> but not its slaughter? According to the opinion of the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter? </span>This is certainly not the case.
The Gemara responds with a counter-question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>would you say, that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon? </span>The same difficulty could be raised in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, </span>as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mentions the animal’s slaughter but not its sale: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the fourfold of fivefold payment applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of an animal of diverse kinds, while <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">sale? </span>There is certainly no difference between slaughtering and selling in this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one cannot make such inferences from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>liability with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>of diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. </span>If so, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis as well: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>liability with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>Once the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is interpreted in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis and not that of Rabbi Shimon, it has no bearing on the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>and that is why it referred specifically to the sale of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it </span>necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> manner, that of selling, it maintained the same style of presentation and <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds in </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> manner, that of slaughtering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>there is no reason for it to present just one scenario in either case. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them and teach them </span>in a single sentence: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one stole </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span> and then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>either one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>The Gemara concludes: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>according to the opinion of Reish Lakish.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment in the case of an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds. </span>The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah: “If a man steals an ox or <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Exodus 21:37), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava says, </span>concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the <span class="it-text">seh</span> of a sheep, and the <span class="it-text">seh</span> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes a paradigm </span>for other cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude only </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds. </span>The Hebrew word <span class="it-text">seh</span> denotes either a sheep or a goat. A hybrid, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <span class="it-text">seh</span>. Why, then, is the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable to one who stole this kind of animal?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different here, </span>in the case of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states “or” </span>(Exodus 21:37), a term that could have been avoided, as explained earlier (67b). This extra word serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, </span>i.e., the sheep-goat hybrid.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">every</span> instance of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>diverse kinds? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother and from the eighth day onward it may be accepted as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“a bull or a sheep” </span>serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., an animal of diverse kinds may not be brought as an offering. The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“or a goat” </span>serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles </span>another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of two sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response: The derivation from the word “or” depends on the verse in question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>it is interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">based on the context of the verse, and there, </span>it is also interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">based on the context</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the verse. Here, with regard to theft, </span>the reason the word “or” serves as an inclusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “An ox or a sheep,” </span>which are two animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from which you cannot produce diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they cannot procreate together, and therefore the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to sacrificial </span>animals, the reason the word “or” serves as an exclusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written “sheep” and “goat,” </span>which are two animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from which you can produce diverse kinds. </span>Consequently, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“or” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>diverse kinds. 

Daf 78a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to sacrificial </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">it is also stated </span>in the first part of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A bull or a sheep” </span>(Leviticus 22:27), which are two animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you cannot produce diverse kinds. And </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us include </span>an animal of diverse kinds as being fit for sacrifice on the altar on that account. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the verse: “Or a goat,” serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar, it may be inferred that the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause: </span>“A bull or a sheep,” also serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>one could equally argue that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first clause </span>of the verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar, the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that both expressions serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>types of animals from being fit for sacrifice on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">two exclusions were necessary: </span>One exclusion is referring to diverse kinds and the other is referring to an animal that resembles another species, <span class="gemarra-regular">as even though </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds is excluded, it was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to exclude </span>an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles </span>another. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that both phrases serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>types of animals as being fit for sacrifice on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">why are two inclusions </span>required? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds has been included, </span>in the first inclusion, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to say that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles </span>another is also included? There is more justification for including an animal that resembles another, whose parentage is entirely of one species, than for including an animal of diverse kinds.
The Gemara has established that when the Torah uses the word <span class="it-text">seh</span> (Exodus 21:37) in the context of theft it does not serve to exclude animals of diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>what is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rava says </span>with regard to the verse: “The ox, the <span class="it-text">seh</span> of a sheep, and the <span class="it-text">seh</span> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <span class="gemarra-regular">this establishes a paradigm </span>for other cases, teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated</span> in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude only </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds. With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> did Rava state this principle? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this principle is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written explicitly with regard to them: “A bull or a sheep” </span>(Leviticus 22:27), which, as taught in the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude diverse kinds.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this principle is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> concerning which it is written: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<span class="it-text">tzon</span>], any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), this principle is not necessary either. The reason is that the exclusion of diverse kinds can be <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“under” </span>in this verse, and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“under” </span>in a verse that deals with <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificial </span>animals: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27). This verbal analogy, from which many <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of animal tithe are derived, indicates that diverse kinds are not subject to animal tithe, just as they cannot be used for an offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> this principle is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to firstborn </span>animals, concerning which it is written: “However, the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or <span class="it-text">seh</span>, it is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 27:26), it is not necessary in that context either. The reason is that this can be <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by a verbal analogy between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">passing, </span>in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to the Lord all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term <span class="gemarra-regular">passing, from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe: </span>“And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, you </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that an animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles </span>another is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “But the firstborn of a bull, </span>or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy” (Numbers 18:17). This indicates that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the firstborn are not applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the fathering animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is a bull </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">its firstborn is also a bull. </span>This excludes an animal that resembles another species, rather than its father. Once it is established that an animal that resembles another is not subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a firstborn, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the Torah to state the same with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds? </span>Since it is evident that firstborn status does not apply to diverse kinds, Rava’s principle is not required here either.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava’s </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to </span>the redemption of <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn donkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> concerning which it is written: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a <span class="it-text">seh</span>” (Exodus 13:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 12a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not redeem </span>a firstborn donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">neither with a calf, nor with a non-domesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered </span>animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span> animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with diverse kinds, </span>i.e., a sheep-goat hybrid, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava’s principle is referring to the source for the prohibition against using an animal of diverse kinds for the redemption of a firstborn donkey.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what about <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, who</span> disagrees with this ruling and <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>the use <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>an animal of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>for the redemption of a firstborn donkey? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar permits diverse kinds </span>for use in the redemption of a firstborn donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is Rava’s principle relevant?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Rava’s </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard to a non-kosher </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that was born from a kosher </span>mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose impregnation was from a non-kosher </span>animal. Rava is saying that this animal is not kosher. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, as, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua,</span> although he would agree with this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he derives </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> (see <span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 7a) <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sheep [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kevasim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">seh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of goats [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">izzim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”</span> (Deuteronomy 14:4). The plural forms “<span class="it-text">kevasim</span>” and “<span class="it-text">izzim</span>” indicate that a lamb is not kosher <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">its father is a sheep and its mother is a ewe, </span>and the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to a kid.
The Gemara asks with regard to the case under discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But can a kosher</span> animal <span class="gemarra-regular">become impregnated by a non-kosher </span>animal in the first place? Is it even possible for this to occur? Why did Rabbi Yehoshua and Rava have to find a biblical source to deem this offspring as non-kosher? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it is possible. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we maintain </span>elsewhere (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 7a) 

Daf 78b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mother animal <span class="gemarra-regular">became impregnated from </span>an animal with <span class="gemarra-regular">non-cloven </span>hooves that was born from a kosher mother and father. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who maintains that the offspring resulting from this, which does not have cloven hooves, is not kosher. Since the animal’s father is not kosher according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, the offspring is also not kosher, in accordance with Rava’s principle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside a bull </span>for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole </span>the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">can the thief exempt himself </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>repaying the owner with <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, or by </span>repaying him with a bird to be used as <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird burnt-offering, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 107a): If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering, he must bring </span>a bull or <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep </span>as a burnt-offering to fulfill his vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: He may </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a turtledove or a young pigeon </span>as a burnt-offering.
Rava elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted upon himself </span>to sacrifice an animal with the <span class="gemarra-regular">status of a burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case any animal that fulfills this requirement will suffice? If so, the thief may compensate the owner with a sheep or bird, as the owner can sacrifice that animal as a burnt-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps</span> the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">I want to perform </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the optimal manner, </span>which is by sacrificing a bull. Therefore, you must pay me back with a bull.
<span class="gemarra-regular">After he raised the dilemma, </span>Rava himself <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently resolved it: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">thief can exempt himself </span>from liability by repaying the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>repaying him with a bird to be used as <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird burnt-offering, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, teaches </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly, </span>i.e., without the question-and-answer format: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>With regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering, and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a bull </span>for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came and stole </span>the bull, the thief can <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt himself </span>from liability <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>repaying the owner with <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, or by </span>repaying him with a bird to be used as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bird burnt-offering, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>a stolen animal in a partial fashion, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">one-hundredth of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which he kept for himself; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he had a partnership in </span>owning the animal before stealing it; or in the case of a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who slaughtered </span>the stolen animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and it became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> non-kosher </span>meat <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> because he slaughtered it improperly; or in the case of a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who ripped open </span>the animal rather than slaughtering it halakhically; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>in the case of a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who tore loose </span>the gullet or windpipe of the animal as he slaughtered it, rendering the slaughter invalid, in all these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment but does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>The fourfold or five-fold payment applies only if the animal is entirely sold or if it is slaughtered in accordance with the halakhic definition of animal slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the mishna mean when it states that the thief sold the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">one-hundredt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of it? </span>Which part of the animal must the thief keep for himself for him to be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The mishna means that he sold it <span class="gemarra-regular">except for some </span>part of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that becomes permitted through </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>This does not apply to horns or a sheep’s fleece, which do not require slaughter in order to be used. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Levi says: </span>The mishna’s statement applies even if the thief sold the entire animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fleece. And it is likewise taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The thief is exempt even if he sells the whole animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fleece.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rav from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the whole animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its foreleg, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its hind leg, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its horn, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fleece, he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If the thief sells the animal except for some <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of it whose absence <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he leaves out from the sale a part of the animal whose absence <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate the slaughter, he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>If an animal is missing one of its vital organs, e.g., its liver, one of its intestines, its gullet, or its windpipe, it is considered already dead and its slaughter at this stage would be invalid. For the thief to be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment on the grounds of an incomplete sale, he must retain one of these organs for himself.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If the thief sells the whole animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its horn, he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>If he sells the whole animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fleece, he does pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
The Gemara explains the objection from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not present a difficulty, as his ruling is exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>it does present a difficulty, as in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion does his ruling accord? None of the three opinions expressed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> correlate with that of Rav.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the entire animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its foreleg or except for its hind leg, he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>If he sold the entire animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its horn </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fleece, he does pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the four opinions of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> presented in these <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that when the Torah states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“and slaughters it” </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>him to slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it</span> for him to incur liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Likewise, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“or sells it” </span>teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require</span> him to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it, </span>not leaving any portion at all for himself, even the fleece.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“and slaughters it” </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">parts </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>affected <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, </span>which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude parts </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not </span>affected <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>When the Torah immediately adds the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“or sells it,” </span>this indicates that selling is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to slaughter. </span>Consequently, if the sale excludes the animal’s fleece or horns, i.e., those parts that are not affected by slaughter, there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds, </span>according to the first version of his opinion, that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">horn, which is not meant to be cut off </span>in the animal’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding </span>if the thief keeps that part for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">fleece, which is meant to be cut off </span>in the animal’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding </span>if the thief keeps it for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he must pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the school of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds </span>that the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forelegs and hind legs, which require slaughter </span>for them to be put to their usual use, i.e., for eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span> considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding </span>if the thief keeps one of them for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">its horns and its fleece, which do not require slaughter</span> in order to be used, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding </span>if the thief keeps them for himself.
The Gemara asks: This presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty, </span>as there is a contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar and </span>another opinion presented in the name <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. </span>The Gemara answers: The two rulings represent the reports of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>they disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals </span>an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">missing a limb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lame, or </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">blind, </span>and he subsequently sold it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly, one who steals an animal </span>belonging to several <span class="gemarra-regular">partner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and he subsequently sold it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who stole </span>an animal together and sell it are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to the contrary, that several <span class="gemarra-regular">partners who stole </span>an animal together and sell it are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that he is exempt, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">partner who stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>partner. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that he is liable, it is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partner, who, </span>together with other thieves, <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>someone else <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>their group.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partner who stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>partner and slaughtered it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">partners who </span>jointly <span class="gemarra-regular">stol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> an animal and one of them slaughtered it, <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. To counter this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And slaughters it,” </span>which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>liability for slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it, and </span>in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>so. One who steals an animal that he partly owns is not liable for slaughtering his own portion. Likewise, when several partners steal an animal, the one who slaughters it is not liable for slaughtering the portions of his fellow thieves.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said </span>a different resolution of the contradiction: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>Both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are speaking of partners who together stole an animal from someone else. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the thief is liable, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a partner who slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge </span>and consent <span class="gemarra-regular">of another </span>partner. In such a case the one slaughtering is acting as the agent of the partner as well and is fully liable for the slaughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the thief is exempt, it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of a partner who slaughtered </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">without the knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another </span>partner in the theft. Consequently, the one slaughtering is acting solely on his own and is not liable for the slaughter of his partner’s share, which is why he is exempt from any payment.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raises </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemmas: </span>If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">except for thirty days, </span>i.e., the thief reserved the right to use the animal himself for thirty days before the sale takes effect, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he sold it <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its work</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he stipulated with the buyer that any work the animal performs would be for the thief’s own benefit and profit, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If he stole a pregnant animal and sold it <span class="gemarra-regular">except for its fetus, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara elaborates on the last dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the one who says that a fetus is </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">its mother’s thigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a part of its mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">you should not raise the dilemma, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is clear that the thief, by retaining the fetus, <span class="gemarra-regular">has withheld </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">When you should raise the dilemma, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says that a fetus is not </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">its mother’s thigh, </span>i.e., it has the status of an independent being. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say that since it is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the mother, if the thief keeps the fetus for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding? Or perhaps, since it stands to become detached from </span>the mother <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who state </span>a different analysis of this dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>a fetus is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">its mother’s thigh, it is not </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">withholding, or perhaps, since </span>it needs its mother <span class="gemarra-regular">to be rendered permitted </span>for consumption <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the mother’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, it is considered as though </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">has withheld a part of the </span>mother’s <span class="gemarra-regular">body. </span>The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">severed </span>one of its limbs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the essential factor is that part of <span class="gemarra-regular">what he stole he has not sold, </span>as the missing limb was not sold, and therefore he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the essential factor is that with regard to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which he sold he has not withheld </span>any part for himself. Once again, the Gemara states that this dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave it to another and </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it </span>for him, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave it to another and </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it </span>for him, the thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, as performing these actions through an agent is equivalent to performing them by oneself. 

Daf 79a

The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and consecrated </span>it, or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on credit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., without receiving any money for it at the time, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and exchanged </span>it for another item, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave it </span>to another <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>used it to <span class="gemarra-regular">repay his debt, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal and used it to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>for an item <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>purchased on <span class="gemarra-regular">credit, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and sent it in </span>the form of <span class="gemarra-regular">presents </span>to his betrothed <span class="gemarra-regular">in his father-in-law’s house,</span> in all of these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment, </span>as these acts are all considered forms of selling. This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>All of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> it states are obvious. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause teaches us, </span>through the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave it to another and </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>or sold it on his behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is agency for transgression. Even though in the entire Torah </span>there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no agency for transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here there is agency for transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Torah’s principle is that a transgression committed by an agent who was appointed by another person is not considered the act of the one who appointed the agent, but the independent act of the agent himself. The case discussed by this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is an exception to the rule, as here, the agent’s slaughter or sale of the animal is legally considered the action of the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that this case is an exception to the principle? It is because the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And slaughters it or sells it” </span>(Exodus 21:37), which juxtaposes the two acts of slaughtering and selling. This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>one becomes liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">selling, which</span> by definition <span class="gemarra-regular">is impossible without another </span>party, i.e., the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too one becomes liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>even when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of another </span>party, i.e., when the thief instructs another person to slaughter the animal on his behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>a novelty in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>it. The novelty is that this is considered a sale despite the fact that there is no purchaser. This is due to the following argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ordinary </span>person, and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is it to me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it to Heaven </span>by consecrating it? If the animal changes ownership, it is considered a sale, and it does not matter if the new owner is an ordinary person or the Temple treasury.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owner’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he took hold of it or established control over it but had not yet removed it from the owner’s premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain; or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain; or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">or sold </span>it, and all of this occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain, </span>in all of these cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughtered or sold </span>it, and all of this occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from any of the fines for theft, as it is not considered theft until the stolen object is actually removed from the owner’s premises.
If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>in the process of <span class="gemarra-regular">leading </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and leavin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the owner’s premises, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it died </span>while it was still <span class="gemarra-regular">in the owner’s domain, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he lifted it up or led it out of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain and </span>then the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for his theft. For an act to be considered theft, the thief must acquire the item by pulling it or moving it, which are ineffective forms of acquisition on the owner’s premises; or by lifting it up, which is effective even when performed in the owner’s domain.
If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the animal as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for the redemption of his firstborn son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to a creditor, </span>or conveyed it for safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee, </span>or lent it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a borrower,</span> or conveyed it for safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">to a paid bailee, or </span>leased it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a renter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he was leading out </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and it died in the owner’s domain, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment. If that individual, following the thief’s instructions, <span class="gemarra-regular">lifted up </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or led it out of the owner’s domain, and it </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for the theft. The thief is liable for instructing another to remove the animal for the purposes of payment of a debt, safekeeping, borrowing, or rental, as this is tantamount to the thief taking it with his own hands.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar raises a dilemma: </span>Did the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">institute </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> or leading an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to bailees, or not? </span>When an animal or other item is purchased, the parties to the sale are not bound by the deal until the purchaser performs an act of acquisition, one of which is pulling the animal or leads it along. Did the Sages institute an ordinance that the same applies to bailees? In other words, does the bailee’s obligation to safeguard the animal or item begin as soon as he consents to watch it, or only after he has taken the animal and moved it even minimally?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the animal as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for the redemption of his firstborn son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to a creditor,</span> or conveyed it for safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">to an unpaid bailee, </span>or lent it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a borrower, </span>or conveyed it for safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">to a paid bailee, or </span>rented it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a renter, and he was leading out </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and it died in the owner’s domain, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>talking about the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee </span>leading out the animal, when it states that the thief is exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this mishna that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling with regard to bailees. </span>If the bailee’s obligation begins immediately upon his consent to watch over the item, it would be considered stolen by the thief at that stage, even before the bailee moves it.
Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yeimar: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not necessarily the correct interpretation of the mishna. The mishna may mean that the owner gave the animal to his creditor or to a bailee, and subsequently a thief came to steal it from the house of the creditor or the bailee, and it was the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief </span>who was leading the animal out of those premises when it died.
Rav Yeimar asked: How can that clause of the mishna refer to an animal that died as the thief was leading it out? The mishna already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause. </span>Ameimar answered: Nevertheless, it is possible that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from its owner’s house, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>it again with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief who stole </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from a bailee’s house.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to </span>Ameimar: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not reject</span> Rav Yeimar’s argument by means of this alternative interpretation of the mishna. It is not reasonable to assert that the mishna taught this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> twice, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief stole </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the bailee’s house </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief stole </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the owner’s house? </span>There is no halakhic distinction between these two cases. Therefore, the mishna would not have discussed both of them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>more reasonable to say that the mishna should be interpreted as meaning that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee</span> was leading the animal out of the owner’s house at the behest of the thief, as Rav Yeimar claimed? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, one should <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to bailees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that they did. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was also stated </span>explicitly that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Just as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling with regard to purchasers, so too </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling with regard to bailees.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling with regard to purchasers, so too </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling with regard to bailees. And just as land is acquired by </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>the writing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed </span>of sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">or by </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of the land through working it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too a rental</span> deal is finalized <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">money, by </span>the writing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed </span>of rent, <span class="gemarra-regular">or by </span>the renter <span class="gemarra-regular">taking possession </span>of the land. This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara asks: When the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> speaks of rental, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">rental of what </span>kind of property? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say</span>

Daf 79b

it is speaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">the rental of movable property, is movable property </span>subject to the writing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a deed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rental of land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: </span>If people <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">who was hiding in the wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> near a herd of grazing animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that individual emerged and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>one of the animals from the herd, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is the thief liable to the fourfold or fivefold payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">But he did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pull </span>the animal. Rabbi Elazar is apparently describing a case where the thief emerged from the forest and slaughtered one of the animals without first moving it, and there is no fourfold or fivefold payment unless the thief first steals the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he hit </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">with a stick, </span>causing it to move.
With regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: But since </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">saw him </span>doing all this, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a robber, </span>not a thief, and the fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to thieves. A thief is one who sneaks into a house or other private property; one who commits his act brazenly, in public, is classified as a robber. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he was hiding from them, he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, </span>despite the fact that they saw him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if so, what are the circumstances </span>of a <span class="gemarra-regular">robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abbahu said: </span>Robbers are <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Benaiah ben Jehoiada, as it is stated </span>concerning him: “He slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he robbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear” </span>(II Samuel 23:21).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>A different example of a robber is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the men of Shechem, as it is stated: “And the men of Shechem set ambushers for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them” </span>(Judges 9:25).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu did not say </span>the example <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>verse, which discusses the men of Shechem? He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Since </span>the men of Shechem <span class="gemarra-regular">were hiding </span>in ambush, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> but thieves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>respond to this claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they were hiding </span>was not because they were hesitant to steal in view of the public. Rather, they acted in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">should not see them </span>in advance <span class="gemarra-regular">and flee from them.</span>
§ The Gemara concludes its discussion of theft with several aggadic statements. <span class="gemarra-regular">His students asked Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: For what reason was the Torah stricter with a thief than with a robber? </span>Only a thief is required to pay the double, fourfold, or fivefold payment, not a robber. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">This one, </span>the robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">equated the honor of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">servant to the honor of his Master, and that one, </span>the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not equate the honor of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">servant to the honor of his Master. </span>The robber fears neither God nor people, as he is not afraid to rob in public. The thief does not fear God but he does fear other people, which demonstrates that he is more concerned about humans than God.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it were, </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes the eye below, </span>i.e., God’s eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">as though it does not see, and the ear below, </span>i.e., God’s ear, <span class="gemarra-regular">as though it does not hear. </span>The Gemara cites verses that describe people who imagine that God does not see their actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, </span>and they say: Who sees us, and who knows us?” (Isaiah 29:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And they say: The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed” </span>(Psalms 94:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “For they say: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see” </span>(Ezekiel 9:9).
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: </span>To illustrate the severity of a thief over a robber, as per Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">they stated a parable in the name of Rabban Gamliel. To what is this matter comparable? To two people who were </span>living <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">city, and </span>both of them <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared a feast. One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">invited the people of the city </span>to his feast <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not invite the king’s sons. And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">did not invite the people of the city and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">did not invite the king’s sons. Which of them </span>deserves <span class="gemarra-regular">a greater punishment? You must say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who invited the people of the city but did not invite the king’s sons. </span>Likewise, both the thief and the robber show disdain for God, but the robber does not display more respect for people.
The Gemara discusses why there is a fourfold payment for a sheep but a fivefold payment for an ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: Come and see how great the power of labor is. </span>The theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, which </span>was forced <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">to cease its labor, </span>leads to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fivefold </span>payment; whereas the theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sheep, which </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>forced <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">to cease its labor, </span>as a sheep performs no labor, leads to only <span class="gemarra-regular">a fourfold</span> payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Come and see how great human dignity is. </span>The theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox, which walked on its own legs </span>as the thief stole it, leads to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fivefold </span>payment, whereas the theft of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheep, which </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">carried on his shoulder </span>as he walked, thereby causing himself embarrassment, leads to only <span class="gemarra-regular">a fourfold </span>payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not raise small domesticated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., sheep and goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>settled areas of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yisrael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they graze on people’s crops. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may raise </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in Syria, </span>despite the fact that with regard to many other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> Syria is treated like Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wildernes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Eretz Yisrael.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One may not raise chickens in Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to the sacrificial meat </span>that is common there. There is a concern that chickens will pick up garbage that imparts ritual impurity and bring it into contact with sacrificial meat, thereby rendering it ritually impure. <span class="gemarra-regular">And priests may not </span>raise chickens anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">in Eretz Yisrael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because of the </span>many foods in a priest’s possession that must be kept <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure, </span>e.g., <span class="it-text">teruma</span>.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not raise pig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anywhere, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may not raise a do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless it is tied with chains. One may spread out traps [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nishovim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for pigeons only if </span>this was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">at a distance of</span> at least <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ris</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is 8,000 cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">settled area, </span>to ensure that privately owned pigeons are not caught in the traps.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not raise small domesticated animals, </span>i.e., sheep and goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>settled areas of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the forests of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria, </span>it is permitted to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even in a settled area. And, needless to say, </span>it is permitted to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not raise small domesticated animals in </span>settled areas of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the wilderness that is in Jude</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in the wilderness that is on the border near Akko</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And even though </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, nevertheless, one may raise large, domesticated animals, </span>i.e., cattle, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">issue a decree upon the public onl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</span>
This difference is that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>for someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring small domesticated animals from outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael in the event that they are needed. But it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not possible </span>for someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring large, domesticated animals from outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael whenever he needs one, since there is a constant need for them as beasts of burden. Therefore, the Sages did not issue a decree with regard to these types of animals.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though they said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, however, one may keep </span>these animals on his premises for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival, and thirty days before the </span>wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast of one’s son, </span>when many animals are needed for food, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not leave the last </span>one, i.e., the animal which he purchased immediately before the Festival, for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the final line of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> needs to state this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say that if the pilgrimage Festival has passed and thirty days have not yet elapsed from </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when he bought </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">until now, </span>he may keep the animal until thirty days have elapsed. To counter this, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say: It is permitted to keep it for </span>a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days. Rather, once the pilgrimage Festival has passed, he should not keep it </span>any longer. 

Daf 80a

The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a butcher may bu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> small domesticated animals <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter </span>them, and again <span class="gemarra-regular">buy </span>small domesticated animals <span class="gemarra-regular">and keep </span>them for a while, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not keep the last one of them </span>that he bought beyond <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">His students asked Rabban Gamliel: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to raising </span>small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael? Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: It is permitted. </span>The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to pose a question: How could Rabban Gamliel say this? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not raise </span>small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the text of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be emended, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">raised this dilemma before him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> keeping </span>them for a while? The Gemara resumes the quotation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, provided that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">does not go out and graze among the flock. Rather, </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">tie it to the legs of the bed </span>in his house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain pious man who was groaning, </span>i.e., suffering, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a pain in <span class="gemarra-regular">his heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Those caring for the man <span class="gemarra-regular">asked the physicians </span>what to do for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said: There is no other remedy for him but that he should suckle warm milk every morning. And they brought him a she-goat and tied it to the leg of the bed for him, and he would suckle </span>milk <span class="gemarra-regular">from it every morning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Days later, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his friends came in to visit him. When they saw that she-goat tied to the legs of the bed, they turned back, saying: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit in this </span>man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house, and we are going in to </span>visit <span class="gemarra-regular">him? </span>They referred to the goat in this manner because small animals habitually graze on the vegetation of others, thereby stealing their crops.
His friends <span class="gemarra-regular">sat down and investigated </span>this pious man’s behavior, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they could not find </span>any sin attributable <span class="gemarra-regular">to him except that si</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span> keeping <span class="gemarra-regular">that she-goat </span>in his house. That man <span class="gemarra-regular">himself also said at the time of his death: I know </span>for a fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that I have no sin </span>attributable <span class="gemarra-regular">to me except </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sin of </span>keeping <span class="gemarra-regular">that she-goat </span>in my house, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I transgressed the statement of my colleagues, </span>the Sages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said: </span>The members of my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s family were among the wealthy property holders in the upper Galilee. And for what reason were they destroyed? </span>It was due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would graze </span>flocks <span class="gemarra-regular">in the forests, and </span>also because they would <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>judge. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though there were forests close to their houses, </span>and therefore there should have been no problem for them to take their animals to graze in these forests, <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a small, </span>private <span class="gemarra-regular">field and they would convey </span>the animals on <span class="gemarra-regular">a path through it.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a shepherd </span>of small domesticated animals <span class="gemarra-regular">who repented</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him to sell </span>all his animals <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, he may sell </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">gradually. And likewise, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert who came into </span>possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs and pigs </span>(see 83a) <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">his inheritance, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him to sell </span>all of them <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately. Rather, he may sell </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">gradually.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vowed to purchase a hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to marry a woman in Eretz Yisrael, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not obligate him to acquire </span>the first house or marry the first woman he sees <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span>upon his arrival in Eretz Yisrael. Instead, he may wait <span class="gemarra-regular">until he finds </span>the house or wife <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate for him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain </span>unmarried <span class="gemarra-regular">woman who had a son who was distressing her, and she jumped up and took an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> impulsively: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who comes </span>to marry me and will discipline my son, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not turn him away. And unworthy men jumped at </span>the opportunity to marry <span class="gemarra-regular">her. And when the matter came before the Sages, they said: </span>She need not marry one of these men, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intention </span>in her oath was certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>marry <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who is appropriate for her.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not raise small domesticated animals, </span>i.e., sheep and goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not raise small undomesticated animals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael says: One may raise village dogs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cats, monkeys, and genets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because they serve to clean the house </span>of mice and other vermin.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are</span> these <span class="gemarra-regular">genets? Rav Yehuda said: </span>These are known in Aramaic as <span class="gemarra-italic">shartza</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥartza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that in Aramaic this animal is called <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This creature <span class="gemarra-regular">has short thighs and it grazes among the thorn bushes. And what </span>is the reason that they are called <span class="gemarra-italic">shartza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a term that generally refers to creeping creatures that slither [<span class="it-text">shoretz</span>] rather than walk? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because its thighs are </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">short </span>that it appears to slither instead of walking on legs.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: We in Babylonia have rendered ourselve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrae</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the prohibition of the Sages against raising <span class="gemarra-regular">small domesticated animals. Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rav Huna: What of your </span>sheep and goats? How can you raise these animals in Babylonia?
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Ḥova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> my wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">watches </span>the animals to ensure that they do not graze on land belonging to others. Rav Adda bar Ahava cursed Rav Huna and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: May Ḥova bury her son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">!</span> In <span class="gemarra-regular">all the years of Rav Adda bar Ahava, no children of Rav Huna from Ḥova survived, </span>due to this curse. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of the above statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: We in Babylonia rendered ourselves like </span>those of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>raising <span class="gemarra-regular">small domesticated animals, from </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav came to Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel and Rav Asi </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">happened to be </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">at a house </span>where a celebration was being held marking the passage <span class="gemarra-regular">of a week of </span>a newborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son, </span>i.e., a circumcision. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say it was a house </span>where a celebration was being held marking the <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption of </span>a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son. Rav </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter before Shmuel, </span>for reasons the Gemara will explain; 

Daf 80b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel would not enter before Rav Asi, </span>as he considered Rav Asi to be greater than he; and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi would not enter before Rav, </span>as Rav was his teacher. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: Which </span>of us <span class="gemarra-regular">should stay behind </span>and let the other two come in before him? They decided: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let Shmuel stay behind, and let Rav and Rav Asi come </span>inside in that order. Afterward, Shmuel himself would enter.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why didn’t they decide to <span class="gemarra-regular">let Rav or Rav Asi stay behind? </span>The Gemara explains: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere gesture that Rav performed for Shmuel </span>in initially stating that Shmuel should precede him, as Rav did not really feel that Shmuel was superior to him. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of that incident </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>he inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">cursed </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav took upon himself </span>to treat Shmuel with deference.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the meantime, </span>while all this was going on, <span class="gemarra-regular">a cat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shunara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came and severed the hand of the baby. Rav emerged </span>from the house <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cat, it is permitted to kill i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> even if it is privately owned; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is prohibited to maintain it </span>in one’s possession; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not subject to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>if one takes it from its owner; <span class="gemarra-regular">and, </span>in the case of a lost cat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not subject to </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning a lost item to its owner. </span>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rav’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to kill it, what is </span>the need to state <span class="gemarra-regular">further </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to maintain it </span>in one’s possession? If a cat is considered such a dangerous animal that it is permitted to kill it, of course one cannot keep it in his possession. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that although Rav ruled that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to kill it, </span>he concedes that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no prohibition </span>in keeping it, Rav therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is also prohibited to keep it in one’s possession.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>further questioning Rav’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not subject to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">theft </span>if one takes it from its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the need to state <span class="gemarra-regular">further </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not subject to </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning a lost item to its owner </span>in the case of a lost cat? If one may actively steal a cat, certainly there is no obligation to return it when found. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>in response: Rav was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> against Rav’s ruling that it is prohibited to keep a cat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One may raise village dogs, cats, monkeys, and genets, because they serve to clean the house </span>of mice and other vermin. The Gemara resolves the apparent contradiction: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a black </span>cat, which is harmless, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> ruling of Rav is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a white </span>cat, which is dangerous.
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident of Rav </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was a black </span>cat. Since this cat severed the baby’s hand, it was obviously a vicious, dangerous animal. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There it was a black </span>cat, but it was <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">white </span>one. The offspring of a white cat is dangerous, even if it itself is black. The Gemara further objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Ravina raise this </span>very issue <span class="gemarra-regular">as a dilemma?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Ravina raised a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a black </span>cat that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a white </span>one? Is it also dangerous like its parent? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravina raised the dilemma, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a black </span>cat that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a white </span>cat that itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a black </span>cat. By contrast, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident with Rav </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was a black</span> cat that was <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a white </span>one, which was itself <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of a white </span>cat. That animal is definitely dangerous.
§ The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the distinguishing letters in the various names of the sons of Rav Pappa in the ensuing list: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥet</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">dalet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥet</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa says </span>the following three statements <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Pappa, </span>who said them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Adda bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Pappa, </span>who said them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa, </span>who said them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The three statements are as follows: The court <span class="gemarra-regular">sounds the alar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat over </span>a breakout of <span class="gemarra-regular">sores</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a door that is locked will not be opened quickly; and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael, one writes a bill of sale for </span>this transaction <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: After explaining how the public engages in prayer when there is a drought, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all other types of calamities that break out upon the community, </span>other than drought, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sores, </span>a plague of <span class="gemarra-regular">locusts, flies, hornets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or mosquitoes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or infestations of snakes or scorpions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">would not sound the alarm </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the people would <span class="gemarra-regular">cry out. </span>This indicates that it is not proper to sound the alarm on Shabbat for an epidemic of sores.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to moist </span>sores; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to dry </span>sores, which are more dangerous than moist ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">boils that the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast” </span>(Exodus 9:10). The phrase “breaking out” is referring to the exterior of the wound. Since the verse specifies that the outside was oozing with secretions, it can be inferred that the inside was dry. This indicates that the sores can be of either type.
The Gemara analyzes the second of the three statements: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a door that is locked will not be opened quickly. </span>This is clearly a metaphor, but to <span class="gemarra-regular">what is it </span>referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is a metaphor for rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">ordination</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one meets with resistance in his quest to receive ordination, he should take it as a sign that this opportunity will not soon open up for him again. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is treated poorly will not soon be treated well. Rav Aḥa of Difti said: He will never be treated well. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so; Rav Aḥa of Difti was saying </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter </span>that reflected what had occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara turns its attention to the third statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one writes a bill of sale for </span>this transaction <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat. </span>The Gemara asks: Can it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that one may write this bill of sale <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat? </span>Writing on Shabbat is a prohibited labor for which one is liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava said there, </span>with regard to a similar issue, that one <span class="gemarra-regular">tells a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to do it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does </span>so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>it is referring to a situation where he <span class="gemarra-regular">tells a gentile </span>to write a bill of sale for the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even though telling a gentile </span>to perform an action that is prohibited for a Jew on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>generally a violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic decree, </span>as the Sages prohibited telling a gentile to perform prohibited labor on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat, here <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not </span>impose this <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, due to </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">settling Eretz Yisrael. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a city in Eretz Yisrael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">forces him to purchase a path to </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">its sides, due to </span>the importance of <span class="gemarra-regular">settling Eretz Yisrael.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua stipulated ten conditions </span>when he apportioned Eretz Yisrael among the tribes: 

Daf 81a

The conditions are <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze </span>their animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in forests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even on private property; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">gather wood from </span>each other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fields, </span>to be used as animal fodder; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">gather </span>wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetation </span>for animal fodder in any place <span class="gemarra-regular">except for</span> a field of <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek; and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">pluck off a shoot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere </span>for propagation and planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for olive shoots; and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the city </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">take supplies </span>of water from a spring on private property, even <span class="gemarra-regular">from a spring that emerges for the first time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish in the Sea of Tiberias, </span>i.e., the Sea of Galilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>the fisherman <span class="gemarra-regular">does not build an </span>underwater <span class="gemarra-regular">fenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to catch fish, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">causing an impediment to boats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues the list of Joshua’s ten conditions: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>people shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">relieve themselves </span>outdoors <span class="gemarra-regular">behind a fence, even in a field </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">full of saffron [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karkom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk in permitted paths, </span>i.e., those paths that cut through a private field, throughout the summer <span class="gemarra-regular">until the second rainfall,</span> when crops begin to sprout; <span class="gemarra-regular">and they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">veer off to the sides of the roads </span>onto private property <span class="gemarra-regular">because of hard protrusions </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yeteidot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the road; and one who becomes lost among the vineyards</span> shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down branches and enter </span>an area of the vineyard, or <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down branches and exit </span>an area of the vineyard, until he finds his way back to the road; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse with no one to bury it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] acquires its place </span>and is buried where it was found.
The first condition mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze </span>their animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in forests. Rav Pappa said: We said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>domesticated animals, i.e., sheep or goats, that graze <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a forest of <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>trees. Small animals grazing in a forest of this kind would not destroy it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>animals grazing <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a forest with <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>growth, or <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>animals, e.g., oxen, grazing <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a forest of <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>trees, these practices are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted, as in either of these scenarios the practice would destroy the forest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, all the more so, </span>it is understood <span class="gemarra-regular">that large </span>animals grazing <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a forest with <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>growth is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted.
The Gemara discusses the next condition mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">gather wood from </span>each other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">fields</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to be used as animal fodder. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to </span>twigs of <span class="gemarra-regular">thorns and shrubs, </span>as the field’s owner does not care about these. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even with regard to </span>twigs of <span class="gemarra-regular">thorn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and shrubs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">But when </span>they have been <span class="gemarra-regular">detached </span>by the owner it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted, as he has already claimed them for himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And even when</span> they are <span class="gemarra-regular">attached we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the twigs are still <span class="gemarra-regular">moist, but when </span>they are completely <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted, as the owner requires these for firewood. Moreover, it is permitted only <span class="gemarra-regular">provided</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one does not uproot </span>the thorn bush or shrub from the ground, but it is prohibited to pull them out with their roots.
The Gemara further discusses Joshua’s conditions: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">gather </span>wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for animal fodder in any place <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>a field of <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetation is good for fenugreek, </span>and therefore the owner wants it to be left in his field? The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna that deals with diverse kinds (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 2:5): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek that sproute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alongside </span>various <span class="gemarra-regular">types of </span>wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetation,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one is not required to uproot </span>the vegetation. Although it is generally prohibited to grow different species of vegetables together in one patch, if the species have a negative impact on each other’s growth, it is not prohibited. In this case the wild vegetation may be left alongside the fenugreek because it is harmful to it, and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of diverse kinds do not apply in a case of this kind.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the mishna is referring to a case where the fenugreek was planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds; there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that lists Joshua’s conditions is referring to fenugreek planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks. </span>When it is planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, </span>wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetation is bad for it, as it weakens </span>the fenugreek and lowers its yield. But when it is planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks, </span>wild vegetation is <span class="gemarra-regular">good for it, as when it is situated among vegetation it climbs on it </span>and thereby grows to a larger size.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead another answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the mishna is referring to a case where the fenugreek was planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for human </span>consumption; and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to fenugreek planted <span class="gemarra-regular">for animal </span>consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sowed </span>the fenugreek <span class="gemarra-regular">for animal</span> consumption, the wild <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetation is also required by him, </span>as this too can be used for animal fodder. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how can we know </span>if a particular fenugreek field was planted for human or animal consumption, and thereby know whether the vegetation may be picked and taken? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>If he planted it <span class="gemarra-regular">in rows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesharei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for human </span>consumption; if he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>plant <span class="gemarra-regular">in rows </span>but planted haphazardly, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">for animal </span>consumption.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">pluck off a shoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anywhere </span>for propagation and planting, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for olive shoots, </span>as this would cause damage to the olive tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tanḥum and Rabbi Berayes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> explained </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of a certain elder: With regard to olive </span>trees, one must distance himself by <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of an eg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> from the trunk before detaching a shoot; in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of reeds and grape vines, </span>he may take shoots only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>place of the first <span class="gemarra-regular">knot and above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all other trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> shoots may be taken only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the thick </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where there are many branches growing, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not from the thin </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tree.</span>
Furthermore, one may take <span class="gemarra-regular">from a new </span>branch, <span class="gemarra-regular">which does not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">produce fruit, but not from old </span>branches, <span class="gemarra-regular">which do produce fruit; </span>and one may take <span class="gemarra-regular">from a place that does not face the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 81b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but not from a place that faces the sun, </span>where the fruits grow copiously, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:14).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the people of the city </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">take supplies </span>of water from a spring on private property, even <span class="gemarra-regular">from a spring that emerges for the first time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Rav Huna says: And </span>although one may draw water from that spring, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give money to </span>reimburse the owner of the property. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with his </span>opinion, as the water may be taken without payment.
The next of Joshua’s conditions is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish in the Sea of Tiberias</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provided that </span>the fisherman <span class="gemarra-regular">does not build an </span>underwater <span class="gemarra-regular">fence </span>to catch fish, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">causing an impediment to boats. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may fish with nets and with traps. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, the tribes stipulated with each other that one may not build </span>an underwater <span class="gemarra-regular">fence </span>to catch fish, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">causing an impediment to boats, but one may fish with nets and with traps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sea of Tiberias was </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the portion of </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Naphtali. Moreover, </span>the tribe of Naphtali <span class="gemarra-regular">received </span>in addition a small stretch of land equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>length of the <span class="gemarra-regular">rope of </span>a fish <span class="gemarra-regular">trap. </span>This stretch of land was located <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south </span>of the sea, where the members of this tribe could spread out their fishing nets, <span class="gemarra-regular">to fulfill that which is stated: </span>“And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord; <span class="gemarra-regular">possess the sea and the south” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:23).
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Detached </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mountains </span>at the time of conquest <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of all the tribes </span>equally, as spoils of war; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">attached, </span>e.g., trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>sole <span class="gemarra-regular">possession of that tribe </span>that would receive the land where the tree was found.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you do not have a single tribe of Israel that did not have </span>in its portion at least some land <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mountains, and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lowland, and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">in the countryside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">in the valley, as it is stated: “Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the countryside, and by the seashore” </span>(Deuteronomy 1:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And you find similarly with regard to the Canaanites and Perizzites and Amorites who </span>inhabited the land <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it stated </span>in the above verse: “The Amorites <span class="gemarra-regular">and to all their neighbors.” Apparently, </span>the Amorites and <span class="gemarra-regular">their neighbors </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">had this </span>variety of types of land in their respective territories.
§ The Gemara discusses the next of Joshua’s conditions: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>people shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">relieve themselves </span>outdoors <span class="gemarra-regular">behind a fence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even in a field </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">full of saffron. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>It goes without saying that one may relieve himself when necessary; this stipulation <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>to permit the one relieving himself <span class="gemarra-regular">to take a stone out of </span>a wall in the field with which to clean himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: And </span>it is permitted to remove a stone from a wall for this purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mar Zutra the Pious would take </span>a stone in this manner on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">and replace </span>it in the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to his attendant </span>after Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and plaster it over, </span>so that it would fit securely back in the wall.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they</span> shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk in permitted paths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., those paths that cut through a private field, throughout the summer <span class="gemarra-regular">until the second rainfall, </span>when crops begin to sprout. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>fields that we have in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">even dew </span>that settled the previous night <span class="gemarra-regular">is bad for them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even after a night of dew, the field is sufficiently moistened that trampling on it will cause damage, and therefore this condition does not apply if there was dew the previous night.
The next item on the list of conditions is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">veer off to the sides of the road</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> onto private property <span class="gemarra-regular">because of hard protrusions of the road. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel and Rav Yehuda, </span>who lived in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">walking along the road, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel veered off to the sides of the road </span>onto private property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said to him: </span>Do the <span class="gemarra-regular">conditions that Joshua stipulated </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even in Babylonia? </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Indeed so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I say </span>that they apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Ḥiyya were </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">walking along the road, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they veered off to the sides of the road. Rabbi Yehuda ben Kanos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taking broad steps </span>on the road, to avoid the protrusions without going off to the side of the road, <span class="gemarra-regular">while walking in front of them. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: Who is this </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who is showing off </span>his supposed <span class="gemarra-regular">greatness in our presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> By acting more stringently than required by <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, he is displaying insolence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is my student Rabbi Yehuda ben Kanosa. And </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his actions are </span>undertaken <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of Heaven; </span>he is not acting out of haughtiness. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they reached him </span>and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">saw him, he said to him: If you were not Yehuda ben Kanosa I would have cut off your legs with iron shears</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I would have excommunicated you for your impudence.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who becomes lost among the vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> shall have the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mefaseig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> branches and enter </span>an area of the vineyard, or <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down branches and exit </span>an area of the vineyard, until he finds his way back to the road. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this stipulation extends further: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sees another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">lost among the vineyards, he may cut down branches and enter </span>an area of the vineyard, or <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down branches and exit </span>an area of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">until he </span>reaches him and <span class="gemarra-regular">brings him </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the city or to the road. And similarly, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself is the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is lost among the vineyards, he may cut down branches and enter </span>an area of the vineyard, or <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down branches and exit</span> an area of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">until he comes </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the city or to the road.</span>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the point of the clause that begins with: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly? </span>It is obvious that a lost individual himself has the same right to cut down branches as one who assists him to find his way out. The Gemara answers: That is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person who is permitted to cut down branches, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, </span>having seen the lost party, <span class="gemarra-regular">he knows </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is going </span>to rescue the other and help him leave the vineyard, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is why <span class="gemarra-regular">he may cut down branches; but </span>with regard to the lost person himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not know where he is going, </span>one might have said that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not cut down branches </span>but must <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>all the way <span class="gemarra-regular">back to the boundary </span>of the vineyard. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that one who is lost may cut down branches in his quest to find his own way to the nearby town or road.
The Gemara asks a further question: Why was it necessary for Joshua to stipulate that one may find his way out in this manner? After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law. </span>When one is lost, whoever can assist in helping him find his way must do so by Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There is a mitzva to return lost items to their owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that the requirement applies even to <span class="gemarra-regular">returning his body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., helping a lost person find his way? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And you shall restore it </span>to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be translated as: And you shall restore himself to him. If this is required by Torah law, why did Joshua stipulate a condition to this effect?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Torah law </span>one is required only to walk in a roundabout path <span class="gemarra-regular">along the boundaries, </span>without damaging another’s vines by cutting off branches. Joshua <span class="gemarra-regular">came and instituted </span>the stipulation <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may </span>go even further and <span class="gemarra-regular">cut off branches and ascend </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">cut off branches and descend, </span>thereby leaving through the most direct route.
The Gemara addresses the last stipulation in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse with no one to bury it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] acquires its plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and is buried where it was found. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds a corpse laid out on a main street [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">isratya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evacuates it </span>for burial either <span class="gemarra-regular">to the right of the street or to the left of the street, </span>but it may not be buried under the main street itself. If one can move the corpse either to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fallow field or </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a plowed field, he evacuates it to the fallow field.</span>
If the choice is between <span class="gemarra-regular">a plowed field and a sown field, he evacuates it to the plowed field. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>fields <span class="gemarra-regular">were fallow, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">sown, he evacuates it to any side where he wishes </span>to move it. According to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, a <span class="it-text">met</span> <span class="it-text">mitzva</span> is not necessarily buried where it is found. It may be moved elsewhere.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai said: </span>The ruling of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a corpse<span class="gemarra-regular"> laid out on the pathway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since permission was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">granted to evacuate it </span>from there, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may evacuate it to any place he wishes. </span>If, however, the corpse was in a field, it would be prohibited to move it.
§ The Gemara returns to the opening statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that Joshua stipulated ten conditions. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Are there really only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten? These </span>conditions enumerated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven. </span>The Gemara answers: The condition that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may walk in permitted paths </span>that cut through a private field in the summer was not instituted by Joshua; rather, King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon said it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s produce was completely </span>harvested <span class="gemarra-regular">from the field, but he does not allow people to enter into his field </span>to shorten their route, <span class="gemarra-regular">what do people say about him? </span>They say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What benefit does so-and-so have </span>by denying entry into his field? <span class="gemarra-regular">And what harm are people causing him </span>by traversing his field? <span class="gemarra-regular">Concerning him, the verse says: Do not be called wicked </span>by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from being good. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">written: Do not be called wicked </span>by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from being good? </span>There is no such verse in the Bible. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>an idea <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>is found in the Bible, albeit in a slightly different form, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written like this: “Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it” </span>(Proverbs 3:27).
The Gemara further questions the statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Joshua instituted ten stipulations: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there nothing more </span>that Joshua instituted? <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>also the stipulation mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: During the time of manure removal, a person may remove his manur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from his property <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public thoroughfare and pile it up </span>there for <span class="gemarra-regular">a full thirty </span>days, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it should be trodden by the feet of people and by the feet of animals, </span>thereby improving its quality, as it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on this condition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua apportioned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people.</span>
The Gemara continues this line of questioning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>the stipulations mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: It is a stipulation of the court, </span>i.e., it is an automatic right even when not explicitly granted, <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>owner of a bee colony <span class="gemarra-regular">may enter the field of another and chop of</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the other’s branch </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to save his </span>bee <span class="gemarra-regular">colony, and </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the other’s </span>severed <span class="gemarra-regular">branch. </span>That is, if a beekeeper finds that one of his colonies has relocated to a tree in a neighboring field, he may bring it back to his own property together with the branch, provided that he later reimburses the owner of the tree.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court that this </span>bearer of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">pours out his win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from his barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>uses the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">to save another’s </span>spilling <span class="gemarra-regular">honey, </span>which is more valuable than the wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wine from the </span>saved <span class="gemarra-regular">honey of the other, </span>as reimbursement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court that this </span>owner of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">unloads his wood </span>from his donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">and loads another’s flax, </span>which is more valuable than wood, if the load of flax is stranded on the road due to a mishap, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wood from the </span>saved <span class="gemarra-regular">flax of that other </span>individual. Once again, the reason is that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on this condition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua apportioned Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people.</span>
The Gemara explains why the stipulations mentioned by Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael are omitted by the earlier <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not speaking of individual </span>opinions, but only of those that are accepted by all the Sages. 

Daf 82a

The Gemara further questions the number of Joshua’s stipulations: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when Rabbi Avin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both a tree that lean</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the field of anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a tree that is close to a boundary </span>with another field, the owner of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>the first fruits of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and recites </span>the accompanying declaration, as described in Deuteronomy 26:5–10, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on this condition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua apportioned Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people. </span>This is an additional stipulation by Joshua, which means that there are more than ten.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, who </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that deals with the <span class="gemarra-regular">ten conditions that Joshua stipulated? It is Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, </span>an <span class="it-text">amora</span>. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan, another <span class="it-text">amora</span>, can disagree with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Geviha from Bei Kati</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly </span>in his version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tanḥum and Rabbi Beraye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say in the name of a certain elder, and who is that </span>elder? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Joshua stipulated ten conditions.</span>
§ The Sages taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ezra </span>the Scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted ten ordinances: </span>He instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>communities <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat in the afternoon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday and Thursday; and </span>the courts convene and <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday and Thursday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one does laundry on Thursday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one eats garlic on Shabbat eve. And </span>Ezra further instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">that a woman should rise early and bak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> bread on those days when she wants to bake; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that a woman should don a breechcloth; and that a woman should </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">comb </span>her hair <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only then <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse </span>in a ritual bath after being ritually impure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that peddlers </span>of cosmetics and perfumes <span class="gemarra-regular">should travel around through </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the towns. And </span>Ezra further <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</span>
The Gemara analyzes these ordinances, the first of which is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>communities <span class="gemarra-regular">shall read </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat afternoon. </span>This Gemara explains that this ordinance was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">due to those who sit </span>idly on street <span class="gemarra-regular">corners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who do not attend the synagogue during the week.
The Gemara discusses the second of Ezra’s ordinances: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that they should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> read </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday and Thursday. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Ezra institute </span>this practice? <span class="gemarra-regular">But it was instituted from the beginning, </span>i.e., long before his time. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; <span class="gemarra-regular">and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water” </span>(Exodus 15:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">Those who interpret verses</span> metaphorically <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>here is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other than Torah, as it is stated </span>metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water” </span>(Isaiah 55:1).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: The verse means that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">traveled for three days without </span>hearing any <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah they became weary, </span>and therefore the <span class="gemarra-regular">prophets among them arose and instituted for them that they should read </span>from the Torah each <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, and pause </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Sunday, and read </span>again on <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday, and pause </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Tuesday and Wednesday, and read </span>again on <span class="gemarra-regular">Thursday, and pause </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat eve, so they would not tarry three days without </span>hearing the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah. </span>Evidently this practice predates Ezra.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially they instituted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one man </span>read <span class="gemarra-regular">three verses; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">alternatively, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">three men </span>read <span class="gemarra-regular">three verses. </span>Either way, the number three <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponds to </span>the three types of Jews: <span class="gemarra-regular">Priests, Levites, and Israelites. </span>Ezra later <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">three men </span>always read, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ten verses </span>altogether be read by them, <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the ten idlers </span>in a city, i.e., the ten men who are paid to spend their time dealing with synagogue and communal matters.
The next ordinance of Ezra is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the courts convene and <span class="gemarra-regular">judge </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday and Thursday. </span>The Gemara explains that the reason for this ordinance is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>many people are <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>in a city on these days, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they come </span>from the countryside <span class="gemarra-regular">for the reading of the </span>holy <span class="gemarra-regular">book, </span>the Torah, which is performed on Mondays and Thursdays, as stated above.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that one should do laundry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Thursday. </span>This was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the need to have clean garments in <span class="gemarra-regular">deference to Shabbat.</span>
The Gemara explains the next listed ordinance: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that one should eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat eve. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that garlic enhances sexual potency, and Friday night is an appropriate time for <span class="gemarra-regular">conjugal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relations. As it is written </span>concerning the righteous: “And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <span class="gemarra-regular">who brings forth his fruit in his season” </span>(Psalms 1:3); <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehuda says, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who engages in sexual intercours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every Shabbat eve.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">five matters were stated with regard to garlic: It satisfies; it warms </span>the body; <span class="gemarra-regular">it causes </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">countenance to shine; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it increases </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sperm, and it kills lice that are in the intestines. And some say </span>that it also <span class="gemarra-regular">instills love </span>into those who eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">and removes jealousy </span>from them.
The next ordinance is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that a woman should rise earl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and bake </span>bread on those days when she bakes. This Gemara explains that this was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">so that bread should be available for poor people, </span>who go begging for bread in the mornings.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that a woman should don a breechcloth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This ordinance was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>reasons of <span class="gemarra-regular">modesty.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that a woman should </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">comb </span>her hair <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only then <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse </span>in a ritual bath. This is to ensure that there is no dirt or other substance in the hair that would invalidate the immersion. The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>Ezra did not institute this.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, concerning a verse that discusses one who must undergo ritual immersion: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall bathe his flesh [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">besaro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in water” </span>(Leviticus 14:9). This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that no substance should interpose between his flesh and the water. </span>When the verse states this in the expanded form of <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his flesh,” </span>using the term “<span class="it-text">et</span>,” this teaches that the water must come into contact even with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is subordinate to his flesh. And what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that? </span>It is one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hair. </span>Accordingly, the Torah itself states that there may not be any interposing substance in the hair at the time of immersion. What, then, did Ezra add?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Torah law </span>one is required <span class="gemarra-regular">to inspec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his or her hair before immersion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>some hairs are <span class="gemarra-regular">knotted </span>together, preventing contact with water at that spot, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>perhaps there is some <span class="gemarra-regular">repulsive substance </span>in his hair. One must perform this inspection <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>these would constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition. </span>

Daf 82b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Ezra <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and added to the Torah’s minimal obligation. He <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">combing </span>the hair even when it is known that it is not knotted and contains no repulsive substance.
The Gemara discusses the next of Ezra’s ordinances: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that peddlers shoul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the towns. </span>This Gemara explains that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>peddlers supply <span class="gemarra-regular">women’s cosmetics</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore Ezra instituted this practice <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">should not become unattractive to their husbands.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the last of the ten ordinances: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he instituted </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">immersio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for those who experienced a seminal emission. </span>The Gemara asks: But this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">his flesh in water”</span> (Leviticus 15:16). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Torah law </span>immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>required only if one wishes to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or sacrificial </span>meat. Ezra <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and further <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>that immersion is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">even for </span>reciting or studying <span class="gemarra-regular">matters of Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that one may not raise chickens in Jerusalem. The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that contains a list of other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that are unique to Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ten matters were state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A house </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>Jerusalem does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">irredeemabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> one year after its sale. Those who sell houses in other walled cities have the right to buy back their property for one year after the transaction. If they fail to do so, the house becomes the permanent possession of the buyer (see Leviticus 25:29–30). This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does not apply to houses in Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>its Elders do <span class="gemarra-regular">not bring a heifer whose neck is broke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as required when a murder victim is found near a city and the murderer is unknown (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9); <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot become an idolatrous city </span>(see Deuteronomy 13:13–19).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues its list: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> a house in Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot become ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprous sores</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one may not build out projections or balconies </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezuztraot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> from houses that are <span class="gemarra-regular">in it; and one may not establish garbage dumps in </span>Jerusalem; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may not build kilns in it; and one may not plant gardens and orchards </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pardesot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in it, except for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rose garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were </span>already there <span class="gemarra-regular">from the times of the early prophets; and one may not raise chickens in it; and </span>finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not leave a corpse overnight in </span>Jerusalem.
The Gemara discusses these ten <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> pertaining to Jerusalem, one by one: <span class="gemarra-regular">A house </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">irredeemable </span>one year after its sale. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: </span>“And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the house </span>that is in the <span class="gemarra-regular">walled </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations” </span>(Leviticus 25:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who taught this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem was not apportioned to </span>any single one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tribes </span>of Israel; rather, it is considered common property. Since no one has ancestral ownership of any house in Jerusalem, its houses cannot be sold permanently.
The Gemara analyzes the next <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>its inhabitants do <span class="gemarra-regular">not bring a heifer whose neck is broken. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “If one is found slain in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">And,</span> again, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who taught this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem was not apportioned to </span>any one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of Israel. Therefore, it is not included in the description: “The land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it.”
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot become an idolatrous city. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written, </span>in the introduction of the passage dealing with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an idolatrous city: “If you shall hear tell concerning one of <span class="gemarra-regular">your cities, </span>which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 13:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who taught this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem was not apportioned to </span>any one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tribes </span>of Israel. It is therefore not included in the description “one of your cities, which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there.”
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a house in Jerusalem does <span class="gemarra-regular">not become ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprous sores. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” </span>(Leviticus 14:34). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who taught this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem was not apportioned to </span>any one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tribes </span>of Israel. It is there-fore not included in the description “a house of the land of your possession.”
The Gemara discusses the next <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not build out projections or balconies </span>from houses that are <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>Jerusalem. The Gemara provides two reasons for this prohibition. First, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the danger of contracting <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>by being in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">tent </span>as a corpse, i.e., under the same roof, in which case the impurity spreads to all items under the roof. If even a small part of a corpse is under a balcony, everyone who passes under that balcony is rendered impure. Many people come to Jerusalem to sacrifice offerings, and they must maintain a state of ritual purity. The other reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that those </span>great crowds of <span class="gemarra-regular">pilgrims not be injured </span>by colliding with the projections.
The next <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to Jerusalem is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not establish garbage dumps in it. </span>The Gemara explains that the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">repugnant creatures </span>that are attracted to such heaps and impart ritual impurity upon their death.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not build kilns in </span>Jerusalem. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span>unsightly <span class="gemarra-regular">smoke </span>produced by kilns. The Sages sought to preserve the beauty of Jerusalem and the Temple.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not plant gardens and orchards in it. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the odor </span>emitted by these places, either from discarded weeds or from fertilizer.
The next <span class="it-text">halakha</span> on the list is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not raise chickens in </span>Jerusalem. The Gemara explains that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sacrificial </span>meat that is consumed in Jerusalem. Since chickens peck in the garbage, they are likely to pick up items that impart ritual impurity and bring them into contact with the consecrated food, which may not be eaten in an impure state.
The Gemara discusses the last <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not leave a corpse overnight in it. </span>The Gemara notes that this prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> there is no known explanation for it.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not raise pig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anywhere. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the background for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the members of <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of Hasmonean</span> monarchy <span class="gemarra-regular">were at war with each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hyrcanus, </span>one of the parties to this war, <span class="gemarra-regular">was inside </span>the besieged Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>his brother <span class="gemarra-regular">Aristobulus, </span>the other contender to the throne, was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside. And every day </span>the people inside <span class="gemarra-regular">would lower down money in a box </span>from the Temple walls, to purchase sheep to sacrifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>those on other side <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>take the money and <span class="gemarra-regular">send up </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>over the wall for the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily offerings.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There was a certain elder there who was familiar with Greek wisdom, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>to those besieging Jerusalem: <span class="gemarra-regular">As long as they occupy themselves with the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, they will not be delivered into your hands. The next day they lowered down money in a box </span>as usual, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>this time <span class="gemarra-regular">they sent up to them a pig. When the pig reached to the midpoint of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">wall it stuck its hooves into the wall, and Eretz Yisrael quaked </span>over an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">At that time </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Cursed be the man who raises pigs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cursed be the man who teaches his son Greek wisdom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning that time </span>of siege that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>in which the barley for the <span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came from the gardens of Tzerifin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> far from Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wheat for <span class="gemarra-regular">the two loaves </span>of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span> was brought <span class="gemarra-regular">from the valley of Ein Sokher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Barley and wheat could not be brought from any nearer because the besiegers had destroyed all the produce around Jerusalem. This concludes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>it really <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to study <span class="gemarra-regular">Greek wisdom? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: In Eretz Yisrael, </span>

Daf 83a

<span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>would one speak the <span class="gemarra-regular">Syriac [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sursi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> language? </span>One should speak <span class="gemarra-regular">either the sacred tongue, </span>Hebrew, <span class="gemarra-regular">or the Greek language</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yosei said </span>similarly: In <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia, why </span>would one speak the <span class="gemarra-regular">Aramaic language? </span>One should speak <span class="gemarra-regular">either the sacred tongue or the Persian language</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> At any rate, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement indicates that there is nothing wrong with learning and speaking Greek. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Greek language </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">discrete, and Greek wisdom </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">discrete. </span>In other words, these are two separate issues; only Greek wisdom is prohibited, not the Greek language.
The Gemara further pursues this line of inquiry: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is Greek wisdom </span>itself actually <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: </span>It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“My eye affected my soul, because of all the daughters of my city” </span>(Lamentations 3:51). Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel applied this verse to a personal tragedy: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were a thousand children in the household of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span>Rabban Gamliel; <span class="gemarra-regular">five hundred of them studied </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah, and five hundred of them studied Greek wisdom. </span>All of them were killed by the Romans; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the only </span>ones that <span class="gemarra-regular">remain of them </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">I, </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">here, and the son of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s brother, </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">in Asia Minor</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[Asya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span>. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement indicates that it is permitted to study Greek wisdom.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The household of Rabban Gamliel is different, as they </span>held <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>ties <span class="gemarra-regular">with the government. </span>Since knowledge of Greek wisdom was crucial for the members of this family, the Sages exempted them from the general decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts his hair </span>in the fashion of <span class="gemarra-italic">komi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a certain haircut favored by the Romans, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered one <span class="gemarra-regular">of the ways of the Amorites</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a gentile practice prohibited by the Torah (Leviticus 18:3). Despite this, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted Avtolmos bar Reuve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to cut his hair </span>in the fashion of <span class="gemarra-italic">komi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>ties <span class="gemarra-regular">with the government</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Like-wise, <span class="gemarra-regular">they permitted </span>the members <span class="gemarra-regular">of the household of Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to discuss </span>matters <span class="gemarra-regular">of Greek wisdom, because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>ties <span class="gemarra-regular">with the government.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with chains. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with a chain. But he may raise </span>a dog <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city that is close to the borde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the country, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">tie it during the day but may release it at night.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: One who raises dogs is like one who raises pigs. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">significance </span>of this statement? Since both are prohibited, what is the point of this comparison? The Gemara answers: The significance is with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to determining when one is liable </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">curse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it. </span>Rabbi Eliezer is saying that the same curse meted out to one who raises pigs also applies to one who raises dogs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: Babylonia is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a city close to the border, </span>and therefore it is permitted to raise dogs there. The Gemara qualifies this statement, and in this context, Babylonia is <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>as referring only to <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a city that was close to the border.
With regard to raising dogs, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai from Biri expounded: </span>It is written in connection to the Ark of the Covenant: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And when it rested, he said: Return, O Lord, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel” </span>(Numbers 10:36). This verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that the Divine Presence does not rest upon the Jewish people </span>if they number <span class="gemarra-regular">fewer than two thousand and two myriads</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where one myriad is equal to ten thousand. The plural form of “myriads” and “thousands” indicates at least two of each. If they are <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking one </span>individual from this total, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there was a pregnant woman among them, who was fit to complete </span>the number by giving birth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a dog barked at her and she miscarried </span>as a result of the fright, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>owner of the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">is found </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">caused the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people.</span>
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who entered a certain building to bake. A dog barked at her. Its owner said to her: Do not be afraid of it; its canine teet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been removed. She said to him: </span>It is too late for your reassurances. <span class="gemarra-regular">Take your favors and throw them on the thorns! </span>I have felt that <span class="gemarra-regular">the baby has already moved </span>from its place in the womb and will not be born alive.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may spread out traps for pigeons only </span>if this was performed at a distance of at least thirty <span class="it-text">ris</span>, which is eight thousand cubits, from any settled area, to ensure that privately owned pigeons are not caught in the traps. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do </span>pigeons really <span class="gemarra-regular">travel that </span>far from their established places? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 23a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One must distance a dovecot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fifty cubits from the city, </span>so that the pigeons that settle in the cotes do not eat the crops that grow in the gardens of the city. This shows that the range of a pigeon is only fifty cubits, whereas four <span class="it-text">mil</span> is eight thousand cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Pigeons <span class="gemarra-regular">fl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> much <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than fifty cubits away from their cotes, but <span class="gemarra-regular">their stomachs become full </span>from the food they find <span class="gemarra-regular">within fifty cubits, </span>and therefore they do not eat any more beyond that range.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">flying, </span>is their range only <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ris</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and no more? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In a settled area, one may not spread out </span>a trap for pigeons <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>at a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span> from the settlement? This indicates that a privately owned pigeon might be trapped even one hundred <span class="it-text">mil</span> away from a settled area. Why, then, does the mishna permit trapping beyond four <span class="it-text">mil</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not talking about an ordinary city but <span class="gemarra-regular">about a settled area </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">vineyards </span>are grown. Since the pigeons rest in the vineyards as they travel, they are able to traverse great distances. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba stated </span>a different answer: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a settled area </span>where there are many <span class="gemarra-regular">dovecote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in which they can rest from their flight.
The Gemara asks: If there are many dovecotes along the way, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the prohibition against setting pigeon traps <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the dovecotes themselves. </span>Since the mishna teaches that it is prohibited to trap pigeons within four <span class="it-text">mil</span> of privately owned dovecotes, it should be irrelevant that there is a city one hundred <span class="it-text">mil</span> away. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with dovecotes <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the prohibition against trapping pigeons from private dovecotes applies only to birds owned by Jews. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or if you wish, say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>abandoned dovecotes <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless. Or if you wish, say </span>that it is referring to dovecotes <span class="gemarra-regular">that are his, </span>i.e., they belong to the same individual who is setting the pigeon trap.


Daf 83b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for that </span>injury <span class="gemarra-regular">due to five types </span>of indemnity: He must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage, for pain, for medical costs, for loss of livelihood, and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for damag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> assessed? If <span class="gemarra-regular">one blinded </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">eye, severed his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand, broke his leg, </span>or caused any other injury, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a slave </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">sold in the </span>slave <span class="gemarra-regular">market, and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises how much he was worth </span>before the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">and how much he is wort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> after the injury. The difference between these two sums is the amount that one must pay for causing damage.
How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> assessed? If <span class="gemarra-regular">one burned </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with a skewer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beshapud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or with </span>a hot <span class="gemarra-regular">nail, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one burned another <span class="gemarra-regular">on his fingernail, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where he does not cause a bruise </span>that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates how much </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a similar </span>threshold for pain <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is willing to take </span>in order to be made <span class="gemarra-regular">to suffer in this way. </span>The one who burned the victim must then pay this amount. 
How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical cost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> assessed? If one <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>another, then he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to heal him </span>by paying for his medical costs. In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">growths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., blisters or rashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared on </span>the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the growths are <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the blow, </span>the one who struck him is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable; </span>if the growths are <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to the blow, </span>the one who struck him is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>In a case where the wound <span class="gemarra-regular">healed, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">reopened, </span>and again <span class="gemarra-regular">healed, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">reopened, </span>the one who struck him remains <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to heal </span>the injured party by paying for his medical costs, as it is apparent that the current wound resulted from the original injury. If the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">healed fully, </span>the one who struck him <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable to heal him </span>by paying for any subsequent medical costs.
How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> assessed? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a watchman of cucumbers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the one who caused him injury must compensate him based on that pay scale for the income that he lost during his convalescence. This indemnity does not take into account the value of the standard wages of the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">already gave him compensation for his hand or compensation for his leg, </span>and that compensation took into account his professional skills.
How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> assessed? <span class="gemarra-regular">It all depends on </span>the stature of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who humiliates </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who is humiliated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does the mishna take for granted the fact that one who caused injury is liable to pay compensation to the injured party? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“An eye for an eye” </span>(Exodus 21:24). You might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this means that the one who caused injury shall lose <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual eye </span>rather than pay money.
The Gemara responds: That interpretation should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind. </span>The principle implicit in the mishna is derived from a verbal analogy in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Based on the verse: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot” (Exodus 21:24), one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded the eye of </span>another, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">blinds his eye </span>as punishment; or if one <span class="gemarra-regular">severed the hand of </span>another, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">severs his hand; </span>or if one <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the leg of </span>another, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks his leg. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “One who strikes a person,” </span>and the verse also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And one who strikes an animal,” </span>to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as one who strikes an animal </span>is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation, so too, one who strikes a person </span>is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is your wish to sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that there is an objection to this derivation, there is an alternative derivation: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, </span>for he shall die” (Numbers 35:31). This indicates that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">for the life of a murderer </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall not take ransom; but you </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">take ransom for </span>one who severed another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">extremities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is analogous to the death of a limb, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>severed limbs <span class="gemarra-regular">do not regenerate. </span>
The Gemara asks: To <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>verse is the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> referring when it quotes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes </span>a person” and: “One who strikes an animal”? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes an animal shall pay its compensation, and one who strikes a person shall be put to death” </span>(Leviticus 24:21), this cannot be, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written with regard to killing, </span>not injury, and there is no monetary compensation for killing. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> references the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation, a life for a life” </span>(Leviticus 24:18); <span class="gemarra-regular">and juxtaposed to that</span> is the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if a man maims his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him” </span>(Leviticus 24:19). The Gemara challenges: But <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>latter verse <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>use the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes,” </span>which is the basis for the comparison in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are stating </span>an analogy from <span class="gemarra-regular">striking </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">striking </span>that is based not upon the exact phrasing of the verse but upon the details of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">striking that is stated with regard to an animal </span>renders one liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation, so too, </span>the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">striking that is stated with regard to a person </span>renders one liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written </span>in the verses discussing one who injures another: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And a man who strikes any person mortally shall be put to death” </span>(Leviticus 24:17), which presumably means that in the case of one who severs another’s extremity the same injury, i.e., death of a limb, is done to the one who caused the injury, and he does not pay monetary compensation? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that his limb shall be put to death, i.e., removed, but rather, that he should pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">with money. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the verse is referring to paying compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">with money? </span>Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he is punished <span class="gemarra-regular">with actual death </span>i.e., loss of a limb?
The Gemara answers: That interpretation should <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter your mind </span>for two reasons. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>reason is that this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is juxtaposed to </span>the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation”</span> (Leviticus 24:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, it is written after it: </span>“A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; <span class="gemarra-regular">as he has given a blemish to a person, so shall it be given unto him” </span>(Leviticus 24:20); <span class="gemarra-regular">and learn from </span>the use of the word “given” that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">money.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>potential difficulty with the first derivation did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer to when it prefaced its second derivation with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is your wish to say? </span>The Gemara explains: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that <span class="gemarra-regular">a further difficulty </span>was troubling <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What did you see that </span>led <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the principle of monetary payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“one who strikes an animal”? </span>Why not <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes a person </span>shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), and learn that causing an injury renders one liable to receive physical retribution, which is analogous to death, and not monetary payment? 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: The <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">damages are derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">damages are not derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>The Gemara questions this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>why not say that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person are derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person are not derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">animals?</span>
To deflect this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the second derivation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If it is your wish to say </span>that there is an objection to this derivation, there is an alternative derivation, as the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, for he shall die” </span>(Numbers 35:31). This indicates that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">for the life of a murderer </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall not take ransom; but you </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">take ransom for </span>one who severed another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">extremities, </span>which is analogous to the death of a limb, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>severed limbs <span class="gemarra-regular">do not regenerate.</span>
The Gemara challenges this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer,” coming to exclude </span>the case of one who severs another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">extremities </span>from the prohibition against taking ransom? Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">which the Merciful One states: You shall not mete out two </span>punishments <span class="gemarra-regular">to him; </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take money from him </span>as ransom <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">kill him? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the verse: “Then it shall be, if the guilty deserves to be lashed, that the judge shall lie him down and flog him before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the measure of his evildoing” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:2). From the fact that “evildoing” is singular, the Gemara homiletically infers: For <span class="gemarra-regular">one evildoing, you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">two evildoings, </span>i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act. 
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the verse: “You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, for one who is guilty of death” <span class="gemarra-regular">is still necessary </span>to teach the primary <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught in that verse, in <span class="gemarra-regular">which the Merciful One states: You shall not take money and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>the guilty from being put to death. The verse does not serve to exclude liability to pay damages from the prohibition against paying restitution. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>i.e., if the Torah desires to teach only that the court cannot take ransom to spare the murderer from being put to death, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not take ransom” </span>and follow it immediately with the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“for one who is guilty of death.” Why do I </span>need the Torah to also state: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For the life of a murderer”? Learn from </span>the addition of that phrase that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">for a murderer </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">not take ransom; but you </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">take ransom for </span>one who severed another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">extremities, which do not regenerate </span>once severed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And once it is written: “You shall not take ransom,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the first derivation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which juxtaposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes </span>a person” to: <span class="gemarra-regular">“One who strikes </span>an animal”? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> were to be derived only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>verse which states: “You shall not take ransom” (Numbers 35:31), <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say: If </span>the one who caused the damage <span class="gemarra-regular">desires</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>may choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">give his eye, and if he desires, he </span>may choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of his eye. </span>Therefore, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>to derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal: Just as one who strikes an animal </span>is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation </span>and does not receive corporal punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, one who strikes a person </span>is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pay monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation </span>and does not receive corporal punishment.
§ The Gemara presents a series of derivations for the principle that one who injures another is liable to pay monetary compensation. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai ben Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“An eye for an eye” </span>(Leviticus 24:20), means <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that he must pay the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution, or is it only </span>teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual eye? You say: </span>There may be a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the eye of </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is large and the eye of </span>the injured party is <span class="gemarra-regular">small. How can I read </span>and literally apply the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“an eye for an eye” in this </span>case? 
The Gemara continues the derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in all cases like this, </span>where their eyes are different sizes, the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">takes monetary restitution </span>from the one who caused him injury, but in a case where their eyes are the same size, the one who caused injury is punished by actually having his eye removed, this cannot be, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah said: “You shall have one manner of law” </span>(Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">law </span>shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">equal for all of you. </span>
The Sages object to this derivation and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty </span>in saying that his eye should be blinded? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps, </span>as the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the injured party’s eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>that the court should <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sight from </span>his eye as well, no matter the size of the eye. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since, if you do not say so, </span>then by the same logic, 

Daf 84a

in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who killed a large </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a large </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who killed a small </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">how do we kill </span>the murderer? If one suggests that in such a case a monetary penalty will be imposed, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law” </span>(Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <span class="gemarra-regular">law </span>shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">equal for all of you, </span>so the punishment must be the same for all murderers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>explain that since the murderer <span class="gemarra-regular">took the life of </span>the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states that </span>the court should likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">take the life from him. So too, </span>since the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sight from </span>the eye of the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>that the court should likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sight from </span>his eye. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, in accordance with the objection of the Sages.
The Gemara presents another derivation: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “An eye for an eye” </span>(Leviticus 24:20), is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that this is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution, or is it only </span>teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual eye? </span>There may be a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a blind person and he blinded </span>another, or there was <span class="gemarra-regular">one with a severed limb and he severed </span>the limb of another, or there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a lame person and he caused </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lame. In this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can I fulfill “an eye for an eye” </span>literally, when he is already lacking the limb that must be injured? If one will suggest that in that case, a monetary penalty will be imposed, that can be refuted: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law” </span>(Leviticus 24:22), which teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law </span>shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">equal for all of you.</span>
The Sages object to this derivation and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: And what </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty? Perhaps </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is possible </span>to render the guilty party liable according to the punishment listed in the Torah, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>and the court does so; but in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is not possible </span>to enact such a punishment, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not possible, and we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt him. As if you do not say so, </span>that punishing one and exempting another is not counter to the principle of: “One manner of law,” then by the same logic, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has a wound that will cause him to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">who killed a healthy person, what do we do to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is possible </span>to render the guilty party liable according to the punishment listed in the Torah, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>and the court does so; but in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is not possible </span>to do so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not possible, and we exempt him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, in accordance with the objection of the Sages.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; as he has given a blemish to a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so shall it be given unto him” </span>(Leviticus 24:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">and giving can </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> to a payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">money. </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, </span>then when the same verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As he has given </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a blemish to a person,” </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>word, “<span class="it-text">yitten</span>,” <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to money? </span>The word “<span class="it-text">yitten</span>” means that he caused an actual injury, even though it employs a term whose literal meaning is give.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: The rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yishmael are interpreting a superfluous verse. Now, it is written: “And if a man gives a blemish to his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him” </span>(Leviticus 24:19), so <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall it be given unto him” </span>(Leviticus 24:20)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the repetition that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution. </span>The Gemara asks: But if this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> given </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a blemish to a person” </span>(Leviticus 24:20)? What does the usage of the term “<span class="it-text">yitten</span>” teach? The Gemara answers: In fact, it does not teach anything, but rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the Merciful One <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to write </span>at the end of that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So shall it be given unto him,” </span>where the employment of a term of giving is accurate, the Merciful One <span class="gemarra-regular">also wrote </span>earlier in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As he has given </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a blemish to a person.”</span>
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to conspiring witnesses: “And your eye shall not pity; a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, <span class="gemarra-regular">a hand for a hand, </span>a foot for a foot” (Deuteronomy 19:21). This teaches that the witnesses pay compensation with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is given from hand to hand. And what </span>type of compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">is that? Monetary restitution. </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is so, is </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A foot for a foot” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:21), <span class="gemarra-regular">also like that, </span>i.e., is it teaching that the witnesses pay compensation with an item passed from foot to foot? 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The rabbis of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya are interpreting a superfluous </span>phrase in the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse. Now, it is written: “And you shall do to him as he purposed to do to his brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">If it enters your mind </span>to say that the verse means this <span class="gemarra-regular">literally, why do I </span>need the Torah to specify: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A hand for a hand” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:21)? The punishment will be whatever he purported to do to his brother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the extra phrase that the punishment is <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A foot for a foot” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:21)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is written: “A hand for a hand,” </span>the Merciful One <span class="gemarra-regular">also wrote </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A foot for a foot.”</span>
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says </span>that this principle is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Ḥizkiyya, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught </span>that the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“An eye for an eye” </span>(Exodus 21:24), and: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A life for a life” </span>(Exodus 21:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">but not an eye and a life for an eye. And if it enters your mind </span>to say that the verse means this <span class="gemarra-regular">literally, </span>there could be <span class="gemarra-regular">times when you find </span>a case where both <span class="gemarra-regular">an eye and a life </span>are taken <span class="gemarra-regular">for an eye, </span>i.e., when the one who caused the damage is so weak <span class="gemarra-regular">that as </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">blinds </span>his eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">his soul departs </span>from his body.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty? Perhaps we evaluate </span>the physical condition <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the guilty party; <span class="gemarra-regular">if he can withstand </span>this punishment, then <span class="gemarra-regular">we do </span>blind his eye; <span class="gemarra-regular">if he cannot withstand </span>this punishment, then <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not </span>do so and he goes unpunished. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if we evaluate </span>him and determine <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can withstand </span>this punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do so to him </span>and blind his eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">his soul departs </span>his body as a result, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he dies, he will die. Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to lashes </span>(<span class="it-text">Makkot</span> 22b): If one was sentenced to be flogged, and the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluated him </span>and determined that he could withstand a certain number of lashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he dies at the han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> of the officer tasked with administering the lashes, then the officer is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>even though the one who was flogged was not sentenced to the death penalty? Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Abaye. 
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rabba </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “A wound for a wound” </span>(Exodus 21:25), to teach that one who injures another must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case </span>where he pays compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And if it enters your mind </span>that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), refers to the removal of <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual </span>eye from the one who injured the other, then <span class="gemarra-regular">just as</span> it is so that the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">has pain </span>from the loss of his eye, the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">also has pain </span>when the court removes his eye; why then does the Torah require that he pay compensation for pain as well?
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty? Perhaps there is a person who is delicate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so <span class="gemarra-regular">he has more pain, and there is a person who is not delicate, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have </span>the same amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">pain. </span>Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for pain. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>when the Torah states: “A wound for a wound” (Exodus 21:25)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>the injured party compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the difference between </span>them in pain tolerance. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rav Zevid. 
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava </span>that concerning one who was injured by another, who must pay for damage, the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“If he rises again, and walks outside upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be absolved; only he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” </span>(Exodus 21:19), which teaches that one who injures another must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in a case </span>where he pays compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. And if it enters your mind </span>that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), is referring to an <span class="gemarra-regular">actual </span>eye, then <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">needs healing, </span>the one who caused him the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">also needs healing </span>after the court removes his eye; why, then, does the Torah require that he pay compensation for medical costs as well?
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty? Perhaps there is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">whose flesh heals quickly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">whose flesh does not heal quickly. </span>Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for medical costs. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>when the Torah states: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>the injured party compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the difference between </span>their respective medical costs.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that the fact that one who injures another pays monetary restitution <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>from a verbal analogy of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for,” </span>as written with regard to injuries caused to people <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for,” </span>as written with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that gored another ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written here: “An eye for an eye” </span>(Exodus 21:24), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written there, </span>with regard to a forewarned ox that gored the ox of another: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall pay an ox for an ox” </span>(Exodus 21:36). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the verse does not mean that the owner pays compensation with an actual ox, but rather pays <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution, so too here, </span>one who injures another pays <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did you see that </span>led <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from a verbal analogy of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for” </span>as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for” </span>as stated with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox? Let us learn </span>a verbal analogy of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for” </span>as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“for” </span>as stated with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, as it is written </span>about one who kills another: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall give a life for a life” </span>(Exodus 21:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the court punishes the guilty party by taking his <span class="gemarra-regular">actual </span>life, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>why not say that the court should take his <span class="gemarra-regular">actual </span>eye?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages is derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages is not derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is not derived from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">animals.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi </span>retracted his original statement and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>a different derivation: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>a verbal analogy of the word “for” as written with regard to injuries from the word “for” as written with regard to a man who rapes a woman, who must pay monetary compensation. The verse states: “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">for he has afflicted her; </span>he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Based on this verbal analogy, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a verse concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">damages. </span>
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“An eye for an eye” </span>(Exodus 21:24), is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual</span> eye. The Gemara asks: Can it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual </span>eye? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer </span>understand the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">like all these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who explained that this verse is referring to monetary payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>in response: Rabbi Eliezer means <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as a slave </span>to assess the compensation for the injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, like whom </span>does the court appraise the injured party? If you say that the court appraises him <span class="gemarra-regular">like a freeman, does a freeman have monetary </span>value? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: </span>Rabbi Eliezer means <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not appraise the injured </span>party as if he were going to be sold as a slave, but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>they appraise <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who caused </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The court appraises how much the latter’s value would be reduced were he to sustain the same injury he caused to the injured party, and he pays this amount as indemnity.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain donkey that severed the hand of a child</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Pappa bar Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said </span>to the officers of the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go appraise the four types </span>of indemnity <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the child. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in the mishna that there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>types of indemnity? Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was saying </span>to include the indemnities the responsible party is liable to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">other than damage. Abaye said to him: But </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that caused this injury, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that causes injury <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">damage?</span> Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the officers of the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go appraise for </span>the child the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">his damage. </span>They said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>doesn’t the child <span class="gemarra-regular">need to be appraised as a slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said to them: Go appraise him as a slave. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The father of the child said to them: I do not want </span>my child to be appraised as a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">because this matter </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">demean him. They said to </span>the father: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>you are <span class="gemarra-regular">acting to the detriment of the child, </span>as he will not receive compensation for his injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: When he matures, I will appease him with my own </span>money, rather than see him demeaned now. 
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain ox that chewed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">da’alas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the hand of a child, </span>injuring him. The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. He said to </span>the officers of the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go appraise him as a slave. They said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it </span>you, <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, who said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is appraised as a slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in order to determine the amount of a monetary penalty, that penalty <span class="gemarra-regular">is not collected </span>by courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia? </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary </span>to appraise his value in order to force the guilty party to pay restitution, but it is nevertheless necessary to determine his value. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">seize</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> property from the one who caused him injury, and that property is equal in value to what the payment should be, the court will not compel him to return it. 
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava says: </span>Compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by an ox and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a person is collected </span>by courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia, </span>but compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a person and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by an ox is not collected </span>by courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia. </span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by a person and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by an ox, </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>collected in Babylonia? If you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require ordained judges </span>to collect damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there are not </span>any ordained judges in Babylonia, then <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox to an ox, and </span>damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to an ox, </span>

Daf 84b

say that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require ordained judges [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">elohim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and there are no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> any ordained judges in Babylonia.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is different </span>about damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by an ox and </span>damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a man, </span>so that Babylonian judges can rule in these cases even though they are not ordained? The difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we, </span>the judges of Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">perform the agenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">admissions and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as we are permitted to rule in those cases as agents of the ordained judges in Eretz Yisrael. If so, then in cases of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by a perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>cases of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by an ox as well, </span>why not say that the judges of Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">admissions and loans?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state, </span>with regard to the distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we, </span>the judges of Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so <span class="gemarra-regular">in matters where </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is clear to us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">in matters where </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is not clear to us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as in the case of an injury to a person, which requires an appraisal, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>an objection: In cases of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox by an ox, and </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox by a man, </span>cases that we do judge in Babylonia, the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is also not clear to us, </span>as the damage must be appraised. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>how is the judgment assessed in those cases? We say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see how </span>much <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox is sold </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">in the marketplace, </span>and thereby assess the value of the damages, without a detailed appraisal. If so, in the case of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by a person, and </span>damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by an ox, </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">too: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see how a slave is sold in the </span>slave <span class="gemarra-regular">market. </span>Why, then, are these latter cases not judged in Babylonia?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">payment of double </span>the principal incurred by a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment </span>incurred by a thief who stole a sheep or ox and then slaughtered or sold the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the payments <span class="gemarra-regular">are fixed </span>and there is no need for an appraisal, <span class="gemarra-regular">we should perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state, </span>with regard to the distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases where the guilty party pays <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution </span>for a loss he caused. But <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a penalty, </span>such as the double, fourfold, or fivefold payments of a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not perfor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael. 
The Gemara asks: In cases of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by a person, where </span>the liable party pays <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should we perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <span class="gemarra-regular">in cases that are common. </span>Therefore, in cases of damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by a person, </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">that are uncommon, we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara challenges: But accordingly, for indemnities paid to a woman for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation and degradatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> after being raped or seduced, a case <span class="gemarra-regular">that is common</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we should perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, </span>we do collect compensation for humiliation and degradation in Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Pappa collected four hundred dinars </span>as compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for humiliation </span>when he judged these cases. The Gemara questions this explanation: But the other Sages do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>agree <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>that ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa, as Rav Ḥisda sent </span>this question <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman, </span>asking if he should collect compensation for humiliation and degradation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him </span>the following reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda, Ḥisda, do you collect a penalty in Babylonia?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>explain the distinction this way: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <span class="gemarra-regular">in a matter that is common and involves, </span>i.e., the payment is for, <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary loss. But in a matter that is common but does not involve a monetary loss, or in an uncommon matter which does involve a monetary loss, we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>in a case of an injury caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person, even though it involves a monetary loss, since it is uncommon, we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael. In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, even though it is common, since it does not involve a monetary loss, we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara challenges the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it in fact the case that the courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia collect </span>restitution for damage caused to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox by an ox? But doesn’t Rava say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox caused damage, </span>the courts <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia do not collect </span>the compensation. The Gemara clarifies: To <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>did the ox cause <span class="gemarra-regular">damage? If we say that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged a person, why </span>did Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>state his <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that damaged a person? Even </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who damaged a person, </span>which is more common, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not collect </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia. Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that Rava meant that the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">damaged an ox. And </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not collect </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia. </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Rava stated his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an innocuous </span>ox, i.e., an ox that was not forewarned, whose owner pays for the damage as a penalty; and penalties are not collected in Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>Rava states his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a forewarned </span>ox, and payment for damage it causes is not a penalty, but rather serves as compensation. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rava say: There are no forewarned </span>oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia, </span>as an ox can be forewarned only by ordained judges? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>an ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was forewarned there, </span>in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then its owners <span class="gemarra-regular">brought it here, </span>to Babylonia. 
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But this is an uncommon matter, </span>as forewarned oxen are not frequently transported from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon matter, did you not say that we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the Rabbis from there, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, who are ordained, <span class="gemarra-regular">came and declared </span>this ox <span class="gemarra-regular">forewarned, here, </span>i.e., in Babylonia. The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon matter, and you say </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon matter </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not perform the agency of </span>the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rava says </span>that courts in Babylonia collect restitution for damage caused by an ox, he means <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>damage in the categories of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eating and Trampling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which are forewarned from the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> All agree that since these are common forms of damage and involve monetary loss, the judges of Babylonia perform the agency of the judges of Eretz Yisrael and collect compensation for the damage.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the mishna, which states: How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>assessed? If <span class="gemarra-regular">one burned </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with a skewer or with a </span>hot <span class="gemarra-regular">nail, </span>or even if he burned him on his fingernail, where he would not cause a bruise that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court evaluates how much money a person with a similar threshold for pain as the victim is willing to take in order to be made to suffer in this way. The Gemara comments: This teaches that even when the <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>to the injured party, the one who caused the injury must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>compensation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the verse: “<span class="it-text">Keviyya</span> for <span class="it-text">keviyya</span>, a wound for a wound, <span class="it-text">ḥabura</span> for <span class="it-text">ḥabura</span>” (Exodus 21:25), <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A burn [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is the first </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the verse, and <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai says: A bruise [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is the first </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the verse. 
The Gemara explains the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Ben Azzai certainly agrees that the first term in the verse, “<span class="it-text">keviyya</span>,” means a burn. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” indicates </span>an injury <span class="gemarra-regular">with no bruise, </span>and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another even in that manner; therefore, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to reveal about </span>the meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">of “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>that if the burn also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a bruise, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain; but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the burn has <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>bruise, then <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the one who caused the injury does not pay compensation for pain alone. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And ben Azzai holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” indicates </span>a burn <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a bruise, </span>and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another only in that manner; therefore, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to reveal about </span>the meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">of “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>that even if it is a burn <span class="gemarra-regular">with no bruise, </span>the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain alone, even though there is no damage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to </span>Rava’s explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, the opposite stands to reason, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A burn [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is the first </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the verse, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” indicates </span>a burn <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a bruise, </span>and one would be liable to pay for injuring another only in that manner. Therefore, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to reveal about </span>the meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">of “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>that even if it is a burn <span class="gemarra-regular">with no bruise, </span>the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain alone, even though there is no damage. 
Rav Pappa continues: And <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bruise [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is the first </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the verse, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” indicates </span>an injury <span class="gemarra-regular">with no bruise, </span>and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another even in that manner. Therefore, when <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥabura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to reveal about </span>the meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">of “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>that if the burn also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a bruise, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain; but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the burn has <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>bruise, then <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the one who caused the injury does not pay compensation for pain alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to this explanation, the statements of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai with regard to the meaning of the terms in the verse are <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">final understanding </span>of the verse. The term: The first term stated, is referring to the understanding of the first term after the second term has been written, not what the understanding of the first term would have been if not for the addition of the second term. According to the explanation of Rav Pappa, the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara offers another explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, everyone </span>agrees is that <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keviyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” indicates </span>an injury <span class="gemarra-regular">whether there is a bruise or whether there is not a bruise. And here,</span>

Daf 85a

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>over whether the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail is applied <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a generalization and a detail that are distant from each other.</span> When a generalization is followed by a detail, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only in the case specified in the detail. The verse states: “<span class="it-text">Keviyya</span> for <span class="it-text">keviyya</span>, a wound for a wound, <span class="it-text">ḥabura</span> for <span class="it-text">ḥabura</span>” (Exodus 21:25). The word “<span class="it-text">keviyya</span>,” as stated in the beginning of the verse, is a generalization that includes burns not accompanied by bruises as well as burns accompanied by bruises. “<span class="it-text">Ḥabura</span>,” as stated at the end of the verse, is a detail of a burn that is accompanied by a bruise. The Torah distances the detail, “<span class="it-text">ḥabura</span>,” from the generalization, “<span class="it-text">keviyya</span>,” by stating the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: “A wound for a wound” between them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that since there is an intervening phrase between the generalization and the detail, one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the verse concerning burns and bruises by <span class="gemarra-regular">employing </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a detail. </span>Therefore, the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation for pain in all cases of burns, even those that are not accompanied by bruises. <span class="gemarra-regular">And ben Azzai holds </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">does derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the verse concerning burns and bruises by <span class="gemarra-regular">employing </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization and a detail, </span>and therefore the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation for pain only if the burn is accompanied by a bruise. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the Torah to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabura</span> for <span class="it-text">ḥabura</span>,” as that is included as a subset of “<span class="it-text">keviyya</span>”? The phrase mentioning “<span class="it-text">ḥabura</span>” is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">additional money, </span>i.e., in a case where someone caused a burn with a bruise, he pays additional compensation for the bruise beyond that for the burn.
§ The mishna teaches: How is the payment for pain assessed? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates how much </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a similar </span>threshold for pain <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is willing to take </span>in order to be made to suffer in this way. The one who burned the victim must then pay this amount. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How do we appraise pain in a case </span>where the injured party also suffered personal <span class="gemarra-regular">injury? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s father says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates how much </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is willing to take </span>to allow someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to sever his hand. </span>The Gemara objects: Do you really mean <span class="gemarra-regular">to sever his hand? </span>Wouldn’t this evaluation <span class="gemarra-regular">be not just for pain, but </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">include all five types </span>of indemnity? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, are we dealing with fools, </span>who would accept money to have their hands severed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court evaluates how much money a person would accept to allow someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to sever his</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">severed hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is of no use. The Gemara objects: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his severed hand also, there is not pain alone, but there is </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">pain and humiliation, because it is an embarrassing matter for him </span>if someone were <span class="gemarra-regular">to take </span>a part <span class="gemarra-regular">of his flesh to throw it to dogs. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates how much a person is willing to take </span>to allow someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to sever his hand, which is </span>already condemned by <span class="gemarra-regular">a written </span>decree <span class="gemarra-regular">from the government</span> to be severed, changing the decree <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>having it severed by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a drug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is not accompanied by pain, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>having it severed by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sword, </span>which is accompanied by pain. The amount of money he would accept to have his hand severed by a sword instead of by the drug is his compensation. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>one would <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">and cause himself pain </span>in this way, so there is no indemnity to evaluate. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates how much a person would giv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>have someone <span class="gemarra-regular">sever his hand, which is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">condemned </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">a written </span>decree <span class="gemarra-regular">from the government </span>to be severed, changing the decree <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>having it be severed by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sword, </span>which is accompanied by pain, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>having it be severed by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a drug, </span>which is not accompanied by pain. 
The Gemara objects: If this is the case, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>wording of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">To take, </span>is imprecise; <span class="gemarra-regular">it should have </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">To give. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>The mishna means that the court evaluates how much <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">will take from that </span>one, i.e., the one who caused the injury, based on <span class="gemarra-regular">what this </span>man, the injured party, would have <span class="gemarra-regular">given </span>to the government to have his hand severed by a drug rather than with a sword.
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs </span>assessed? If one <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>another, then he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to heal him </span>by paying for his medical costs. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:4): If <span class="gemarra-regular">growths appeare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the injured area <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the injury, and the wound reopened, </span>then the one who caused the injury is again <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to heal him </span>by covering his medical costs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and is liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood </span>while he recovers from the reopened wound. But if the growths that appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">are not due to the injury, he is not liable to heal him </span>by covering his medical costs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is not liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the growths appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the injury, he is liable to heal him </span>by covering his medical costs, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he is not liable to give him the </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of his loss of livelihood. And the Rabbis say: </span>The one who caused the injury is not liable at all, because the Torah states the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his medical costs </span>together. This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for loss of livelihood is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs, and </span>anyone <span class="gemarra-regular">who is not liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for loss of livelihood is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable to </span>pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? Rabba said: I found the Sages in the study hall of Rav when they were sitting and were stating </span>an explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound may be </span>wrapped in a <span class="gemarra-regular">bandage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., whether one is permitted to bandage his wound to lessen the pain, at the risk of causing damaging side effects. 
Rabba explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound may be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bandage. </span>Consequently, if the bandage causes side effects which lead the injured party to incur additional medical expenses, those expenses are considered to have resulted from the original injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound may not be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bandage. </span>Therefore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse repeated </span>the obligation to pay them, by stating: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<span class="it-text">verappo</span> <span class="it-text">yerappe</span>]” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay compensation. But for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse did not repeat </span>the obligation to pay it, the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not liable </span>to pay compensation.
Rabba continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I said to them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>Rabbi Yehuda were to hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound may not be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bandage, </span>then the one who caused the injury should <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not be liable </span>to pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs, </span>as he is not liable to compensate the injured party for damage resulting from his own irresponsible behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the disagreement is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound may be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bandage, but may not be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> excessive bandage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
He explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>a wound <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be </span>wrapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in an excessive bandage, </span>then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse repeated </span>the obligation to pay them, by stating: “<span class="it-text">Verappo</span> <span class="it-text">yerappe</span>” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay compensation. But for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood, </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">which the verse did not repeat </span>the obligation to pay, the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable </span>to pay compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold: Since the verse repeated </span>the obligation to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs, one is also liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for loss of livelihood, which is juxtaposed to </span>the obligation to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs, </span>as the verse states: “Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.” 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that even though medical costs and loss of livelihood are juxtaposed, the one who caused the injury is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable </span>to pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Merciful One restricted it </span>in the Torah, as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Only </span>he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19). “Only” is a restricting term. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>who hold that one must pay for loss of livelihood in this case as well, hold that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“only” is coming </span>to exclude growths <span class="gemarra-regular">that were not due to the injury, </span>with regard to which the one who caused the injury is exempt from liability. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter Rabbis </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: Anyone who is liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for loss of livelihood is liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs, and anyone who is not liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for loss of livelihood is not liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs, why do I </span>need, i.e., how do I account for, the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repeated </span>the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is necessary for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael says: </span>When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">verappo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 21:19), it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here that permission is granted to a doctor to heal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is not considered to be an intervention counter to the will of God.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if growths appeared due to the injury, and the wound reopened, </span>then the one who caused the injury is again <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to heal him </span>by covering his medical costs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and is liable to give him </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of his loss of livelihood </span>while he recovers from the reopened wound? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” </span>(Exodus 21:19). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the growths <span class="gemarra-regular">were not due to the injury. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Only</span> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood,” in order to exclude this case. This is in accordance with the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Even </span>if the growths appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the injury, </span>the one who caused the injury is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: “Only.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if the growths appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the injury, </span>the one who caused the injury is <span class="gemarra-regular">completely exempt </span>from paying compensation, both for medical costs and loss of livelihood. And this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter Rabbis </span>in the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if the growths appeared <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the injury, </span>the one who caused the injury is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood, but is liable </span>to pay compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for medical costs. In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father, </span>Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the growths <span class="gemarra-regular">were not due to the injury. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Only </span>he shall pay for his loss of livelihood,” to teach that he is exempt in this case. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there a need </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>to teach that he is exempt in the case of growths <span class="gemarra-regular">that were not due to the injury? </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: What </span>did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it said that the growths <span class="gemarra-regular">were not due to the injury? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who violated </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">doctor’s instruction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ate honey or any type of sweet </span>food, which the doctor had instructed him not to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>of the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that honey or any type of sweet </span>foods <span class="gemarra-regular">are detrimental to </span>the recovery from <span class="gemarra-regular">the injury</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his injury developed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">garguteni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable to heal him </span>by covering his medical costs. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Only,” </span>to teach that he is exempt in this case. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">garguteni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Abaye said: Necrosis. What is its remedy? Crystalline ice plant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wax, and wine dregs.</span>
§ The Gemara presents several <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning compensation for medical costs: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will heal yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> myself, as I am a doctor; the injured party may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You are to me as a predatory lion, </span>in that I fear you and do not trust you to heal me. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will bring a doctor who heals for no cost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that I will not need to pay for your medical costs; the injured party may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: A doctor who heals for no cost </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">worth nothing. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the injured party: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will bring you a doctor </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a distant </span>place, the injured party may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: A doctor </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distant </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">blinds the eye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A local doctor has an incentive to ensure that the patient fully heals, while a doctor from a distant place has no incentive to monitor the patient once he has received his fee. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that one, </span>the injured party, <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the one who caused him injury: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I will </span>take responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">healing myself; </span>the one who caused him the injury may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: You will be negligent with yourself and you will take more from me </span>than was originally necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the one who caused him injury: <span class="gemarra-regular">Settle a fixed </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">for me </span>to cover my medical costs, and I will take care of my own recovery; the one who caused him the injury may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: All the more so </span>with this proposal is there a concern <span class="gemarra-regular">that you will be negligent with yourself, </span>as you will wish to profit and you will not spend the money on your recovery, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will call me: An</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ox that causes damage, </span>because I caused an injury from which you did not recover.
§ With regard to compensation for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And all of these </span>types of indemnity <span class="gemarra-regular">are pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a case </span>where the one who caused injury must also pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: The verse states: “A wound for a wound” </span>(Exodus 21:25), to teach that the one who caused injury is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain in a case of damage.</span>
The Gemara asks: But isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach an additional <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: 

Daf 85b

This serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>in the category of those liable to pay compensation one who causes injury <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> just as </span>one who causes injury <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally </span>is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one who causes injury <span class="gemarra-regular">due to circumstances beyond his control just as </span>one who causes injury <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>and the verse teaches only this, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the verse write </span>the more succinct phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A wound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for a wound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">befatza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; what </span>is taught by the expanded phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A wound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a wound [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taḥat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">patza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? Conclude two </span>conclusions <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse, that the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation regardless of how he caused the injury, and that he must pay compensation for pain in addition to compensation for damage.
With regard to compensation for medical costs in a case where one pays compensation for damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “He shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">verappo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 21:19), and the doubled term teaches that the one who caused the injury is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>monetary compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs in a case of </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage. </span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary for </span>teaching a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Verappo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” from here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that permission is granted to a doctor to heal. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let the verse write: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Verofeh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning: And a doctor shall heal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the phrase employed that the one who caused the injury is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>monetary compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs in a case of damage.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">still necessary for</span> the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that we stated </span>previously, i.e., it was necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for the verse to repeat </span>the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of healing, </span>as the Gemara explained. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let the verse say </span>one of the two words twice, <span class="gemarra-regular">either: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Rappo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">rappo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yerappe</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What </span>is taught by repeating the language with a change: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Verappo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yerappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? Learn from </span>this wording that the one who caused the injury is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give </span>monetary compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs in a case of damage.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that compensation for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation are paid even where the one who caused the injury pays compensation for damage. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that you find these </span>examples of cases where the one who caused an injury must pay compensation for these indemnities <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not in a case of damage. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not in a case of damage? </span>
The Gemara answers: An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>alone is <span class="gemarra-regular">as that </span>which the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>explicitly: How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>assessed? If <span class="gemarra-regular">he burned </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with a skewe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or with a </span>hot <span class="gemarra-regular">nail, or even </span>if he burned him <span class="gemarra-regular">on his fingernail, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where he does not cause a bruise, </span>i.e., there was no personal injury, only pain, the court evaluates the monetary value of the pain. An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs </span>alone is <span class="gemarra-regular">where some </span>body part <span class="gemarra-regular">was hurting and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">came and brought him a strong drug, and it whitened his flesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">must give him </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">drug to restore the color to his flesh, </span>even though he caused no damage, i.e., loss of function.
An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>alone is a case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who locked </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">in a room [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’inderona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and forced him to be idle, </span>but did not cause him any personal injury. An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation </span>alone is a case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spit in the fac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>another, without causing any personal injury.
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>assessed? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:2): How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>assessed? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. And if you say: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">the standard of justice was compromised. </span>The Gemara interjects to clarify this statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It appears to be compromised, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when this man will recover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not collect the wage of a watchman of cucumbers, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">carry buckets and collect </span>a higher <span class="gemarra-regular">wage, or </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">travel as an agent and collect </span>an even higher <span class="gemarra-regular">wage. </span>The assessment of loss of livelihood should also account for one of these types of labor.
The Gemara returns to quoting the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The standard of justice was not compromised, because </span>the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">already gave him the value of his han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or the value of his leg, </span>and that compensation took into account the professional opportunities he lost due to the injury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">severed the hand of </span>another, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him the value of his hand </span>as compensation for damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the leg of </span>another, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him the value of his leg </span>as compensation for damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were a watchman at the opening </span>to a courtyard, because he cannot work even as a watchman of cucumbers, as that requires walking around the cucumber field. 
Rava continues: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded the eye of </span>another, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him the </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">of his eye </span>as compensation for damage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">as though </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">caused him to grind with a mill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as even a blind person can do this. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">deafened </span>another, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him his entire valu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as compensation for damage, because one lacking the ability to hear is not fit for any form of employment. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">severed the hand </span>of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluate hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to determine the compensation, and then he <span class="gemarra-regular">broke his leg, and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluate him </span>for this additional injury, and then he <span class="gemarra-regular">blinded his eye, and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluate him </span>for this further injury; <span class="gemarra-regular">and ultimately </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">deafened him, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: Since </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">did not evaluate him </span>each time, <span class="gemarra-regular">one evaluation is sufficient for </span>the court to determine his compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the one who caused him injury must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him his entire value at once, </span>as that is the compensation for deafening him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say: <span class="gemarra-regular">We evaluate </span>each injury <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one, and we </span>obligate the one who caused him injury to <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>compensation for each.
Rava explains the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">The difference is </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the one who caused the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">must give him </span>monetary compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain and humiliation for each and every one </span>of the injuries. <span class="gemarra-regular">Although he does not give him </span>monetary compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> damage, medical costs, and loss of livelihood for each and every one </span>of the injuries, <span class="gemarra-regular">since, </span>ultimately, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is giving him his entire value </span>after deafening him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is like someone who killed him, and therefore he gives him his entire value </span>and no more; <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event, </span>must he <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">pain and humiliation for each and every one </span>of the injuries, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">had pain and humiliation </span>each time?
Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>as a resolution to this dilemma that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the fact is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">had not evaluated him </span>after each injury, the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">pays him his entire value all together, </span>then there is another dilemma: If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">had evaluated him </span>after each injury but the one who caused the injury had not paid the compensation before he deafened him, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: Since </span>it is so that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluated him, </span>the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to give him </span>the compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of the injuries? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, since </span>the one who caused him injury <span class="gemarra-regular">had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>those compensations before deafening him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him his entire value. </span>The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raises a dilemma: </span>If one injured another, causing him <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood that diminishes his monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he struck him on his hand and his hand became weakened </span>so that he could not work, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">will ultimately return</span> to its original health, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Should one say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">will ultimately return </span>to its original health, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not need to give him any </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">whatsoever </span>for the damage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, in any event, he has diminished </span>his value for <span class="gemarra-regular">now.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from a mishna (87a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who strikes his father or his mothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not cause them </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">a bruise, </span>and who therefore is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, which is the penalty for one who causes his parent a bruise, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who injures another on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore is liable for excision from the World-to-Come [<span class="it-text">karet</span>] and not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, 

Daf 86a

is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the five types of indemnity.
The Gemara explains: In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of one who injured his parent but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not bruise him, what are the circumstances? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he struck him on his hand, and it will eventually return </span>to its original health? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to this case that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the five types of indemnity. If so, this resolves Rabba’s dilemma.
The Sages object and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he deafened </span>his parent by striking him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not bruise him. </span>Since his father’s hearing loss is permanent, he is liable to pay all five types of indemnity, and this is not relevant to Rabba’s dilemma. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabba </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One who deafens his fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is executed, </span>even though no bruise is visible, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is impossible for deafening </span>to occur <span class="gemarra-regular">without a bruise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is certain that <span class="gemarra-regular">a drop of blood fell into his ear </span>from the blow, even if it is not visible from the outside.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he shaved his </span>father’s hair without causing a bruise. In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he shaved him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">will return, and this is </span>an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">our dilemma, </span>i.e., of an injury to a limb that will return to its original health. If so, this resolves Rabba’s dilemma.
The Sages object and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he smeared </span>his father with a <span class="gemarra-regular">depilatory </span>agent <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nasha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that caused his hair to fall out, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">will not return. </span>
The Gemara explains how one could be liable for each of the five types of indemnity by smearing a depilatory agent: The father experiences <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has fissures on his head and has pain from those fissures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He incurs <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs because he requires healing </span>for the fissures. He incurs <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he would dance in taverns </span>to earn money, <span class="gemarra-regular">which requires </span>him to <span class="gemarra-regular">make various gestures with his head </span>and his hair while dancing; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot gesture </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">of those fissures </span>on his head. He experiences <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no humiliation greater than </span>losing one’s hair.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the matter that is a dilemma for Rabba is obvious to Abaye on this side </span>of the dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to Rava on that side </span>of the dilemma; they each resolved the dilemma but with opposing conclusions. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">on his hand and </span>the hand was <span class="gemarra-regular">weakened</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but it will ultimately return </span>to its original health, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: He gives him </span>compensation for his <span class="gemarra-regular">major loss of livelihood, </span>i.e., the decrease in his value, due to his temporary paralysis, as measured by his price on the slave market; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">minor loss of livelihood, </span>i.e., the money he would have earned while idle during his recovery. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: He gives him only the value of his loss of livelihood for each and every day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he does not give him the full value of his hand.
§ The Gemara presents another dispute between Abaye and Rava. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who severs the hand of a Hebrew slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to another, Abaye says: He gives </span>compensation for the <span class="gemarra-regular">major loss of livelihood to the slave, and </span>compensation for the <span class="gemarra-regular">minor loss of livelihood to the master. Rava says: All </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be given to the slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and land shall be purchased with </span>the money; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the master garners the profits </span>from the land for the duration of the slave’s term of slavery.
The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one injured a slave and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced </span>the slave’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he did not reduce </span>the slave’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">for his master; </span>the Gemara interjects: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where this is possible? This is possible in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he split the tip of his ear or the tip of his nostril, </span>which does not impact the slave’s ability to perform labor. The Gemara returns to continue the statement: In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the compensation goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">himself. </span>If the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced </span>the slave’s value <span class="gemarra-regular">for his master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then this is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation </span>assessed? <span class="gemarra-regular">It all depends on </span>the stature of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who humiliates </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who is humiliated. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Rather, it is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>
These opinions are <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all of those </span>cases of Jews who were humiliated, regardless of their individual stature, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property </span>and were impoverished, and their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, </span>and are all of prominent lineage. Humiliation is assessed according to a standard formula, regardless of who was humiliated. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The court views each person according to his stature, <span class="gemarra-regular">the great </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his greatness, and the small </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his smallness. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">wealthy </span>people, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">views them as though they were freeme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who lost their property; </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">poor </span>people, the court views them <span class="gemarra-regular">as the least among </span>the poor. This lessens the payment of compensation for the one who caused humiliation. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, the mishna teaches: It all depends on </span>the stature of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who humiliates </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who is humiliated, and Rabbi Meir </span>holds in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of those </span>who were humiliated <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered alike to <span class="gemarra-regular">one another. And if </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, a mishna teaches </span>(86b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who humiliates a blind person is liable, whereas Rabbi Yehuda says </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A blind person does not have humiliation. Rather, is </span>the opinion expressed in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon?</span>
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna expresses the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. When Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a blind person does not have humiliation, </span>he meant <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">taking </span>compensation for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>A blind person is not fully aware of what he does, and one can be rendered liable for causing humiliation only if he intended to humiliate the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to giving him </span>compensation for humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is given</span> compensation. 
The Gemara challenges this explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from the fact that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause </span>of that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who humiliates a sleeping person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable but a sleeping person who humiliates </span>another is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and does not teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a blind person who humiliates </span>another is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, by inference, </span>the mishna teaches that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference this </span>way, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no difference that </span>way; whether a blind person humiliates another or is humiliated, the one who causes humiliation is liable to pay compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is clear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
§ The Gemara analyzes a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in light of the three opinions cited earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sages taught: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to humiliate a small </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated a great </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">adol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives the money </span>he would have owed <span class="gemarra-regular">for the small </span>man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation to the great </span>man. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to humiliate a slave and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated a freeman, he gives the money </span>he would have owed <span class="gemarra-regular">for the slave’s humiliation to the freeman. Whose </span>opinion is this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>
The Gemara explains why this is not in accordance with the opinion of any of these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>: It <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to say that when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">small in </span>terms of his <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>i.e., he is poor; and when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gadol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">great in </span>terms of his <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>i.e., he is wealthy. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stating the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">all of those </span>who were humiliated <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">one another? And if </span>it is stating the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, doesn’t he say: Slaves have no humiliation; </span>whereas the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses the compensation owed to a slave. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is stating the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to humiliate this </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated that </span>one, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt?</span>
The Gemara explains Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for exempting one who humiliated a person whom he did not intend to humiliate? The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of humiliation is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">killing. Just as </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">killing, </span>the murderer is not executed <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he intended </span>to kill the victim specifically, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And he lies in wait for him, and rises up against him” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:11), which means he is not liable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to kill <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>specifically, so <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>the one who humiliated is not liable <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to humiliate <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>specifically, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And she put forth her hand, and took him by his genitals” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:11); this teaches that one is not liable for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to humiliate <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>specifically.
The Gemara returns to analyzing the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and when Rabbi Yehuda said: Slaves have no humiliation, </span>he meant that one would not be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to give them </span>compensation for humiliation; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the court needs <span class="gemarra-regular">to appraise </span>compensation for the humiliation of others <span class="gemarra-regular">according to their </span>humiliation, and thereby determine the compensation one owes to a freeman when he intended to humiliate a slave, then <span class="gemarra-regular">we do appraise according to their </span>humiliation. 
The Gemara presents an alternative explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. Do you maintain </span>that when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gadol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means he is <span class="gemarra-regular">great in </span>terms of his <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>and when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means he is <span class="gemarra-regular">small in </span>terms of his <span class="gemarra-regular">property? No, </span>rather, when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gadol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual adult </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">adol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; and </span>when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">an actual minor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">katan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a minor subject to humiliation? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, as Rav Pappa said </span>with regard to another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: The case involves a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached a stage in which when <span class="gemarra-regular">others humiliate him he feels humiliation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, too, </span>

Daf 86b

say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case involving a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached a stage in which when <span class="gemarra-regular">others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who humiliates a naked person, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one who humiliates a blind person, or one who humiliates a sleeping </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, but a sleeping person who humiliates </span>another is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from the roof </span>onto another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">damage and humiliated </span>him, then the one who fell is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the </span>indemnity of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>since a person is always considered forewarned, <span class="gemarra-regular">and exempt from the </span>indemnity of <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>since a person is not liable for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intend</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to humiliate the other person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:12): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another who was <span class="gemarra-regular">naked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, but </span>the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated him </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">naked is not comparable to </span>the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated him </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">clothed, </span>since one who chooses to be naked is less sensitive to humiliation. Similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bathhouse, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, but </span>the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated him in a bathhouse is not comparable to </span>the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated him in the marketplace.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another who was <span class="gemarra-regular">naked, </span>the one who humiliated him is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is a naked person subject to humiliation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is it possible to humiliate him in this state? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Naked? </span>It means a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a gust </span>of wind <span class="gemarra-regular">cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and lifted his clothes, and </span>then this one <span class="gemarra-regular">came and raised them higher and humiliated him.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bathhouse, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>one in <span class="gemarra-regular">a bathhouse subject to humiliation? </span>In a place where people stand naked, can a person be humiliated by having his clothes removed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he humiliated him </span>not in an actual bathhouse, but <span class="gemarra-regular">on the bank of the river, </span>which is a place where people behave more discreetly when they undress.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another who was <span class="gemarra-regular">asleep, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> before he awoke, so he never knew of his humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is his dilemma? Rav Zevid said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is his dilemma: </span>Is the compensation for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">due to embarrassment, </span>i.e., that his feelings suffer because of what he experienced, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">died and does not have </span>that feeling of <span class="gemarra-regular">embarrassment? Or perhaps </span>the compensation for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to disgrace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., lessening of his honor in front of other people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">disgraced him. </span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to the dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: A deaf-mute and a minor have </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation; an imbecile does not have </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to disgrace, this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor, </span>who can be disgraced; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if you say </span>that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation? </span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you mean by stating that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to disgrace? </span>If compensation is granted due to disgrace, then <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile </span>should receive compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">have no greater humiliation than this. </span>It is impossible to degrade him further.
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, resolve from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to disgrace, as, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment? </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Pappa said </span>with regard to a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, cited later by the Gemara: The case involves a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached an age in which when <span class="gemarra-regular">others humiliate him he feels humiliation; here, too, </span>say that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case involving a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached an age in which when <span class="gemarra-regular">others humiliate him he feels humiliation. </span>This is how Rav Zevid understands the dilemma of Rabbi Abba bar Memel.
Rav Pappa explains Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s dilemma differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is his dilemma: </span>Is the compensation for humiliation <span class="gemarra-regular">due to his own embarrassment, and </span>this one <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>and was not embarrassed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the compensation for humiliation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family’s humiliation, </span>and therefore the one who humiliated him must pay compensation to his family?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A deaf-mute and a minor have </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an imbecile does not have </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family’s humiliation, this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor, </span>whose family can experience humiliation based on what was done to their relative; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if you say </span>that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to his own embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation?</span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you mean by stating that the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the humiliation of members of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family? </span>If this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile </span>should receive compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The Sages say in response: If one is <span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">have no greater humiliation than this. </span>
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, resolve from this that </span>the compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">family’s humiliation, as, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment? Rav Pappa said: Yes, </span>he is subject to embarrassment, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case involving a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached an age in which when <span class="gemarra-regular">others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this distinction <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A deaf-mute has </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an imbecile does not have </span>the right to receive compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor, sometimes he ha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the right to receive compensation for humiliation, and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes he does not have </span>the right. Why is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case where he has the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has reached the stage in which <span class="gemarra-regular">when others humiliate him he feels humiliation; that </span>case where he does not have the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>reached the stage in which <span class="gemarra-regular">when others humiliate him he feels humiliation. </span>
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who humiliates a blind person </span>is liable to pay compensation. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person </span>who humiliated another <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation. And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this way Rabbi Yehuda deemed </span>a blind person <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable to be exile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for killing unintentionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">and from </span>being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes, and from </span>being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span>-imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">capital punishment, </span>if he transgresses a prohibition for which the Torah mandates one of these punishments.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">derives </span>a verbal analogy to: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your eye </span>shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 25:12), stated with regard to humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">from: “Your eye </span>shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 19:21), stated with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses. </span>The analogy teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of conspiring witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">blind people </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>included, as blind people cannot see events occur in order to testify, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of compensation for humiliation, <span class="gemarra-regular">blind people </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>included.
The Gemara continues its explanation: Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable to be exiled </span>for killing unintentionally? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states with regard to an unintentional killing: “Or with any stone, whereby one may die, <span class="gemarra-regular">seeing him not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Numbers 35:23),this formulation serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude a blind person; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: </span>The verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a blind person.</span>
The Gemara explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? </span>He would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: </span>The verse states with regard to an unintentional killing, without any further limiting clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As when one goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this includes <span class="gemarra-regular">even a blind person; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One wrote </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Seeing him not” </span>(Numbers 35:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a blind person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is the reasoning of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir? The Merciful One wrote </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Seeing him not” </span>(Numbers 35:23), apparently <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>one who happened to not see the one he killed; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Merciful One wrote </span>in the Torah: “Who kills his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">unawares”</span> (Deuteronomy 19:4), apparently <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a blind person, who is not aware of where others are standing. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is a restriction following a restriction, and </span>there is a hermeneutical principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a restriction following a restriction </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">only to amplif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and include additional cases. Therefore, a blind person is included in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of those liable to be exiled for unintentional killing.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>respond to this reasoning? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse: “Who kills his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">unawares,” </span>does not exclude one who could not see, but rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it comes to exclude </span>one who was <span class="gemarra-regular">intending </span>to kill a particular person and unintentionally killed someone else. That killer is not exiled.
The Gemara continues to explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Why did he deem a blind person exempt from being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span>-imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">capital punishment? </span>That <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy to: “But if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a killer; </span>the killer shall be put to death” (Numbers 36:15), written with regard to capital punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">from: </span>“You shall appoint for yourselves cities, to be cities of refuge for you, that <span class="gemarra-regular">a killer</span> who killed any person unintentionally may flee there” (Numbers 35:11), written with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable to be exiled. </span>
Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt from being among <span class="gemarra-regular">those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes? </span>That <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy to: “Then it shall be, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilty </span>one deserves to be beaten” (Deuteronomy 25:2), written with regard to lashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">from: </span>“Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is <span class="gemarra-regular">guilty </span>of death” (Numbers 35:31), written with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span>-imposed <span class="gemarra-regular">capital punishment. </span>
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have humiliation, </span>

Daf 87a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt </span>a blind person <span class="gemarra-regular">from all judgments </span>of civil law <span class="gemarra-regular">that are in the Torah. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states </span>with regard to an unintentional killing: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood, according to these laws” </span>(Numbers 35:24), to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is subject to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a smiter and to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an avenger of blood is subject to </span>civil <span class="gemarra-regular">laws, and anyone who is not subject to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a smiter or to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an avenger of blood, </span>including a blind person, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not subject to </span>civil <span class="gemarra-regular">laws.</span>
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have, </span>i.e., receive, compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt </span>a blind person <span class="gemarra-regular">from all mitzvo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “And this is the commandment, statutes, and laws” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:1), to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is subject to </span>civil <span class="gemarra-regular">laws is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">commandments and statutes, and anyone who is not subject to </span>civil <span class="gemarra-regular">laws, </span>including a blind person, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not subject to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">commandments and statutes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, </span>who was blind, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: At first, I would say: </span>If I hear <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A blind person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from the mitzvot, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that I am not commanded and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">I perform mitzvot. </span>
Rav Yosef continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">But now that I heard this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>One who is <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded and performs </span>a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">is greate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is not commanded and performs </span>it, I say: If I hear <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to me </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that as I am commanded, I have more reward.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stringency with regard to a person </span>who caused injury, <span class="gemarra-regular">compared to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an ox </span>that caused injury: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the person pays </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation; and </span>if he caused a woman to miscarry he also <span class="gemarra-regular">pays compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring, </span>as the verse states (see Exodus 21:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox </span>that caused injury, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>miscarried <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who strikes his father or his mothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but did not cause them </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">a bruise, </span>and therefore is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who injures another on Yom Kippur, </span>the punishment for which is not court-imposed capital punishment, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of </span>the five types of indemnity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures a Hebrew slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of </span>the five types of indemnity. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>suffered <span class="gemarra-regular">during the time that </span>the injured slave <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to </span>the one that injured him. Since the right to the slave’s labor belongs to his master, his inability to work is his master’s loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of </span>the five types of indemnity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves do not have humiliation, </span>so the one who injures the slave pays only the other four types of indemnity.
The mishna continues: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an encounter with them is disadvantageous. </span>In other words, no favorable outcome is possible for someone involved in an incident with one of these people, since <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures them </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they were </span>the ones <span class="gemarra-regular">who injured others, they </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is because they lack awareness and are not responsible for their actions. 
Similarly, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave and </span>a married <span class="gemarra-regular">woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an encounter with them is disadvantageous, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures them </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>were the ones <span class="gemarra-regular">who injured others, they </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because they do not have money with which to pay compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But they pay </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">at a later time. </span>The exemption is only temporary, as, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the woman becomes divorced </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">the slave becomes emancipated, </span>and they then have their own money, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>compensation. 
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who strikes his father or his mothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and causes them </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">a bruise, or one who injures another on Shabbat, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the five types of indemnity, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is judged with </span>losing <span class="gemarra-regular">his life. </span>The court imposes capital punishment for these acts, so there is no additional monetary punishment. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one who injures his own Canaanite slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the five types of indemnity, because his slave is his property. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses a case of compensation for injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures the minor daughter of others, to whom </span>does he pay compensation for the <span class="gemarra-regular">injury?</span>
Rabbi Elazar explains the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since the Merciful One granted the profits of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">youth to the father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he receives her betrothal money, compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">injury also belongs to her father? What is the reason </span>that he should receive it? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one who injured her <span class="gemarra-regular">lowered her monetary </span>value, resulting in her father receiving gifts of lesser value when she is betrothed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the profits of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">youth that the Merciful One grante</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to</span> her father, <span class="gemarra-regular">because if he desires to give her </span>in marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">afflicted with boils</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he can give </span>her to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">injury, since if he desires to injure her he may not injure her, </span>just as he may not injure any other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One did not grant him </span>the right to receive the compensation when she is injured. 

Daf 87b

Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Elazar in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah granted the father only the profits of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">youth </span>and nothing else. Therefore, compensation for the injury goes to the daughter. Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rav’s statement based on the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures a Hebrew slave </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for all of </span>the five types of indemnity. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>compensation for <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>occurring <span class="gemarra-regular">during the time that </span>the injured slave <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to </span>the one that injured him. This should be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a minor daughter as well, that since the father has the right to the earnings of his minor daughter, he should receive the compensation for her loss of livelihood. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav concedes with regard to </span>compensation for her <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>that it is paid to the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">since her earnings belong to her father until the time of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">adulthood, </span>and therefore her inability to work is her father’s loss.
Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rav’s statement based on a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures his adult son </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>his compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately. </span>If one injured <span class="gemarra-regular">his minor son he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">make a safe investment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">segulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> with the compensation money. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures his minor daughter </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and moreover, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">others who injured her, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to give </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">to her father. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too </span>here, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the daughter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of livelihood </span>alone, which is paid to the father. The other types of indemnity are paid to the daughter.
The Gemara questions the first ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that if a father injured <span class="gemarra-regular">his adult son he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>his compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately? And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from that which is taught in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures the sons or daughters of others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">adults he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give them </span>their compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately; </span>if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">minors he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">make a safe investment for them. </span>If one injures <span class="gemarra-regular">his own sons or daughters, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying them compensation. 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the father is exempt, it is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are dependent on </span>their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">tabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for support. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that the father is liable, it is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are not dependent on his table.</span>
The Gemara challenges this resolution of the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you interpret the first </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are not dependent on his table? If so, say the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures his minor daughter </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, and moreover, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">others who injured her, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to give </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">to her father. </span>If this is a case where the daughter is not dependent upon her father for support, then the one who injured her would be <span class="gemarra-regular">required to give </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">to her, because she needs </span>to provide her own <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance.</span>
The Gemara continues its challenge. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a master can say to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">slave: Work for me but I will not feed you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a master is not legally obligated to provide sustenance for his slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Canaanite slave, as </span>the master can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Work </span>for me <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day, and at night go aroun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>beg, <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat. But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Hebrew slave, as it is written </span>with regard to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Because he fares well with you” </span>(Deuteronomy 15:16), indicating that the Hebrew slave must be <span class="gemarra-regular">“with you” in foo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">“with you” in drink, </span>i.e., the Hebrew slave is entitled to live with his master as an equal, the master may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>compel the slave to serve him unless he feeds him. <span class="gemarra-regular">All the more so </span>is it not the case with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter, </span>that she is not required to beg for her sustenance and should receive the compensation herself?
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava, son of Rav Ulla, said </span>concerning a similar matter (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 43a): This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary only for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">surplus, </span>i.e., money that a woman earns beyond what she needs for her essential sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary only for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">surplus. </span>If the compensation for injury is more than the daughter requires for her sustenance, the additional sum is paid to her father.
The Gemara again challenges the resolution of the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interpret the latter </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> discussing one who injures the children of another? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sons <span class="gemarra-regular">are dependent on </span>their father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">table. </span>But the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also stated: If they are <span class="gemarra-regular">adults, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">give them </span>their compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately; </span>if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">minors, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">make a safe investment for them. Why </span>does he make a safe investment for them? Shouldn’t he be <span class="gemarra-regular">required to give </span>the compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">to their father?</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>about receiving money that would go to his child is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in a matter that causes </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">a loss, </span>as in a case where the father himself injured his child and would need to pay compensation. But <span class="gemarra-regular">in a matter that comes from elsewhere, </span>as in a case where someone else injured his child, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not particular </span>about receiving the money, and it is paid to the child.
The Gemara challenges that response: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">a found </span>item a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes to </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">from elsewhere, and </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>about receiving it? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">profit that comes to </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">from elsewhere, and they do not </span>suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">physical pain in </span>obtaining <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>about receiving the money, as he does not feel that the children deserve it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an injury, where they </span>suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">physical pain and it comes to them from elsewhere, </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is not particular </span>about receiving the compensation paid to his child.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there, </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, isn’t it discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the daughter suffers <span class="gemarra-regular">physical pain, and </span>it is a matter that <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to her from elsewhere, and </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>about receiving the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: And moreover, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">others who injured her, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to give </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">to her father? </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is a captious man, </span>which is evident from the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>his children <span class="gemarra-regular">are not dependent on his table. </span>A man like this <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular even about matters that come to them from elsewhere. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the latter <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it discusses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a captious man, </span>which is evident from the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>his children <span class="gemarra-regular">are dependent on his table. When he is particular </span>about receiving the money, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in a matter that causes him a loss, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">in a matter that comes to them from elsewhere, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not particular. </span>
The two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> stated that the father makes a safe investment for his minor children with the compensation paid to them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says: </span>The father should purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scroll </span>for his child. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna, says: </span>The father should purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">a date palm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from which </span>the child <span class="gemarra-regular">will consume dates.</span>
The Gemara comments that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> of Eretz Yisrael discussed the same issue as did those in Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so says Reish Lakish: The Torah granted the father only the profits of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">youth, </span>and nothing else. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The father receives <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the compensation for his daughter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wound. </span>
The Gemara objects: Does it <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that the father receives compensation for his daughter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wound, </span>which, unlike an injury, does not diminish his daughter’s value? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even Rabbi Elazar raised his dilemma only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an injury, </span>

Daf 88a

by <span class="gemarra-regular">which he lowered her monetary </span>value, diminishing the amount of money that her father will receive for her betrothal. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wound, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">which he did not lower her monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar did not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a dilemma.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">wounded her on her face, and he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">lowered her monetary </span>value, as this affects the amount of money that her father will receive for her betrothal. 
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to others </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for all of the five types of indemnity. Rabbi Yehuda says: Canaanite slaves do not have humiliation, so one who injures a slave pays only the other four types of indemnity. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? </span>The Gemara explains: The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states</span> with regard to the indemnity of humiliation: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When men strive together, a man and his brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 25:11). The formulation “and his brother” teaches that the payment of compensation for humiliation is applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to someone who has </span>a relationship of <span class="gemarra-regular">brotherhood </span>with a Jew. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding </span>a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, who does not have </span>a relationship of <span class="gemarra-regular">brotherhoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with Jews. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Sages, </span>who hold that a Canaanite slave is included in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of compensation for humiliation, maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>the Jews’ <span class="gemarra-regular">brother with regard to</span> the observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>as a Canaanite slave is obligated to observe most mitzvot. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that slaves are not in the category of brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">conspiring witnesses </span>who testify that a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>committed a sin punishable by capital punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be put to death </span>by the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “You shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:19), and the slave is not considered a brother. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: The </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states </span>with regard to conspiring witnesses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall put away the evil from your midst,” </span>indicating that the punishment for conspiring witnesses should be applied <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>including when they testified about a slave.
The Gemara raises another challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Sages, </span>who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave should be fit for kingship, </span>as it is written: “One from among your brothers shall you set a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15). The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to your reasoning, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> disqualifying <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert </span>from being king <span class="gemarra-regular">should pose a difficulty for you according to all </span>opinions, both according to the opinion of the Sages and of Rabbi Yehuda: Why is a convert not fit to be a king, as he is certainly in the category of brother? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the verse states: “One from among your brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> shall you set a king over you,” which indicates that the king must be <span class="gemarra-regular">from the choicest among your brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which disqualifies both converts and slaves.
The Gemara challenges further: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Sages, </span>who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave should be fit to bear witness, as it is written: “And behold, the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:18). If a slave is considered a brother, why is he not eligible to testify in court?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: You cannot say </span>that a slave is fit to bear <span class="gemarra-regular">witness, </span>because the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>of a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived by an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a woman, who is fit to enter into the congregation, </span>i.e., to marry a Jew of fit lineage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from bearing witness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, who is not fit to enter the congregation, is it not logical that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from bearing witness? </span>
The Gemara counters this derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about a woman? </span>She is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that she is not fit to </span>undergo the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision. </span>Would <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that from the fact that a woman is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <span class="gemarra-regular">for a slave, who is fit to </span>undergo <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision? </span>The Gemara responds: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor shall prove </span>that one’s fitness to undergo circumcision is not germane to one’s qualification to bear witness, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the mitzva to undergo <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision, and </span>yet he <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified from bearing witness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
This is countered: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about a minor? </span>He is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that he is not </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot. </span>Would <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that from the fact that a minor is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <span class="gemarra-regular">for a slave, who is </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot? </span>The Gemara responds: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman shall prove </span>the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as she is </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the derivation has reverted </span>to its starting point. <span class="gemarra-regular">The aspect of this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is not like the aspect of that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">aspect of that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is not like the aspect of this </span>case, as each case has its own unique <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Their common denominator </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>both a woman and a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">all the mitzvot and are disqualified from bearing witness. I will also bring </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the slave </span>for inclusion in this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">all the mitzvo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and is disqualified from bearing witness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
This derivation is rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about their common denominator? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>a woman or a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a man, </span>and this is why they are disqualified from bearing witness. Would <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that from the fact that they are disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <span class="gemarra-regular">for a slave, who is a man? </span>
The Gemara offers a different derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a slave is disqualified from bearing witness <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, </span>who is disqualified from bearing witness. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about a robber? </span>He is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that his actions caused him </span>to be disqualified. Would <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that from the fact that a robber is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <span class="gemarra-regular">for a slave, whose actions did not cause him </span>to be unfit?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from a robber and from one of these </span>other two, either a woman or a minor. Their common denominator is that they do not observe all the mitzvot and are disqualified from bearing witness. So too, a slave does not observe all the mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar, son of Ravina, said </span>another derivation. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children” </span>(Deuteronomy 24:16), meaning that people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">children. </span>This is referring to Canaanite slaves, whose children are not considered to be related to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to interpret the verse according to its straightforward meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we say: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,” </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">by the testimony of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">children, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write: Fathers shall not be put to death for their children. What </span>does the verse teach by stating only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Children,” </span>without the word their? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>this formulation <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">children.</span>
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>when the end of the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Nor shall children be put to death for fathers” </span>(Deuteronomy 24:16), does this <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>mean that people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">children who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers? But </span>if that were the case, it would <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from bearing witness, </span>as one who converts no longer shares common lineage with his parents. 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert, although he has no </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with those <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>him, i.e., his parents, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him, i.e., his children. This serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a slave, who has no </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage either </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him.
The Sages prove that a convert is fit to bear witness: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert is disqualified from bearing witness, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write: Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, according to </span>the interpretation <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say: </span>Fathers <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on the testimony of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">children; and let the Merciful One </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">write: “Nor shall children be put to death for fathers,” from which you learn two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">children shall not be put to death by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers, and another, </span>that people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">children who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers, </span>i.e., converts.
The Gemara continues the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave </span>being disqualified from bearing witness <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived by an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert: And just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert, that it is </span>the case concerning those <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has no </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage, but </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage, </span>and he is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from bearing witness, </span>then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, who has no </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him, all the more so <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified from bearing witness? </span>
The Gemara continues the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One </span>did not write the verse that way, but instead <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,” which indicates </span>that people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">children, learn from </span>this formulation that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave, who has no </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>is the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is disqualified from bearing witness. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert, since he has </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage </span>with those <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to bear witness.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Let the Merciful One write: Nor shall children be put to death for their fathers, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One wrote: “Nor shall children be put to death for fathers,” which indicates </span>that people <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be put to death based on </span>the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">children who do not have </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">lineage </span>with their <span class="gemarra-regular">fathers? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the Merciful One <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,” </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">also wrote </span>in the same manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Nor shall children be put to death for fathers.”</span>
§ The mishna (87a) teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, an encounter with them is disadvantageous, </span>since one who injures them is liable. But if they were the ones who injured, they are exempt. The Gemara relates an incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mother of Rav Shmuel bar Abba from </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hagroneya was married to Rabbi Abba. She wrote, </span>i.e., signed over, her <span class="gemarra-regular">propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rav Shmuel bar Abba, her son. After she died, </span>

Daf 88b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Abba went before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba </span>to claim his mother’s property. Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">established him </span>as the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">of the property, </span>in accordance with what was written in the document. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba, </span>the mother’s husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>a report of <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter before Rav Hoshaya. Rav Hoshaya went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>a report of the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yehuda. </span>Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Hoshaya: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who sold her usufruct property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which belongs to her but whose profits her husband garners, <span class="gemarra-regular">in her husband’s lifetime, and </span>then she <span class="gemarra-regular">died, the husband repossesses </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchasers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The granting of her property by means of the document is analogous to a sale, and Rabbi Abba can repossess the property from Rav Shmuel bar Abba.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba, </span>who had ruled that the property belongs to Rav Shmuel bar Abba. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: I know the mishna </span>that supports my opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 136a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>a document transferring ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> stating that the transfer should take effect immediately but the son will have use of it only <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death, the son cannot sell </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">in the father’s possession. And the father, </span>even though he retained the right to use the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot sell </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written </span>as belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to the son. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father sold </span>the property, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sold </span>to the extent that the purchaser may use it <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">dies. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the son sold </span>the property during his father’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser does not have </span>the right to use the property <span class="gemarra-regular">until the father dies. </span>
Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>if the son sold the property during his father’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">when the father dies the purchaser has </span>rights to the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this would be so <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the son died in the father’s lifetime, where </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">never came into the son’s possession. </span>
Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s analysis is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who says: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son died in the father’s lifetime, where </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">never came into the son’s possession, </span>and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the father died in the son’s lifetime, where the </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">came into the son’s possession. </span>In any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser acquired </span>the property. 
The Gemara records a dispute between the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> with regard to this point. <span class="gemarra-regular">As was stated: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the son sold </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in the father’s lifetime, and the son died in the father’s lifetime, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquire </span>the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: The purchaser acquired </span>the property. 
The Gemara explains the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquire </span>the property, because he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: When the mishna teaches </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son sold </span>the property during his father’s lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser does not acquire </span>any rights to use the property <span class="gemarra-regular">until the father dies, and </span>one could infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">when the father dies the purchaser has </span>rights to the property, the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the son did not die during the father’s lifetime, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">came into the son’s possession </span>upon the father’s death, before the purchaser acquired it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son died in the father’s lifetime, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come into the son’s possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">even when the father dies the purchaser does not have </span>rights to the property.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered to be like ownership of the item itself. </span>Even though the property itself did not belong to the father, it is as though the father owned the property, because all of the produce belonged to him in practice. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that did not belong to him. </span>
The Gemara explains the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser acquired </span>the property based on this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the mishna teaches </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son sold </span>the property during his father’s lifetime <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser does not have </span>any right to use the property <span class="gemarra-regular">until the father dies, </span>and one could infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event, when the father dies the purchaser has </span>rights to the property, the mishna means that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son did not die in the father’s lifetime, where the </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">came into the son’s possession, and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the son died in the father’s lifetime, where the </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come into the son’s possession. </span>In either case, the <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser acquired </span>the property.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. And </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that belonged to him.</span>
The Gemara returns to the discussion of the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba. <span class="gemarra-regular">And now </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">us, whether </span>if one discusses the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba and whether </span>one discusses the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, </span>that ownership of the rights to use an item and to its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: If </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce is considered to be like ownership of the item itself, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">when the father dies and the son </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">died in the father’s lifetime, why does the purchaser have </span>rights to the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t he sell </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">that did not belong to him? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of</span> the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself? </span>Therefore, Rav Shmuel bar Abba should receive the property transferred to him by his mother, as the fact that the husband owned the rights to its produce does not limit her ability to transfer her property to her son.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">brought back </span>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s reply <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yehuda. </span>Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that a husband can repossess the property that his wife sold before she died, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not similar to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna </span>concerning a father who transfers his property to his son while retaining the right to garner the profits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning </span>for distinguishing between the two cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Granted, if </span>the mishna had <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the opposite </span>and stated that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who writes </span>a document transferring ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to his father </span>after his death, with the son retaining the right to garner the profits until then, and the father sold the property during his son’s lifetime, the purchaser has rights to the property after the son dies, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to resolve from </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that ownership of</span> the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself. </span>
Rav Yosef continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But now that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>specifically: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who writes </span>a document transferring ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property to his son, </span>the ability of the son to sell the property is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit to inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and already has a right to the property, and not just due to the existence of the document. In the case of Rav Shmuel bar Abba as well, the woman’s property is inherited by her husband, not her son, so she cannot transfer it to Rav Shmuel bar Abba.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that a son inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a father, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">a father does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> There is no difference between their rights to inherit from one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>even if the mishna taught a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning a son transferring his property to his father, the son’s reason for doing so could have been that <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to hide his property from his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>and wants his father to inherit from him instead. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>when a father transfers his property to his son, <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to hide his property from </span>the son’s <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers, </span>as the father has other sons but does not want them to inherit from him. Therefore, the mishna’s choice of case cannot serve as a basis for inference.
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>was Shmuel’s reason for saying that the right of a husband to the property that his wife sold before she died <span class="gemarra-regular">is not similar to our mishna</span> that states that a father does not have rights to property sold by his son? The difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Usha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an ordinance instituted with regard to a husband’s rights to his wife’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: In </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Usha </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who sold her usufruct property in her husband’s lifetime and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died, the husband repossesses </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the purchasers. </span>This ordinance was instituted only for the benefit of a husband, but not for the benefit of a father or son. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: We too learn </span>of the ordinance of Usha in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If witnesses said: <span class="gemarra-regular">We testify about so-and-so that he divorced his wife and gave </span>her the full value of the obligations recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 89a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and she is under hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and serves him, </span>i.e., she was in fact still married to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then these witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">were found to be conspiring </span>witnesses who were attempting to deny this woman the ability to ever collect payment of her marriage contract, then the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say </span>that the witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">shall pay the entire </span>value of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract. Rather, </span>the court says that they shall pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage of her marriage contract. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the financial advantage of her marriage contract? </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> how much a person </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">want to give </span>to purchase the rights <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract, </span>taking into account the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that if she becomes widowed or divorced </span>the purchaser will receive its full value, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if she dies </span>during her husband’s lifetime, <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband will inherit her </span>property and the purchaser will receive nothing. 
Rav Idi bar Avin continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no ordinance of Usha, why would her husband inherit </span>from<span class="gemarra-regular"> her? </span>Let the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">sell her marriage contract entirely</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is not a proof for the existence of the ordinance of Usha, because even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>there is no ordinance, and the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the woman retains the right to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct property, </span>would they also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the woman retains the right to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to guaranteed property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is listed among the possessions she brought into the marriage but is entirely under her husband’s authority? In any event, there is property that she does not have the right to sell and that the husband would inherit if she dies, regardless of whether or not there is an ordinance of Usha, so the marriage contract could not be sold for its full value.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage, since </span>discussion of this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">came to us, let us say something about it. </span>The money received for selling the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage is </span>given only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> For if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to say that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the conspiring <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>who have been rendered liable to pay a penalty to the wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her: What loss have we caused you </span>by testifying that you had received payment of your marriage contract? Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you were to sell it for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage,</span> your <span class="gemarra-regular">husband would have taken </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from you. Rav Shalman said </span>in response: She still would incur a loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is a gain </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the household. </span>Even if the husband were to be the one to receive the payment from the sale, the financial situation of the household would be improved, leading to a concrete benefit for the wife as well. This offsets the wife’s potential loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the money received for selling the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage </span>of the marriage contract is given only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wife, and the husband does not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">garner the profits </span>from that money or from property the wife would purchase with that money. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? The Sages instituted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the profits </span>of her property are <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the husband, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not institute </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the profits of the profits </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">for him.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from the study hall of Rav they said: We learned </span>a source <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Usha </span>in the mishna (87a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave or </span>a married <span class="gemarra-regular">woman, an encounter with them is disadvantageous, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures them </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>were the ones who <span class="gemarra-regular">injured others they </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>because they do not have money with which to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no ordinance of Usha, </span>there would be a method by which a married woman can obtain money with which to pay, as the court can have <span class="gemarra-regular">her sell </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct property and give </span>the money received <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the one she injured. It can therefore be inferred from the mishna that a woman cannot sell her usufruct property, in accordance with the ordinance of Usha.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, though indeed there is an ordinance of Usha, and she cannot fully sell </span>her usufruct property, <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>should nevertheless be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct property for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage,</span> i.e., the purchaser will pay her for the future rights to the property in the event that she gets divorced or is widowed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she will give </span>that money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the one she injured. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she does not have </span>usufruct property of which she can sell the future rights. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>there is no source from the mishna for the ordinance of Usha, as the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she does not have </span>usufruct property to sell.
The Gemara questions the ruling of the mishna: Why does the mishna assert that a married woman will not have money with which to pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">but she should sell </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract and give </span>the money received <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the one she injured? The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>ruling of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for a man to remain </span>living together <span class="gemarra-regular">with his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">even one hour without </span>her having <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract. </span>Therefore, the woman cannot sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>for the ruling of Rabbi Meir? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that she will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not be demeaned in his eyes such that </span>he will easily <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her, </span>as he would not suffer any adverse financial consequences by divorcing her. The Gemara asks: If that is the reason, then <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>when she sold her marriage contract to others, the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>easily <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her, as, if he would divorce her, those who purchased </span>her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">will come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract from </span>the husband. It makes no difference to the husband whether he will have to pay the marriage contract to her or to the purchasers. Therefore, the reason for the ruling of the mishna cannot be based upon the statement of Rabbi Meir. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> the reason she is not required to sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to pay the one she injured is that the <span class="gemarra-regular">financial advantage </span>of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">words, </span>i.e., not a specific possession, but a legal entity that simply creates the possibility to collect its value at a later date. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">words are not mortgaged </span>for the payment of debts, in this case her debt to the injured party. 
The Gemara questions this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why not? </span>Why is financial advantage not mortgaged? <span class="gemarra-regular">They are words that are sold for dinars. </span>Since the financial advantage of her marriage contract has a market value, it is mortgaged to pay the debt to the injured party. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>she is not required to sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells a promissory not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">went back and forgave </span>the debtor his debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forgiven, </span>and the promissory note is left valueless, since the debtor essentially had a non-transferable obligation to the creditor alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even </span>the seller’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heir can forgive </span>the debt. Since there is a concern that the woman will forgive the debt of her marriage contract after having sold it, causing a loss to the purchaser, she is not required to sell it.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Let her <span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>the financial advantage of the marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the one she injured, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if she </span>happens to <span class="gemarra-regular">forgive </span>the debt of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband, she will forgive it. </span>Just as it is generally permitted for one to sell a promissory note despite the fact that he could then forgive the debt, the same should hold true in this case as well.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>matter that will engender a benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband, she </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly forgive </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>so that he will not have to pay the marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">causing </span>a definite <span class="gemarra-regular">loss to that purchaser</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>by having the woman sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract in a case where she will certainly forgive the debt, the Sages will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be willing to <span class="gemarra-regular">cause a </span>definite <span class="gemarra-regular">loss to </span>the purchaser. 
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that she should <span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">to that one whom she injured </span>in order to receive the money <span class="gemarra-regular">for the financial advantage, </span>

Daf 89b

so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if she </span>were to <span class="gemarra-regular">forgive </span>the debt of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband, </span>the one she injured <span class="gemarra-regular">would not lose </span>anything, <span class="gemarra-regular">as now as well she is not giving him any </span>payment, one could respond that <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>matter that will engender a benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband, she will certainly forgive </span>the debt with regard to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we do not trouble the courts </span>to supervise the sale of the financial advantage <span class="gemarra-regular">without cause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the reason she does not sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to obtain money with which to pay the injured party is that she would then forgive the debt of the marriage contract, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:22): <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly,</span> in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>was the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who injured her husban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">she has not lost her marriage contract </span>as a result, as he does not collect compensation from the properties she brought into the marriage that are enumerated in the marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does she not lose it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let her sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to her husband </span>in order to obtain the money to compensate him <span class="gemarra-regular">for that injury </span>that she caused him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if she will forgive </span>the debt of her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to her husband there will be no loss </span>for the purchaser, i.e., her husband. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for a man to remain </span>living together <span class="gemarra-regular">with his wife </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">even one hour </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>her having <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract. </span>Therefore, the woman cannot sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to her husband. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>for the ruling of Rabbi Meir? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that she will not be demeaned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his eyes such that </span>he will easily <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>if she were to sell the marriage contract to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her and collect </span>the properties listed in the marriage contract as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for his injuries from her. If that is so, even now, </span>where she does not sell her marriage contract to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will divorce her, and </span>once she is divorced, he will <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the properties listed in the marriage contract as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for his injuries </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from her. </span>Preventing her from selling the marriage contract to him will not serve as an impediment to his divorcing her. 
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a large </span>sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that because </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">that slight </span>sum due him as compensation for his injuries, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not </span>be willing to <span class="gemarra-regular">lose </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>sum that he would have to pay were he to divorce her. Therefore, the marriage contract does serve as an impediment to his divorcing her. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>in fact the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let them establish </span>her marriage contract <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>additional, sum, <span class="gemarra-regular">let her sell it to</span> her husband as payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for his injuries. </span>Since she will be left with a marriage contract of standard value, they would be allowed to remain living together.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not larger than </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">his injury was </span>assessed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">four dinars, and because </span>of a gain of <span class="gemarra-regular">four dinars, </span>the husband would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be willing to <span class="gemarra-regular">lose twenty-fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> dinars, which is the value of a marriage contract required by Torah law. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in the latter case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as she does not sell </span>her marriage contract to obtain money to pay damages <span class="gemarra-regular">while she is under him, </span>i.e., married to her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, she does not lose</span> the value of her marriage contract to pay damages <span class="gemarra-regular">while she is under him.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">times </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">she will be found to have lost </span>the value of her marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what are the circumstances? </span>It would be a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than </span>the sum recorded in <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage contract</span> required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law. </span>In that case she would be obligated to sell the portion of the marriage contract representing the additional amount in order to obtain money with which to compensate the one she injured.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we arrive at </span>the stipulation in the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">male offspring </span>inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and it is not discussing the sale of a marriage contract in general. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: Just as </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stipulates <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who sells her marriage contract to others does not lose </span>the future implementation of the stipulation in the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">male offspring </span>inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and Rava clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The need for <span class="gemarra-regular">money is what </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>to sell it under <span class="gemarra-regular">duress</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and she did not intend to abrogate her sons’ rights to inherit the property in the future. Rava continues his explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>a woman who <span class="gemarra-regular">sells her marriage contract to her husband does not lose </span>the future implementation of the stipulation in the <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">male offspring </span>inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and Rava clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The need for <span class="gemarra-regular">money is what </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>to sell it under <span class="gemarra-regular">duress.</span>
§ The Gemara returns to the earlier discussion and suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that the issue whether or not there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinance of Usha </span>instituting that the wife cannot sell her usufruct property <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves </span>that the woman brought into the marriage as <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">are emancipated by </span>having <span class="gemarra-regular">a tooth </span>knocked out <span class="gemarra-regular">or an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eye </span>blinded <span class="gemarra-regular">by the woman, </span>i.e., the wife, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when the owner of a slave knocks out the slave’s tooth or blinds his eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>emancipated by having a tooth knocked out or an eye blinded <span class="gemarra-regular">by the man, </span>i.e., the husband, as he is not their owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The slave is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>emancipated if his tooth was knocked out or his eye was blinded, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor by the man nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by the woman. </span>
The Gemara continues its analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">They assumed that everyone </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce, </span>which the husband has with regard to usufruct property, is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like ownership </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the item itself, </span>which is why the husband is not considered the owner of the slaves. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>so that the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to this: That the one who says </span>that the slave is emancipated if he was struck <span class="gemarra-regular">by the woman </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Usha? </span>Since she retains the right to sell her usufruct property, she is considered the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of their being emancipated. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who says </span>that the slave is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>emancipated if he was struck <span class="gemarra-regular">by the man and not </span>if he was struck <span class="gemarra-regular">by the woman </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an ordinance of Usha. </span>Since she cannot sell her usufruct property, she is not considered to be the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of their being emancipated. 
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>perhaps it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an ordinance of Usha. But here, </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring to the time <span class="gemarra-regular">before the ordinance </span>was instituted, and since the wife had the right to sell her usufruct property, she is considered the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of their being emancipated, while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring to the time <span class="gemarra-regular">after the ordinance </span>was instituted, and since she could no longer sell her usufruct property, she is not considered to be the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of their being emancipated. 
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are referring to the time <span class="gemarra-regular">after the ordinance </span>was instituted, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in each <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an ordinance of Usha. Rather, according to the one who says </span>that the slave is emancipated if he is struck <span class="gemarra-regular">by the woman but not </span>if he is struck <span class="gemarra-regular">by the man, what is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava said: </span>

Daf 90a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Consecratio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of an item to the Temple, the advent of the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened brea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> taking effect upon a leavened food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">emancipatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">abrogate </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">lien </span>that exists upon them. Therefore, the emancipation of a slave resulting from the knocking out of his tooth or the blinding of his eye abrogates the lien that the husband has on the slave as usufruct property, leaving the woman as the solitary owner.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>According to this explanation, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that the slave is not emancipated when he is struck by the woman holds that the lien of the husband is not abrogated, which would run counter to the statement of Rava. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No;</span> it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that agrees with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>that a lien is abrogated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here </span>the reason why the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that the husband’s lien on the slave is not abrogated is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages strengthened the lien of a husban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on his wife’s property, and it is only this type of lien that is not abrogated by emancipation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> of the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">hold that there is n</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ordinance of Usha, and here, they disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the question whether <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of the item itself. </span>In this case, the husband enjoys the usage of the slave while the wife owns the slave himself. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that rules that the slave is not emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is also considered to be an owner, and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that rules that the slave is emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is not considered to be an owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the dispute with regard to the question whether ownership of the rights to use an item and to its produce is like ownership of the item itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dispute between these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells his</span> Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave to another, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">contracte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with him </span>that the sale is effected <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">will serve </span>the seller for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days </span>before he is transferred to the purchaser, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the original master enjoys the usage of the slave and the purchaser is the owner of the slave. 
As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This ruling does not apply in the case where a master strikes his Canaanite slave and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two and then dies, in which case the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this latter <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that during those thirty days, only the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A day or two days. </span>Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first owner is included in this exemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is under his </span>authority, as he enjoys the usage of the slave, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of the item itself. </span>The status of the first owner as the owner also negates the possibility that the second owner would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and he would not be included in the exemption.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that only the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>owner <span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A day or two days, because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is his money,</span> i.e., property, but the first owner is not included in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: A day or two days, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its produce </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like ownership of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> item itself. </span>Therefore, the first owner does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A day or two days. This </span>one, the first owner, is included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is under his </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the second owner, is included <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is his money. </span>The Gemara explains the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is uncertain, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">ownership of </span>the rights to use an item and to <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ownership of the item itself, </span>in which case only the first owner would be exempt, or <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ownership of the item itself, </span>in which case only the second owner would be exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>where there is an <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital </span>law, the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, neither of them would receive court-imposed capital punishment in this case. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are not </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A day or two days, </span>and both would receive court-imposed capital punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the second owner, would be liable to receive it <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not under his </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, the first owner, would receive it <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not his money. </span>Rabbi Eliezer holds that one is required both to own the slave himself and enjoy the usage of the slave to be included in the exemption. 
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer?</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; <span class="gemarra-regular">for he is his money” </span>(Exodus 21:21), and Rabbi Eliezer understands this to be referring to a slave that is <span class="gemarra-regular">his money </span>alone, a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">that is unique to him, </span>and therefore this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose</span> opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which Ameimar says: </span>If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a woman, </span>i.e., a husband or a wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">who sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">usufruct property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is owned by the wife but used by the husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not accomplish anything, </span>as the sale does not take effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is his statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>who holds that one is considered to be an owner only if he both owns the item itself and enjoys the usage of that item.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught that which the Sages taught: One who is a half-slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half-freeman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly, a slave belonging to two partners, are not emancipated </span>when injured by one of their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>one of their <span class="gemarra-regular">extremities that do not regenerate, </span>i.e., the twenty-four extremities whose injury by an owner emancipates a slave? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This is what </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say in the name of Rava: It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. </span>
He explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“his money” </span>indicates a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">that is unique to him? Here too, </span>since the verse states with regard to the emancipation of a slave resulting from his master striking him: “And if a man smite the eye of <span class="gemarra-regular">his slave” </span>(Exodus 21:26), this is referring to his slave <span class="gemarra-regular">that is unique to him. </span>Therefore, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of emancipation would not apply to a slave not fully owned by one master. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strike</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili </span>that he must give him <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">slapped </span>another on the cheek, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him two hundred dinars. </span>If he slapped him on the cheek with <span class="gemarra-regular">the back of his hand, </span>which is more degrading than a slap with the palm, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him four hundred dinars.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he pulled his ear, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled out his hair, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">spat </span>at him <span class="gemarra-regular">and his spittle reached him, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he removed </span>the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak from him, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he uncovered the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head of a woman in the marketplace, </span>in all of these cases, he must <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred dinars. </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle </span>of assessing payment for humiliation caused to another: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>evaluated <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the honor of </span>the one who was humiliated, as the Gemara will explain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: Even </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor among the Jewish people, they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property </span>and were impoverished. And their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, </span>and are all of prominent lineage.
The mishna relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And an incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving one who uncovered the head of a woman in the marketplace, </span>and the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Akiva </span>to request that he render the assailant liable to pay for the humiliation that she suffered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to give her four hundred dinars. </span>The man <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">My teacher, give me time </span>to pay the penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">gave him time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The man then <span class="gemarra-regular">waited for her </span>until <span class="gemarra-regular">she was standing by the opening of her courtyard, and he broke a jug in front of her, and </span>there was the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">about an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">issa</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of oil inside </span>the jug. The woman then <span class="gemarra-regular">exposed her </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">head and she was wettin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metapaḥat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>her hand in the oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">and placing her hand on her hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to make use of the oil. 
The man <span class="gemarra-regular">set up witnesses </span>to observe <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he came before Rabbi Akiva, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: Will I give four hundred dinars to this </span>woman for having uncovered her head? By uncovering her head for a minimal benefit, she has demonstrated that this does not cause her humiliation. 
Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You did not say anything, </span>i.e., this claim will not exempt you. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who injures himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> although it is not permitted for him </span>to do so, is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from any sort of penalty, but <span class="gemarra-regular">others who injured him </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay him. In this case as well, the man was liable to compensate the woman for shaming her, despite the fact that she did the same to herself. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who cuts </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">saplings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> although it is not permitted for him </span>to do so, as this violates the prohibition of: “You shall not destroy” (see Deuteronomy 20:19), is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from any penalty, but <span class="gemarra-regular">others </span>who cut down his saplings are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay him. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, one who strikes another must pay him one hundred dinars. The Gemara clarifies this opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Did <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that he must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that he must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>coinage, which is worth one-eighth of Tyrian coinage, i.e., twelve and a half dinars of Tyrian coinage?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof: It happened <span class="gemarra-regular">that there was a certain man who struck another </span>man, and the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yehuda Nesia </span>to request an assessment for the humiliation he suffered. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the assailant: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is I, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Give him one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the incident that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna he must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>it that it is so. 
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> did Rabbi Yehuda Nesia mean when he stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is I, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the assailant: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is I, who saw you </span>strike the man, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says </span>that the penalty for this act is <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give him one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is this to say that a witness can become a judge, </span>i.e., that one who witnessed an event can himself serve as a judge concerning the matter, and consequently Rabbi Yehuda Nesia was able to act as both witness and judge in the same case?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sanhedrin that saw one kill </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">person, some of them have become witnesses </span>and testify before the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some of them have become judges </span>to issue a verdict; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: They are all witnesses </span>to the act, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a witness cannot become a judge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara infers from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that even <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon says </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where some of </span>the members of the Sanhedrin <span class="gemarra-regular">have become witnesses and some of them have become judges, but he did not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a witness becomes a judge </span>without anyone else testifying. All the more so according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva would it not be permitted for Rabbi Yehuda Nesia to act as a judge as well as serving as a witness. 
The Gemara rejects this: One could say that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it is taught in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the Sanhedrin <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>the murder <span class="gemarra-regular">at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at which time <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">for them to practice judgment, </span>since cases of capital law may be judged only during the daytime. They were therefore not functioning as judges at that time. On the following day, testimony must be heard from some, now acting as witnesses, in front of the others, now acting as judges. By contrast, in the case of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, he was able to serve as both the witness and the judge, as he witnessed the event while functioning as a judge. 
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say</span> instead that Rabbi Yehuda Nesia did not witness the incident, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the assailant: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is I, that I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage must be paid; <span class="gemarra-regular">and these are witnesses who testify concerning you </span>that you struck the other. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give him one hundred dinars </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>coinage. 
§ The Gemara discusses the previously mentioned opinion of Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does Rabbi Akiva hold that a witness cannot become a judge?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 12:3) with regard to what is stated in the Torah concerning injuries: “And if men contend, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist” </span>(Exodus 21:18), that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaTimni says: Just as a fist is unique </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is submitted to the assembly </span>of judges to assess its ability to injure <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the witnesses </span>who attest that it was the fist used to strike, as a fist remains attached to the assailant, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>a ruling can be issued in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is submitted to the assembly </span>of judges to assess its ability to injure <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the witnesses </span>who attest that this was the item used to strike? This serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the stone that injured <span class="gemarra-regular">left the possession of the witnesses </span>and is not available to be inspected by the court to assess if it is capable of causing the purported injury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: But </span>is it the case that in all incidents of injury the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">struck him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the presence of the court, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that they know </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>hard <span class="gemarra-regular">he struck him and on what </span>part of the body <span class="gemarra-regular">he struck him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he struck him <span class="gemarra-regular">on his thigh </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he struck him on <span class="gemarra-regular">the lobe of his heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rather, the court relies on witnesses to testify about the injury. Therefore, the witnesses should be able to testify about the item used as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>was one <span class="gemarra-regular">who pushed another from the top of the roof or from the top of a building, and </span>the one who was pushed <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>as a result of the fall, do the members of <span class="gemarra-regular">the court go to the building </span>to inspect how high it is, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does the <span class="gemarra-regular">building go to the court? </span>Obviously neither, and the court relies upon the testimony of witnesses who state how tall the building is. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the building <span class="gemarra-regular">collapsed, </span>must the court <span class="gemarra-regular">rebuild it </span>in order to assess its height? The witnesses should then be able to testify about the item used as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Akiva interprets the verse differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a fist is unique </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is submitted to the witnesses </span>for them to testify about it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>a ruling can be issued in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is submitted to the witnesses </span>to testify about, despite the item’s not being available for the court to assess. 
This serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stone </span>that injured <span class="gemarra-regular">left the possession of the assailant </span>and cannot be found, and even the witnesses were unable to see it. In such a case the assailant is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment, since even the witnesses cannot testify about whether the stone was capable of inflicting the purported injuries.
The Gemara states its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to </span>Shimon HaTimni: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>all cases of injury such that the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">struck him in the presence of the court </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that they know </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>hard <span class="gemarra-regular">he struck him?</span> It can be inferred from this <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">strike him in front of them, </span>Rabbi Akiva would agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">a witness can become a judge. </span>This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that a witness cannot become a judge.
The Gemara answers that there is no proof as to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, since it may be that he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his refutation <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Shimon HaTimni, but he himself does not hold accordingly. </span>Perhaps Rabbi Akiva himself holds that if the court had witnessed the act, they would not be able to render judgment concerning it.
The Gemara quotes a related <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous ox that killed </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently went and <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">judges it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law </span>and the ox is killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not judge it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the damage that it caused. 
By contrast, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a forewarned </span>ox <span class="gemarra-regular">that killed </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently went and <span class="gemarra-regular">caused damage, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">judges it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law, </span>and the owner is liable to pay for the damage it caused, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the court <span class="gemarra-regular">goes back and judges it </span>again as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law, </span>and the ox is killed. But if the court <span class="gemarra-regular">proceeded and judged it </span>first as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not go back and judge it </span>again as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law, </span>since it has already been sentenced to be killed. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they proceeded and judged it </span>first as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law, what of it? Let them go back and judge it </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: I found the Sages of the school of Rav who were sitting and saying </span>to explain this: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this? It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon HaTimni, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a fist is unique </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is submitted to the assembly </span>of judges to assess its ability to injure <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the witnesses </span>to attest that this was the fist used to strike, so too, a ruling can be issued in the case of any item that is submitted to the assembly of judges to assess its ability to injure and to the witnesses to attest that this was the item used to strike. 

Daf 91a

Rava continues the report in their name: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, we require the evaluation of the court </span>in order to render him liable to pay for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ox that killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">once the verdict </span>was given that it to be put <span class="gemarra-regular">to death, we do not delay </span>the implementation of the verdict in order to wait <span class="gemarra-regular">for the evaluation of the court, and we do not delay its judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the monetary case is not judged. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And I, </span>Rava, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the Sages of the school of Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who does not require assessment by the court, one could explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">fled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the court cannot judge his case in his absence and cannot render him liable to pay for the damage caused by his ox. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case where the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">fled, </span>then in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">judge i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law, how does </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">judge it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law without </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of the ox being present? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>the testimony of the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>in the presence of the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fled.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, from where </span>are the damages <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>in a situation where the owner fled, as he is not here to pay the damages? The Gemara answers: They are paid <span class="gemarra-regular">from plowing. </span>The ox is rented out to plow fields, and the fees generated are used to pay the damages. Afterward, the ox is judged for the killing as a case of capital law. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an innocuous </span>ox, why did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rule that the court does not judge it as a case of monetary law? The court <span class="gemarra-regular">should judge it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary law first, and </span>the damages <span class="gemarra-regular">will be paid from </span>fees generated from renting out the animal for <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing, and then </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">should judge it </span>as a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">capital law.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said </span>in answer to this last question: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is to say </span>that the money gained from <span class="gemarra-regular">plowing is </span>considered like the <span class="gemarra-regular">superior-quality </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of its owner. </span>In other words, that money is like the rest of the owner’s estate, and is not considered to be part of the value of the ox itself. Since payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is taken only from the value of the ox itself, it follows that money received from renting out the ox to plow cannot be used to pay damages.
§ In connection with the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the court must assess whether the death can be attributed directly to the action of the assailant, the Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there an evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage </span>as well, to determine whether the act was sufficient to inflict that damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">no evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that specifically in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of killing is where we perform an evaluation? </span>The assessment is to determine whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a soul departs with this </span>assault and the assailant will be held liable or whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a soul doesn’t depart with this </span>assault and the death is attributed to other factors. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">damage, </span>perhaps we say that he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever </span>caused the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>between the two, and with regard to damage as well, the court evaluates whether the act was sufficient to inflict that damage, and if it was not, he will be exempt. 
The Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what was taught in a mishna (50b) concerning the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a pit: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death </span>when falling into it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, any </span>other excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">that have sufficient </span>depth <span class="gemarra-regular">to cause death</span> may be no less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths. </span>If any of the types of excavations <span class="gemarra-regular">were less than ten handbreadths </span>deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an ox or a donkey fell into </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">them and died, </span>the digger of the excavation is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>But if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was injured in it </span>but did not die he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay damages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>the case that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is counting </span>the handbreadths from <span class="gemarra-regular">below to above, and this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: From </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth </span>deep <span class="gemarra-regular">until ten </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage? Apparently, with regard to damage </span>he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever </span>caused the damage, even a fall into an excavation having the depth of one handbreadth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the mishna that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">an evaluation with regard to damage. </span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is counting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from above to below, and this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the excavation is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths deep then <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">death. </span>If the excavation is <span class="gemarra-regular">slightly less than ten, there is </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">damage </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">death. And actually, I will say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage, and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span>circumstance, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require that </span>there be conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby </span>the injured party <span class="gemarra-regular">could </span>reasonably <span class="gemarra-regular">be damaged by </span>whatever caused the damage.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:26): If a slave owner <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>his Canaanite slave <span class="gemarra-regular">on his ey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and blinded him, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">on his ear and deafened him, the slave is emancipated by means of these </span>wounds. If he struck <span class="gemarra-regular">near his eye and </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not see, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these </span>wounds. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the slave is not emancipated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we require an evaluation </span>of the damage, and in such a case the assumption is that the owner’s action did not suffice to cause the injury? <span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage. </span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; </span>the slave is not emancipated, <span class="gemarra-regular">because we say </span>that it is possible that it was the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">who frightened himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> resulting in his blindness or deafness, but it was not the actual strike that caused it. An injury can result from being frightened, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 6:16): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who frightens anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and thereby causes him injury is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one shouted into </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ear and deafened him, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he held him and shouted into his ea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and deafened him, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>according to human laws as well, as he physically took hold of him.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:3): With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">five types of indemnity </span>that one who injures another must pay, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluates </span>the victim as to the value of the damage that he suffered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>this payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to him immediately. </span>Payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">medical costs and loss of livelihood</span> is evaluated from the moment of injury <span class="gemarra-regular">until he is healed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the court <span class="gemarra-regular">evaluated </span>that a certain sum would be needed to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>medical costs and loss of livelihood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently the victim’s condition began <span class="gemarra-regular">progressively deterioratin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and the sum proved to be inadequate, <span class="gemarra-regular">they give him </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">only as they had evaluated him. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they evaluated him </span>as requiring a certain sum for medical costs and loss of livelihood <span class="gemarra-regular">and he healed </span>sooner than expected, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">as they had evaluated him. Learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to evaluating </span>an injured <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>to determine <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">he will suffer from this injury </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">he will not suffer, we do not raise a dilemma, </span>since it is obvious <span class="gemarra-regular">that we certainly evaluate </span>this element. <span class="gemarra-regular">When we raise the dilemma </span>of whether the court performs an evaluation or not, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to evaluating an item, </span>i.e., determining <span class="gemarra-regular">if it </span>is capable of <span class="gemarra-regular">causing this damage or </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>capable of causing this damage. With regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta,</span> <span class="it-text">Sanhedrin</span> 12:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaTimni says: Just as a fist is unique </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is submitted to the assembly </span>of judges to assess its ability to injure <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the witnesses </span>who attest that this was the fist used to strike, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>a ruling can be issued in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is submitted to the assembly </span>of judges to identify its ability to injure <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the witnesses </span>who attest that this was the item used to strike. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an evaluation </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they evaluated him </span>as requiring a certain sum for medical costs and loss of livelihood <span class="gemarra-regular">and he healed </span>sooner than expected, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">as they had evaluated him. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this man whom they evaluated, </span>concluding that he would not be able to perform labor <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire day, and </span>his wounds <span class="gemarra-regular">healed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’itpaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at midday and he was performing labor, we give him </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire day. </span>The injury was one that would generally cause a man to not be able to perform labor for an entire day, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it was from Heaven that they had compassion on him </span>and healed him sooner. This does not affect the liability of the one who caused the damage.
§ The mishna teaches (90a): If he <span class="gemarra-regular">spat </span>at him <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">spittle reached him, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he removed </span>another’s cloak, he must give the injured party four hundred dinars. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where the spittle reached <span class="gemarra-regular">him. But </span>if the spittle landed <span class="gemarra-regular">on his clothing </span>without touching him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>required to pay him. The Gemara asks: Why not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it be like </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliated </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with words. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Avin: That is to say </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he humiliated </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">with words </span>alone, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">anything, </span>although he will be held accountable by Heaven for his sin.
The mishna teaches with regard to the assessment of payment for humiliation: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>assessed <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">honor of </span>the one who was humiliated. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency, or </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he say </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as a stringency? </span>The Gemara explains the two possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">He says </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency, </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is a poor </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">who doesn’t need to take so much </span>payment for humiliation, as detailed in the fixed sums of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he says </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as a stringency, </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is a rich </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to give him more </span>than those fixed sums. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor of the Jewish people, they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property </span>and were impoverished, and their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, </span>and are all of prominent lineage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>Rabbi Akiva’s statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that while the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> states the principle that payment for humiliation is in accordance with the honor of the one who was humiliated, and therefore a poor person will receive less than the fixed sums listed in the mishna, Rabbi Akiva responds that even a poor man is deserving of those fixed sums by virtue of his esteemed lineage. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that this is so.
§ The mishna relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving one who uncovered the head of a woman </span>in the marketplace. The woman came before Rabbi Akiva to request that he assess payment for the humiliation that she suffered, and Rabbi Akiva obligated the assailant to give her four hundred dinars. The man said to Rabbi Akiva: My teacher, give me time to pay the penalty, and Rabbi Akiva gave him time. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But do we give time </span>for an assailant to pay compensation? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>to provide payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for injuries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he must pay compensation immediately. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we do not give him time </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation </span>it is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to injury, as he caused a monetary loss </span>by inflicting physical damage on the victim. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to humiliation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where he did not cause him a monetary loss, we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> give </span>him time to pay compensation.
The mishna relates that the man then <span class="gemarra-regular">waited for her </span>until <span class="gemarra-regular">she was standing by the opening of her courtyard, </span>and caused her to uncover her own head. Rabbi Akiva said that although she caused injury to herself, which is not permitted, this does not negate the man’s requirement to pay her compensation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: You plunged into mighty water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and you raised </span>nothing more than worthless <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware in your hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted for a person to injure himself. </span>This contradicts the mishna’s account of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the mishna, where it states that one may not injure himself, it is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>inflicting actual physical <span class="gemarra-regular">injury, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where it states that it is permitted for one to injure himself, it is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation </span>to oneself. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the ruling of Rabbi Akiva in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>causing <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, </span>

Daf 91b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and it teaches: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who injures himself, although it is not permitted for him </span>to do so, he is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from any sort of penalty, indicating that the prohibition is in effect even with regard to humiliation. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the man: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary </span>to say with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">humiliation, where it is permitted for a person to humiliate himself, </span>that someone else who humiliated him is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">But even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">injury</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where it is not permitted for a person to injure himself, others who injured him are liable.</span>
§ The Gemara discusses whether it is permitted to injure oneself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And is a person not permitted to injure himself? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil he will be exempt </span>from bringing an offering for having transgressed this oath. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <span class="gemarra-regular">to do evil or to do good” </span>(Leviticus 5:4), which teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>taking an oath to <span class="gemarra-regular">do good </span>for which one is liable is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an optional </span>activity, as opposed to taking an oath to perform a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>taking an oath to <span class="gemarra-regular">do evil </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">optional </span>activity, as opposed to taking an oath to transgress. <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>can therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>within the category of one who is liable if he transgressed his oath the person who <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath to do evi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to himself and did not do evil</span>. It is clear from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that doing evil to oneself is permitted.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not referring to one who takes an oath to injure himself but is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who takes an oath stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will sit in </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fast, </span>which it is permitted to do. 
Earlier in this same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it states that one who takes an oath to do evil to others is not liable for violating his oath if he does not do evil, as it is prohibited to do evil to others. If the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to one who takes an oath to fast, then <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">in the context of doing evil to others, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must also then be referring to one who takes an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">to have </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">sit in </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fast. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can </span>one compel <span class="gemarra-regular">others </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">sit in </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fast? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes; </span>it is possible, as by preventing others from accessing food he can impose a fast on them, e.g., in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he confined them in a room. </span>
The Gemara questions the assertion that this is the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>considered taking an oath to <span class="gemarra-regular">do evil </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">others? </span>It is considered such if one takes an oath stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will strike so-and-so and I will injure his brain. </span>Accordingly, in the corresponding situation of doing evil to oneself it is necessary to explain that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to causing injury as well, and the inference that this is permitted remains. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as there is </span>a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not permitted for a person to injure himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is </span>a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for a person to injure himself.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that you heard that says: It is not permitted for a person to injure himself? If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And surely your blood of your souls will I require” </span>(Genesis 9:5), and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: From the hand of your souls, </span>i.e., from yourself, <span class="gemarra-regular">will I requir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your blood, </span>meaning one is liable even for taking his own life, that is not a correct inference.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps killing is different. </span>While Rabbi Elazar holds that it is prohibited to take one’s own life, it cannot be inferred from here that he holds that one is liable for injuring himself. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may ren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> garments in anguish <span class="gemarra-regular">over one who died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">of the ways of the Amorites, </span>but a Jewish custom. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: I heard that one who rends </span>his garments <span class="gemarra-regular">excessivel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over one who died is flogged for </span>having transgressed the prohibition of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not destroy </span>(see Deuteronomy 20:19). The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And all the more so </span>it is the case that according to Rabbi Elazar one who injures <span class="gemarra-regular">his body </span>in anguish transgresses this prohibition. 
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps garments are different, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>tearing them <span class="gemarra-regular">is a loss that is irreversible, like that </span>practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who would <span class="gemarra-regular">refer to his garments as: My honor, and </span>like that practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he would walk among thorns and shrubs, </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">raise his clothing </span>despite the fact that his skin would get scratched by the thorns. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span>in explanation of his actions: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>flesh <span class="gemarra-regular">will heal </span>if scratched, <span class="gemarra-regular">but that </span>garment <span class="gemarra-regular">will not heal </span>if torn. Similarly, perhaps it is prohibited to rend one’s garments, but it is permitted to injure oneself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished said: What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to a nazirite: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall atone for him for sinning by the soul” </span>(Numbers 6:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">And with which soul did this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">sin </span>by becoming a nazirite? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he afflicted himself </span>by abstaining <span class="gemarra-regular">from win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> he is considered to have sinned with his own soul, and he must bring a sin-offering for the naziriteship itself, for causing his body to suffer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">matters not </span>inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And just as this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who afflicted himself </span>by abstaining <span class="gemarra-regular">only from wine is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">called a sinner, one who afflicts himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> by abstaining <span class="gemarra-regular">from everything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> through fasting or other acts of mortification, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>is he described as a sinner? Consequently, Rabbi Elazar HaKappar holds that one may not harm himself in any manner.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who cuts </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">saplings, </span>although it is not permitted for him to do so, is exempt from payment. Nevertheless, others who cut down his saplings are liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav:</span> If one charged another: <span class="gemarra-regular">You killed my ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You cut </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">my saplings, </span>and you are liable to pay for them, and the other responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">You told me to kill </span>the ox, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You told me to cut </span>down the saplings, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, you let no creature exist. Is it in his </span>power to assert that because the other instructed him to cause damage he is exempt? With this claim, anyone who causes damage can exempt himself.
Rabba bar bar Ḥana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall I erase this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> from the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> that I teach? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an ox that is ready to be killed, </span>e.g., it had gored, and the owner decided to have it killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a tree that is ready to be cu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> down for whatever reason, e.g., it was worshipped as part of an idolatrous rite or it is situated in a manner that poses a danger to the public. In such a case there is reason to believe that he was in fact instructed to cut it down. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that the owner of the ox or tree acknowledges that it would be killed or cut down in any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">what claim is he stating to him, </span>as there was no loss resulting from the action of the other? The Gemara answers: The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: I desire to perform this mitzva </span>of removing a danger or destroying idolatry by myself, and therefore I am demanding payment from you for having prevented me from doing so.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states with regard to one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall pour </span>out the blood thereof, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall cover </span>it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13). This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who poured </span>the blood, i.e., the one who slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall cove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving one who slaughtered </span>an undomesticated animal or bird, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another preempted </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">and covered </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Gamliel deemed him liable to give ten golden coin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the one who slaughtered the animal, as he prevented him from performing the mitzva. 
§ In connection with the prohibition against cutting down trees the Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree that </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">produces </span>fruit in the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to cut it </span>down due to the prohibition of: “When you shall besiege a city…you shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the statement of Rav from what was taught in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 4:10): <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>fruit must <span class="gemarra-regular">be on an olive tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so </span>that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not cut it </span>down? <span class="gemarra-regular">A quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">kav</span>. Why did Rav say that it must produce a full <span class="it-text">kav</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Olive trees are different, since they are significant. </span>Therefore, even a quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> is valuable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: My son Shivḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not di</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for any reason <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">that he cut </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">a fig tree before its time. Ravina says: But if </span>the lumber <span class="gemarra-regular">was greate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in monetary </span>value than its fruits, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to chop it down, and this does not violate the prohibition against destroying a tree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse states: “Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, them you may destroy and cut down” (Deuteronomy 20:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">“Only the trees of which you know”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree </span>that bears fruit used for <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>and it is permitted to cut down this type of tree under certain circumstances. <span class="gemarra-regular">“That they are not trees for food”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a barren tree. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will ultimately include all types</span> of trees, so that even a tree that produces fruit may be cut down, <span class="gemarra-regular">what, </span>then, is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “That </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not trees for food,” </span>which indicates that it is permitted to cut down only a barren tree? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to give precedence </span>to cutting down <span class="gemarra-regular">a barren </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">over</span> a tree whose fruit is used for <span class="gemarra-regular">food. </span>

Daf 92a

One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that he must give precedence to the cutting down of a barren tree <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the barren tree is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater in monetary </span>value than the fruit-bearing tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: “Only,” </span>which teaches that there is an exception to the rule. Similarly, if the fruit-bearing tree itself would be worth more as lumber than for its fruits, it would be permitted for one to cut it down. 
The Gemara relates: The <span class="gemarra-regular">sharecropper of Shmuel brought him dates. </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">tasted the taste of wine in them. He said to </span>his sharecropper: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this? </span>The sharecropper <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The date palms <span class="gemarra-regular">stand among the grapevines </span>and therefore contain a taste of wine from the grapes. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">they weaken the wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the grapevines, <span class="gemarra-regular">so much </span>that it is possible to taste the wine in the dates? <span class="gemarra-regular">Tomorrow, </span>cut down the date palms and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring me from their marro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> to eat. 
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda saw date palms </span>growing <span class="gemarra-regular">among grapevines </span>on his estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to his sharecropper: Uproot the </span>date palms, since one can <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase date palms </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevines</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as grapevines are more valuable, while one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot purchase grapevines </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">date palms. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Despite </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the assailant who caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">gives to </span>the victim all of the required payments for the injury, his transgression is <span class="gemarra-regular">not forgiven for him </span>in the heavenly court <span class="gemarra-regular">until he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">request</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> forgiveness <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>that God told Abimelech after he had taken Sarah from Abraham: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Now therefore restore the wife </span>of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live” (Genesis 20:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where</span> is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forgiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">him that he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cruel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, </span>and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17).
The mishna continues: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Blind my eye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">cut off my hand, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">break my leg, </span>and he does so, the one who performed these actions is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage, despite having been instructed to do so. Even if he explicitly instructed him: Do so <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>you will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment, he is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
With regard to one who says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Tear my garment, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">break my jug, </span>and he does so, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage. But if he instructed him explicitly: Do so <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>you will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment. If one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do so, </span>i.e., cause damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">to so-and-s</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the condition that </span>you will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment, and he did so, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, whether </span>the instructions were <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">himself, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the instructions were <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his property. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: All these </span>sums <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in the previous mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>one is liable to pay for humiliating another are the <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for his humiliation, </span>for which there is a set amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for the victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> caused by the assailant, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>as offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">all the rams of Nebaioth </span>(see Isaiah 60:7) <span class="gemarra-regular">that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the world, </span>which are of the best quality, his transgression <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forgiven for him </span>in the heavenly court <span class="gemarra-regular">until he requests </span>forgiveness <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Restore the wife of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you”</span> (Genesis 20:7).
Having quoted the verse, the Gemara asks: Shall one infer from here <span class="gemarra-regular">that the wife of a prophet needs to be returned, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the wife of another </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">need not be returned? </span>
The Gemara answers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan says: </span>This is how the verse should be understood: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Restore the wife of the man” in any case, </span>since she is his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you, </span>Abimelech, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: “Will you slay even a righteous nation? Did he not say himself to me: She is my sister, and she, even she herself, said: He is my brother?” </span>(Genesis 20:4–5), the answer is that you, Abimelech, are not so righteous, since the reason Abraham said that Sarah was his sister is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a prophet, and he already learne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> how to conduct himself based on your behavior. As with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a guest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhsenai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who comes to town, does one ask him about matters concerning eating and drinking, or does one ask him about matters concerning his wife? </span>Does one ask a guest: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is she your wife? Is she your sister? </span>Abimelech was to be blamed, since Abraham thought that he intended to steal his wife.
The Gemara remarks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is executed </span>for having transgressed a prohibition without awareness that the act was prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he should have learne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he did not learn.</span>
Having mentioned the verses concerning the incident of Abraham and Abimelech, the Gemara explains other related verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">“For the Lord had obstructe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atzor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">atzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>all the wombs of the house of Abimelech” (Genesis 20:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Why </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">these two obstructions [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atzor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">atzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>both stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a man, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">semen </span>will not be discharged, and <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a woman, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">semen </span>will not be discharged from her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that she will not give <span class="gemarra-regular">birth.</span>
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Two </span>are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a man: Semen and urine, </span>i.e., that the men were unable to both urinate and discharge semen; <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a woman: Semen, and urine, and birth.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: Three </span>are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a man: Semen, and urine, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">anal sphincter, </span>i.e., that they were unable to discharge stool as well. Consequently, they would be unable to relieve themselves at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Four </span>are stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a woman: Semen, and birth, and urine, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">anal sphincter.</span>
The verse states: “For the Lord had obstructed <span class="gemarra-regular">all the wombs</span> of the house of Abimelech.” The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yannai say: Even a hen of the house of Abimelech did not lay her egg </span>during that time.
§ The Gemara cites a series of questions that Rava asked Rabba bar Mari, the first one being related to the previous topic of discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages stated: Anyone who asks </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">compassion </span>from Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">another, and he requires </span>compassion from Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning that same matter, he is answered first? </span>Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” </span>(Job 42:10).
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You said </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from a verse in the Writings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants, </span>and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>immediately following that: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said” </span>(Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Abraham sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to Abimelech. </span>Because Abraham prayed for Abimelech that the women of his household should give birth, Abraham himself was answered concerning that matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The cabbage is damaged together with the thorn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the cabbage is sometimes harmed when the thorn is removed? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord” </span>(Jeremiah 2:29). The term “you all” includes even those who have not sinned.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You said </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from a verse in the Prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from a verse in the Torah. The Lord said to Moses after some of the people collected the manna on Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">“How long do you refuse [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’antem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to keep My commandments and My laws?” </span>(Exodus 16:28). The term “you refuse [<span class="it-text">me’antem</span>]” is written in the plural, indicating that even Moses was included, although he did not sin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written </span>with regard to Joseph: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And from among his brothers he took five men, </span>and presented them to Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are these fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> men? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Those whose names were repeate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the blessings with which Moses later blessed the twelve tribes. They are Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali (see Deuteronomy 35). Since they were weak, Joseph brought them before Pharaoh. 
Rava said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah also </span>had his name <span class="gemarra-regular">repeated </span>in the blessings, and he was strong.
Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: His </span>name <span class="gemarra-regular">was repeated for his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written </span>concerning Reuben and Judah in Moses’ blessing of the tribes at the end of his life: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let Reuben live and not die in that his men become few” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:6), and immediately afterward in the following verse it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And this for Judah, </span>and he said: Hear Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; may his hands fight on his behalf, and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7)? What is the connection between the blessing of Reuben and that of Judah, juxtaposed with the conjunction “and”?
Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <span class="gemarra-regular">All those forty years that the Jewish people were in the desert, the bones of Judah, </span>which the Jewish people took with them from Egypt along with the bones of his brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">were rollin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> around <span class="gemarra-regular">in the coffin, until Moses came and asked for mercy </span>on Judah’s behalf. Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">said before </span>God: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of the Universe, who </span>served as the <span class="gemarra-regular">impetus for Reuben that he should confess </span>his sin, through which he merited a blessing and was not excluded from the count of the twelve sons of Jacob (see Genesis 35:22)? It was <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah, </span>as Reuben saw him confess his sin, and thereby did the same. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately </span>after Moses prayed, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">His bones </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">entered </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">sockets [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leshafa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and his skeleton became attached. The angels still <span class="gemarra-regular">did not elevate </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">into the heavenly study hall. </span>Moses then prayed: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And bring him in unto his people”</span> (Deuteronomy 33:7), i.e., bring him to those in the heavenly study hall. This prayer was accepted, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">did not kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what the sages were saying, and </span>he was unable <span class="gemarra-regular">to deliberate </span>in Torah matters <span class="gemarra-regular">with the sages. </span>Moses then prayed: <span class="gemarra-regular">“May his hands fight on his behalf” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:7), meaning that he should have the ability to contend with them in study. But still <span class="gemarra-regular">he was unable to draw </span>conclusions from <span class="gemarra-regular">his discussion in accordance with the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Moses then prayed: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And You shall be a help against his adversaries” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:7).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Poverty follows the poor? </span>Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> 3:8): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rich </span>people would <span class="gemarra-regular">bring first fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in baskets of gold and of silver, and poor </span>people would bring first fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">in wicker baskets </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of peeled willow, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they would give the baskets and the first fruits to the priests. </span>The rich would have their baskets returned to them, while the poor would not. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You said </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from a mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from a verse in the Torah: 

Daf 92b

The verse states with regard to one diagnosed with leprosy: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall cry: Unclean, unclean” </span>(Leviticus 13:45). Not only must the leper suffer from the leprosy itself; he must undergo further embarrassment by publicizing his condition. This is akin to the aphorism that poverty follows the poor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby the Sages stated: Awaken early and eat, in the summer due to the heat and in the winter due to the cold. And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">people say: Sixty runners run and do not reach the man who ate in the morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them” </span>(Isaiah 49:10), indicating that one who is not hungry or thirsty will not be affected by the weather. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You said </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from a verse in the Prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from a verse in the Torah. The verse states: “And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you” (Exodus 23:25). Rava explicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall serve the Lord your God”; this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">recitation of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and prayer. “And He will bless your bread and your water”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>dipped <span class="gemarra-regular">in salt, and a flask of water </span>drunk after the bread, in the mornings. <span class="gemarra-regular">From this</span> point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward </span>the remainder of the verse applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Sickness”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">bile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And why is its name called sickness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maḥala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>It is called this <span class="gemarra-regular">since there are eighty-three sicknesses in </span>bile. The letters spelling the word <span class="gemarra-italic">maḥala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., <span class="it-text">mem</span>, <span class="it-text">ḥet</span>, <span class="it-text">lamed</span>, <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">have that numerical value </span>of eighty-three. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of those </span>sicknesses, eating <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>dipped <span class="gemarra-regular">in salt </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning and </span>drinking <span class="gemarra-regular">a flask of water </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">negates them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby the Sages stated: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">your friend calls you a donkey, prepare a saddle for your back</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., do not contest his statement? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the conversation between the angel and Hagar: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he said: Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from where did you come and to where are you going? And she said: I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai” </span>(Genesis 16:8). Though Hagar was no longer the maidservant of Sarai, since the angel referred to her as such, she responded in kind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: </span>If you are aware of <span class="gemarra-regular">a derogatory matter that is </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">in you, say it first </span>before others say it about you? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to Eliezer: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he said: I am Abraham’s servant”</span> (Genesis 24:34), immediately proclaiming that he is a servant. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: The goose stoops </span>its head <span class="gemarra-regular">as it goe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> along, <span class="gemarra-regular">but its eyes </span>look <span class="gemarra-regular">afar</span> to find food for itself? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to Abigail’s statement to David: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant” </span>(I Samuel 25:31). Although Abigail spoke with humility in her request that David spare her husband’s life, she made reference to deriving future benefit from David. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: Sixty discomforts come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the teeth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekhakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who hears the sound of another </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to what Nathan the prophet said concerning the coronation banquet of Adonijah, to which he was not invited: “For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons…<span class="gemarra-regular">But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not called” </span>(I Kings 1:25–26).
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You said </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from a verse in the Prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I say </span>the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted for his mother” </span>(Genesis 24:67). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward: “And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah” </span>(Genesis 25:1). After seeing his son marry, Abraham was disquieted by the fact he was not married. This is akin to one who sees another eating and does not eat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: </span>While <span class="gemarra-regular">the wine </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner, the gratitude </span>is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who pours it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to God commanding Moses to transfer his authority to Joshua: “And the Lord said unto Moses: Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and lay your hand upon him…that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken” </span>(Numbers 27:18–20). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, </span>and did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:9). Although the spirit of God was not given to Joshua by Moses, as Moses was only a conduit, he was given credit for it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: A dog, in its hunger, swallows </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">dung</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet” </span>(Proverbs 27:7).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: A bad palm tree strolls and goes </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among a grove of barren trees, </span>i.e., bad people seek out other bad people? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This matter is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, and triplicated in the Writings, and we learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a mishna, and we learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael” </span>(Genesis 28:9). It <span class="gemarra-regular">is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him” </span>(Judges 11:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him </span>(Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a mishna </span>(<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 12:2): <span class="gemarra-regular">All that is attached to </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all that is attached to </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure. And we learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught </span>did the <span class="gemarra-regular">starling go to the rave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but because it is its kind, </span>as it too is a non-kosher bird. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">you called </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">your frien</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he did not answer you, throw a large wall </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cast it at him, </span>i.e., do not attempt to help him anymore? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Because I have purged you and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your impurity anymore, </span>until I have satisfied My fury upon you” (Ezekiel 24:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a well that you drank from, do not throw a stone into it? </span>Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land” </span>(Deuteronomy 23:8). Since you dwelled in their lands, you may not cause them harm. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: If you lift the load </span>with me <span class="gemarra-regular">I will lift </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>you will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>lift it with me <span class="gemarra-regular">I won’t lift </span>it? Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to Barak and Deborah concerning the war of Sisera: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Barak said to her: If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go” </span>(Judges 4:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: When we were small, </span>we were considered <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">men; now that we are old, </span>we are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">children [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ledardekei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is that <span class="gemarra-regular">initially, it is written </span>with regard to the Jewish people traveling in the wilderness: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light” </span>(Exodus 13:21). God Himself guarded over the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">But at the end, </span>after some time passed and it would be expected that the Jewish people were considered more important, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: </span>

Daf 93a

<span class="gemarra-regular"> “Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way” </span>(Exodus 23:20), indicating that an angel was sent in place of God to guard the Jewish people. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">whereby people say: Drag woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after a property owner. </span>In other words, help out a wealthy man even in a small way, as this may lead to your benefiting from him. Rabba bar Mari <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents” </span>(Genesis 13:5).
§ In connection with the incident of Abraham and Abimelech mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara quotes a related statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanan says: One who passes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment of anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you, </span>I gave my handmaid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: The Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her” </span>(Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter applies </span>only in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has </span>someone to do <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">on eart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court.
Concerning this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Woe to he who cries </span>out to Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">more than the one about whom </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">crying </span>out. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>concept <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Both the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who crie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> out <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one about whom </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">crying </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">are included </span>in the verse discussing the cries of an orphan who is mistreated: “If you afflict them, for if they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry. My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword” (Exodus 22:22–23). <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are quicker </span>to punish <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who cries </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">than the one about whom </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">crying </span>out, as in the incident with Sarai. 
The Gemara provides another lesson from the story of Abraham and Abimelech. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The curse of an ordinary person should never be </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah and it was fulfilled in her descendant. </span>The curse on Sarah is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes” </span>(Genesis 20:16), meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her: Since you concealed </span>your status <span class="gemarra-regular">from me and you did not reveal that </span>Abraham <span class="gemarra-regular">is your husband, and you caused me this suffering, may it be </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will that you should have children with covered eyes. And </span>this curse <span class="gemarra-regular">was fulfilled in her descendant, as it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see” </span>(Genesis 27:1). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu says: A person should always be among those who are pursue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and not among the pursuers. </span>One can prove that this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as none among birds are pursue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more than doves and pigeons, </span>as all predators hunt them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from all birds <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse deemed them fit to</span> be sacrificed on the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar. </span>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Blind my eye, </span>or: Cut off my hand, or: Break my leg, and he does so, the latter is liable to pay for the damage, even if the injured party explicitly instructed him to do so on the condition that he will be exempt from payment. But if one instructs another to damage his property on the condition that he will be exempt from payment, he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi bar Ḥama said to Rava: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause and what is different</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause? </span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>he is liable, despite the fact that he was instructed to carry out the injury on the condition that he would be exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person does not forgo </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage to his <span class="gemarra-regular">extremitie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> such as his eyes, hands, and feet, mentioned in the mishna (92a). Consequently, when he told the assailant that he would be exempt, the presumption is that he was not sincere. 
Rav Asi bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But does a person forgo </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for his pain </span>when he doesn’t lose a limb? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Strike me, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">wound me, on the condition that </span>you will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>According to Rava’s reasoning, he should be liable in this case as well, as the presumption should be that he was not sincere. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent, </span>as he did not have a response. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have you heard anything with regard to this </span>matter? Rav Asi bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what Rav Sheshet said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>loss of a limb may result in <span class="gemarra-regular">a family flaw, </span>i.e., it may cause harm to the family name. One who loses a limb not only suffers pain; his family suffers as well. He is not in a position to forgive the assailant for the harm caused to his family, but he may forgo compensation for his own pain. Consequently, if he instructed another merely to injure him, without causing loss of limb, on condition that the assailant will be exempt from payment, the assailant will be exempt. 
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed concerning the explanation for the ruling of the first clause of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>loss of a limb may result in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">family flaw. Rava says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person does not forgo </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage to <span class="gemarra-regular">his extremities.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is a yes that, </span>based on other factors, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like a no </span>and is not viewed as giving consent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a no that, </span>based on other factors, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like a yes, </span>and although one said no it is as though he gave consent. In this case as well, where he said: On condition to be exempt, he was not sincere. 
The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. With regard to one who said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Strike me, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">wound me; </span>and the other asks: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>I will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the first one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him, </span>in the tone of a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>this is an example of the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is a yes that is like a no. </span>It is as if the victim asked: Even if I give you permission to do it, do you think that I would forgo the compensation? By contrast, if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Tear my garment, </span>and the other asks: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>I will <span class="gemarra-regular">be exempt </span>from payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to him, </span>in the tone of a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, this </span>is an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a no that is like a yes, </span>since he meant to say that if he did not want to exempt him from payment he would not ask him to do it. 
§ The mishna teaches that if one instructed another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Break my jug, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Tear my garment, </span>and the other did so, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verses state with regard to bailees: “If a man delivers to his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard” (Exodus 22:6), and: “If a man delivers to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to safeguard” (Exodus 22:9). The Sages derived from these verses that the bailee is liable if the item was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to safeguard, but not </span>where it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to destroy; </span>if it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to safeguard, but not </span>where it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to tear; </span>if it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to safeguard, but not </span>where it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to distribute to the poor. </span>This indicates that a bailee is not liable for damage to an item if he was told to tear it, even if the owner did not state that it is on condition to be exempt.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna that obligates him to pay for the damage is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it came into his possession, </span>and he was responsible for it before the owner instructed him to tear it. Therefore, even if he was instructed to tear it, he is liable. And <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which exempts him from paying, is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it did not come into his possession, </span>but he simply tore it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to </span>Rav Huna: But the phrase in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“to safeguard,” </span>which obligates a bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates that it came into his possession </span>already, and this is the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that rules he is exempt. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba said: This and that </span>are discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it came into his possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it came into his possession as </span>an item given for <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarding, </span>and he is exempt if the owner stated explicitly that this will be the case, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it came into his possession as </span>an item given for <span class="gemarra-regular">tearing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain purse </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> charity </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">that came to </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pumbedita. Rav Yosef deposited i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a certain man. </span>That man <span class="gemarra-regular">was negligent in </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">thieves came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">stole it. Rav Yosef deemed </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay compensation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">To safeguard, but not </span>where it was given to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to distribute to the poor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This seems to teach that with regard to money that is distributed to the poor, there is no <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of safeguarding.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The poor of Pumbedita </span>have an amount that is <span class="gemarra-regular">set for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to receive. Each poor person already had a specific sum designated for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>accordingly <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in the category of: <span class="gemarra-regular">To safeguard. </span>Therefore, he is liable.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fashions it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, </span>or one who robs another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and fashions it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value of the goods at the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of the robbery, </span>but he need not return the vessels or garments. He has acquired the stolen items because they had undergone a change.
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant cow and it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth </span>while in his possession, or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ewe </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">laden </span>with wool <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the robber then <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared it, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of a cow that is ready to give birt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of a ewe that is ready to be shorn. </span>He pays the value of the animal at the time of the robbery, and the calf or the wool remains his.
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow, and it became pregnant in his </span>possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth; </span>or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ewe, and it became laden </span>with wool <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared it, </span>then the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays according to </span>the value of the animal at the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of the robbery. This is the principle: All robbers pay according to </span>the value of the stolen item at the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of the robbery.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It can be inferred from the mishna that if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and fashioned it into vessels, yes, </span>the robber acquires the wood due to the change. If he merely <span class="gemarra-regular">sanded it, no, </span>the robber does not acquire it, as this is not a significant change. Similarly, if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and fashioned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, yes, </span>he has acquired the wool due to the change. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">washed it, no, </span>he has not acquired it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and sanded it, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">stones and smoothed them, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and washed it, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">flax and cleaned it, he pays according to </span>the value of the stolen item at the <span class="gemarra-regular">time of the robbery. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that even a change such as sanding wood is regarded as a significant change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This does not contradict the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law, which is not deemed significant by Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is reversible. And all the more so, </span>if the robber effects <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law, i.e., an irreversible change, he acquires the stolen item due to the change.
The Gemara explains: Accordingly, it must be that the case in the mishna, where the change is reversible, where one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and fashioned it into vessels, </span>is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanded wood. And what are they? Boards </span>that the robber used to construct a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is a change </span>in which the item <span class="gemarra-regular">can revert to its original state, as, if </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">desires, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">disassemble them. </span>Similarly, the case of one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and fashioned it into garments </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to wool </span>that was already <span class="gemarra-regular">spun, as </span>fashioning them into garments <span class="gemarra-regular">is a change </span>in which the item <span class="gemarra-regular">can revert to its original state, as, if </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">desires, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">unravel them. </span>The mishna teaches that the robber acquires the stolen item by making these changes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all the more so </span>the robber acquires the stolen item through <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law.</span>
Abaye continues his explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he does not teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law. </span>It is possible that he maintains that the robber does not acquire the stolen item due to such a change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi stated </span>another answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also teaching </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>deemed significant <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law. </span>The case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and fashioned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>is referring to one who constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">pestles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bukhanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>analogous to the case mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> where <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanded them,</span> since a pestle is formed by trimming the wood in an irreversible manner. Similarly, the case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and fashioned it into garments </span>is referring to one who fashioned the wool into pieces of <span class="gemarra-regular">felt [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">namtei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is an irreversible change.</span>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does washing </span>effect a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">change, </span>so that one who robs another of wool and washes it acquires the wool and pays its value at the time of robbery? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna that discusses the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the first of the sheared wool, which one must give to a priest (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 135a): If the owner of the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">did not manage to giv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the sheared wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">before he dyed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from giving it to the priest, as the obligation is in effect only with regard to wool remaining in its original state. By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he washed it but did not dye it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to give it to the priest. This indicates that washing does not effect a significant change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the first of the sheared wool: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared it, spun it, and wove it, </span>the sheared wool <span class="gemarra-regular">does not combin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with the wool from other sheep to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">washed it, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not combine </span>with the wool of other sheep, as washing effects a significant change, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">combines </span>with the wool of other sheep, as washing does not effect a significant change. Their opinions correspond to the opinions in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and mishna previously quoted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava stated </span>another answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">This and that, </span>i.e., both the mishna and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one untangled </span>the strands of wool by hand before washing it. In this case, the washing is not fully effective, and does not effect a significant change. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one combed it </span>before washing it. The washing is more effective and consequently effects a significant change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>another answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one merely <span class="gemarra-regular">whitened it, </span>which is not a significant change. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one bleached i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with sulfur, which is a significant change.
Having demonstrated that, according to Rabbi Shimon, washing effects a significant change, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be said </span>that, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Shimon, dye does not </span>effect a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">change, </span>as the Gemara will prove, can it be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">washing </span>effects a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">change? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one and dyed </span>the wool of each sheep before shearing the next sheep, or sheared them <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one and spun </span>the wool, or sheared them <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one and wove </span>the wool, then the wool sheared from the different sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">does not combine </span>to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: </span>Even if he <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed it, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">combines </span>with the other wool. This indicates that, according to Rabbi Shimon, even dyeing the wool is not a significant change, so how could he maintain that washing it is?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement, that washed wool does not combine with other wool, is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement, that even dyed wool combines with other wool, is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon. </span>There is a dispute as to what Rabbi Shimon rules with regard to this issue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, the Rabbis do not disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, </span>and they are also of the opinion that Rabbi Shimon holds that washing effects a significant change. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the apparent contradiction, <span class="gemarra-regular">dye is differen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and it does not effect a significant change, <span class="gemarra-regular">since one is able to remove it with soap [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzafon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and return the wool to its previous state. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when it is taught there, </span>in the mishna cited above, that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one did not manage to give </span>the sheared wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">before he dyed it he is exempt, and </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was established in accordance with all opinions, </span>it was not stated with regard to ordinary dye but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> indigo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which cannot be removed </span>with soap and therefore effects a permanent and therefore significant change.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, and Beit Shammai, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, and Rabbi Yishmael all hold </span>that despite <span class="gemarra-regular">a change, </span>the changed item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place, </span>i.e., the changed item is still considered to have the status it had before the change. The Gemara proceeds to prove that each of these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> holds this way: The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">said. </span>He says that, according to Rabbi Shimon, even if the wool is dyed it still combines with the wool of other animals to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source that indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span> maintain that an item that undergoes a change is considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>a prostitute <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat as her payment, and she </span>ground it and <span class="gemarra-regular">converted it into flour; </span>or if he gave her <span class="gemarra-regular">olives, and she </span>squeezed them and <span class="gemarra-regular">converted them into oil; </span>or if he gave her <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes, and she </span>squeezed them and <span class="gemarra-regular">converted them into wine; </span>and if, in any of these cases, she subsequently consecrated the final product, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to sacrifice them upon the altar as a meal-offering or libation, as the Torah states: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as the Gemara will explain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef says: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">Guryon</span>

Daf 94a

<span class="gemarra-regular">of Asporak: Beit Shammai prohibit </span>sacrificing these items <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>doing so. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of Beit Shammai? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of the Lord your God for any vow; for <span class="gemarra-regular">even both of these </span>are an abomination unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The word “even” is an amplification, which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>in the prohibition these items in <span class="gemarra-regular">their changed </span>form. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is the reason of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel? The verse states “these” </span>to emphasize that the prohibition applies only to these items in their initial form, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">their changed </span>form.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, isn’t </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“these” written </span>in the verse, indicating an exclusion? The Gemara responds: Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">requires that </span>word to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">“these” </span>items are forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offspring </span>of animals given as payment to the prostitute. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>what is the source of that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: According to Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">you learn two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from this</span> word, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“These” </span>items are forbidden in their initial form <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">their changed </span>form, and <span class="gemarra-regular">“these” </span>items are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">but not their offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel as well, isn’t </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“even” written </span>in the verse, indicating an amplification? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“even” is difficult for Beit Hillel. </span>It is not clear how they would interpret that word.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source that indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span>holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>In the case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">ground it, kneaded it, and baked it, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">separate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it, </span>i.e., he separated the portion of the dough that one is required to separate and then give to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>can he <span class="gemarra-regular">recite the blessing </span>over the separation of <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>individual is <span class="gemarra-regular">not reciting a blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">blaspheming</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And with regard to this it is stated: “The robber who recites a blessing blasphemes the Lord” </span>(Psalms 10:3), which is referring to a robber who recites a blessing upon performing a mitzva with an item he stole. According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, although this wheat has been significantly changed, it is still considered a stolen item.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source that indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar </span>holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:2) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated this principle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any enhancement </span>to the stolen animal in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was enhanced </span>by the actions of the <span class="gemarra-regular">robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has the advantage </span>when repaying the owner. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he desires, he takes his enhancement, </span>i.e., when he returns the animal, the robbery victim must pay the difference between its value at the time of the robbery and its current value, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he desires </span>he can return it to the owner and <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: That which is yours is before you.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he saying? </span>If the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement to the animal, why would he ever return it without stating this demand? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced it, he takes his enhancement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">weakened, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: That which is yours is before you, </span>and no further compensation is required. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>despite <span class="gemarra-regular">a change, </span>the changed item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place. </span>Since the robber has not acquired it, he simply returns the item to the robbery victim.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>i.e., if the robber has not acquired it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he enhanced it </span>that should be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>The item should still belong to the robbery victim and the robber should not be entitled to compensation. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: The fact that the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to an ordinance </span>instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the penitent. </span>In order to ease the burden of one who desires to repent, the Sages instituted that the robber be reimbursed for the increase in the value of the animal. Otherwise, a robber might refrain from returning a stolen item.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source that indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael </span>holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The ideal way to fulfill the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva of produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">e’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to separat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the standing </span>grain, i.e., grain that has not been harvested. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one did not separate </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the standing </span>grain, he <span class="gemarra-regular">separates </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sheaves </span>of grain that have already been harvested. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not separate </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sheaves, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">separates </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the pile </span>of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">smoothed </span>the pile.
If he <span class="gemarra-regular">smoothed </span>the pile of grain, activating the obligation to tithe the produce, he first <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes </span>the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>a portion of the tithed produce <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the poor as <span class="it-text">pe’a</span>, so that the poor will not have to tithe what they receive. Additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: </span>If he did not separate <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> during any of the aforementioned stages and he made a dough from the grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he separates </span><span class="it-text">pe’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the doug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gives it to </span>the poor. This indicates that even if the grain was changed, one is not exempt from the obligation of <span class="it-text">pe’a</span>.
The Gemara has now clarified the sources Abaye alluded to when he listed all the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> who hold that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Did all these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> go to </span>so much trouble in <span class="gemarra-regular">an effort [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ikhpal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to teach us </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>which is presumably not accepted as normative? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Pappa: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what they are saying: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not engage in a dispute with regard to this matter. </span>All of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> hold that even Beit Hillel agree that a change in the form of an item does not impact its status.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From where </span>can it be proven that all of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> hold that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? One can say that the reasons for their statements are due to other factors. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda states </span>his opinion, that it is not a significant change, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the first of the sheared wool, <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to dye, </span>which is a reversible change, <span class="gemarra-regular">since one is able to remove it with soap.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai state </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of a harlot, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Most High, because </span>of the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">has become repugnant,</span> in being used as payment for the services of a prostitute, and therefore it cannot be used for an offering even if its form has changed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where one robbed another of wheat, <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to a blessing, because this is a mitzva </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is performed through </span>commission of <span class="gemarra-regular">a transgression, </span>but this does not indicate that a change is insignificant with regard to other matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where the condition of the animal changed, <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to weakening </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is reversible. </span>Since the animal’s value can be restored by fattening it, the weakening is not deemed a significant change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where one separated <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> at a late stage, <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because it is written: “You shall leave </span>them for the poor” <span class="gemarra-regular">an additional </span>time. It is mentioned twice, in Leviticus 19:10 and Leviticus 23:22. One of these terms is superfluous, indicating that <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> must be given to the poor under all circumstances, even if the grain was changed and made into dough. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: Let us derive from </span><span class="it-text">pe’a</span> that in other halakhic domains the status of an item is not affected by its undergoing a change, <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> cannot function as a source because <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts to the poor are different </span>from other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>.
The Gemara notes: Rava’s claim that no definitive conclusion with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael concerning a changed item is supported by the statement of another <span class="it-text">amora</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the dilemma raised by Rabbi Yonatan, as Rabbi Yonatan raises a dilemma: What is the reason </span>for the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yishmael? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">change does not </span>cause one to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>an item? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he generally holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">change </span>does cause one to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>an item, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here,</span> in the case of <span class="it-text">pe’a</span>, it is different <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall leave” is written an additional </span>time.
Having quoted Rabbi Yonatan’s dilemma, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yishmael is that he holds that change does not </span>cause one to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>an item, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall leave,” which the Merciful One writes </span>in the Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> may not be taken from dough, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">the additional </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall leave” that the Merciful One writes?</span>
The Gemara responds: This additional term <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who renounced ownership of his vineyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and arose earl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the morning </span>before anyone else took possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">and harvested it is obligated in</span> the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">individual fallen </span>grapes left for the poor <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">p</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">incompletely formed clusters </span>of grapes left for the poor <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">olelot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>clusters of grapes left for the poor <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> These are the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he is exempt from the </span>mitzva to <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. The obligation to give gifts to the poor in this case is derived from the additional mention of the term “You shall leave.”
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of a stolen item that underwent a change. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</span> who says that even if the stolen animal deteriorated, it is returned to the owner in its current state.
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Shmuel say: One does not appraise </span>the change in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for a thief nor for a robber. Rather, </span>they keep the stolen animal and pay back the victim with their own money; one appraises the change only for one obligated to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, who said </span>earlier in response to Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>he stated it only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to weakening </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is reversible, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: When </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, </span>who holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>despite <span class="gemarra-regular">a change, </span>the changed item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place, </span>he stated this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to weakening </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">which is reversible, </span>in which case the change is insignificant. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when Shmuel says there: One does not appraise </span>the change in value, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for a thief nor for a robber, </span>but rather one appraises the change <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>for one obligated to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">for damage, </span>he stated this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to weakening </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is irreversible.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Abaye, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states </span>his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">he states it </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to weakening </span>of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">which is irreversible, what can be said?</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye taught </span>the statement of Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">like this: Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>

Daf 94b

Some <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, but </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">himself does not hold accordingly.</span>
The Gemara continues the discussion of acquisition of a stolen item due to a change it underwent. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, a stolen item that has changed is returned as is, as it is stated: “And he shall restore that which he took by robbery” </span>(Leviticus 5:23). This indicates that he shall return it <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>even if it has been changed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna </span>it is stated that if the stolen item is changed the robber gives monetary compensation rather than returning the item, that policy was instituted by the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the ordinance </span>instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">for the penitent.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned </span>in a mishna with regard to first of the sheared wool (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 135a): If the owner of the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">did not manage to give </span>the sheared wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">before he dyed it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from giving it to the priest. This indicates that dyeing the wool is a significant change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One of the Rabbis, whose name </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov, said to them: It was explained to me </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>that he was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanded wood and fashioned it into vessels, which is a change </span>in which the item <span class="gemarra-regular">can revert to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its original state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, the robber does not acquire the item by Torah law, but rather due to the ordinance instituted for the penitent.
§ Having mentioned the ordinance instituted for the penitent, the Gemara discusses other details of this ordinance. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 8:11): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers or usurer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that returned </span>either the stolen item or the interest to the one from whom they took it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who does accept</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, the Sages are displeased with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since by doing so he discourages those who wish to repent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This mishna, </span>i.e., the statement of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in the days of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident with regard to one man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who desired to repent </span>after having been a thief for many years. <span class="gemarra-regular">His wife said to him: Empty one [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">reika</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you repent </span>you will have to return all the stolen items to their rightful owners, and <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt </span>that you are wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">is not yours, and he refrained and did not repent. At that time, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers or usurers that returned </span>either the stolen item or the interest to the one from whom they took it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. And </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">one who does accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, the Sages are displeased with him.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objectio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to children whose deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">father left the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money </span>paid <span class="gemarra-regular">as interest, although they know that it is interest, they are not obligated to return </span>it. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They,</span> the children, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>the ones <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not </span>obligated to return it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but their father </span>would have been <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to return </span>it, and his victims may accept his money.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">By right, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should have taught <span class="gemarra-regular">that their father also </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have been <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to return </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span> this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the children is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>of the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to teach </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">father left them a cow, or a garment, or any </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">specific item </span>he had stolen or taken as interest, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are obligated to return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the honor of their father, </span>so that the item not serve as a reminder to all that their father transgressed. Since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> needs to be stated specifically with regard to the children, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught with regard to them.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the honor of their father they are obligated to return </span>the item or money? <span class="gemarra-regular">I will read here </span>the verse: “You shall not revile God, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor curse a ruler of your people” </span>(Exodus 22:27), from which the Sages inferred that the prohibition against cursing a ruler is in effect only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a ruler that <span class="gemarra-regular">acts as </span>a member of <span class="gemarra-regular">your people, </span>i.e., in accordance with Torah law. One who curses a wicked ruler does not violate this prohibition. Similarly, if one’s father is wicked, the mitzva to honor him should not apply. Why would his children have to return items that he stole due to his honor?
The Gemara responds: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pineḥas said </span>concerning a different case: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he repented. Here too, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">repented, </span>and since he is no longer wicked, his children are obligated to honor him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he repented, what was </span>the stolen item or interest <span class="gemarra-regular">doing with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He should have returned it </span>while he was still alive. The Gemara responds: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not manage to return it before he died. </span>Consequently, the children must return the items in order to uphold their father’s honor.
The Gemara raises another contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the statement of another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers and usurers, although they collected </span>the stolen item or interest, <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it.
The Gemara first clarifies the meaning of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers, what collection is there, </span>i.e., why did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> use the term: Collected, in this context? <span class="gemarra-regular">If they robbed, they robbed </span>and did not collect anything; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if they did not rob, they did not rob </span>and cannot be called robbers at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>emend the text of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers, and who are they, </span>i.e., what is meant by the term: Robbers? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">usurers. </span>The Gemara resumes its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although they collected </span>the interest, <span class="gemarra-regular">they must return </span>it. This is contrary to the ruling of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that if robbers and usurers return what they have taken, it is not accepted. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one does not accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why do they return </span>it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <span class="gemarra-regular">to fulfill </span>their obligation to <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In order to fully repent, they must at least offer to return to the debtors the interest they took unlawfully.
The Gemara raises a contradiction from another source. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the statement of another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherds </span>who allow their animals to graze in other people’s fields, thereby stealing from the owners; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>tax <span class="gemarra-regular">collector</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who are hired to collect taxes on behalf of the government and collect excessive sums; <span class="gemarra-regular">or tax collector</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who purchase the right to collect taxes themselves and collect unlawfully, <span class="gemarra-regular">their repentance is difficult, </span>since they steal from the public. It is difficult for them to find every one of their victims in order to pay them restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>what they have stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">to whomever they recognize </span>as victims of their theft. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that thieves do return what they have stolen.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they return </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one does not accept </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why do they return </span>it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <span class="gemarra-regular">to fulfill </span>their obligation to <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if they are not actually obligated to return what they have stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is their repentance difficult?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the money belonging to those <span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not recognize </span>as their victims, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should use </span>that money for <span class="gemarra-regular">community needs. And Rav Ḥisda says: </span>This means providing <span class="gemarra-regular">pits, ditches, and caves, </span>which benefit the general public. This indicates that a thief actually does pay back what he has stolen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this contradiction must be resolved differently. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that he must actually return what he has stolen, it is referring to a time <span class="gemarra-regular">before the ordinance </span>for the penitent was instituted. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that one does not accept the repayment from a robber, it is referring to a time <span class="gemarra-regular">after the ordinance </span>was instituted.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that Rav Naḥman says </span>that when the Sages say that he does not return what he has stolen, they refer only to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the stolen item does not exist </span>in its initial form, and <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that, </span>both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, are referring to a time <span class="gemarra-regular">after the ordinance </span>was instituted, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>

Daf 95a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that rules that one may accept the stolen item is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the stolen item </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">exists. There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that rules not to accept it even if the robber seeks only to fulfill his obligation to Heaven is referring to a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item does not </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">exist. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the incident in which the robber’s wife told him that he would have to return even the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt, </span>which was the impetus for instituting the ordinance for the penitents, was a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">exists, </span>in which case the robber would be obligated to return it even after the ordinance was instituted. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by: Even the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt? </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the belt, </span>but the actual belt was no longer in his possession.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not institute an ordinance </span>for the penitent <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">exists? But there is </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is a stolen item that </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">exists, and we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 55a): <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a stolen beam that </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">built into a building, </span>the Sages instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">should take its monetary </span>value and not the actual beam <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the ordinance </span>instituted for <span class="gemarra-regular">the penitent, </span>i.e., so that the penitent not be required to destroy his house. This indicates that the ordinance instituted for the penitent is in effect even when the stolen item still exists. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There it is different. Since </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is the loss of the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">building</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages treat </span>the beam <span class="gemarra-regular">as though it were not </span>in existence.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant cow, and it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth </span>while in the robber’s possession, or if one robbed another of a ewe that was laden with wool and the robber then sheared it, he pays the owner the value of a cow that is ready to give birth, or the value of a ewe that is ready to be shorn. In connection with this, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who robs </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ewe and sheared it, </span>and similarly, one who robs another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow and it gave birth, </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay it and its sheared </span>wool <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it and <span class="gemarra-regular">its offspring; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: A stolen item is returned as is. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>A stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised </span>at the time of the robbery, and the robber pays only that amount.
The Gemara clarifies the different opinions in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir, </span>who holds that the robber returns the animal and its sheared wool or the animal and its offspring? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he holds </span>that despite <span class="gemarra-regular">a change, </span>the changed item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place? </span>Despite its changes, the animal always remained in the possession of the robbery victims, and consequently any increase in value belongs to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">generally </span>holds that one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in it, and therefore the wool or offspring should belong to the robber by right, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here it is a penalty that he imposes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which forces the robber to return items that are technically his.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case does the reasoning of Rabbi Meir make a practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference? In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the stolen item was <span class="gemarra-regular">devalued </span>since the time of the robbery. If Rabbi Meir’s reason is that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place, it is returned as is, even if its current value is less than what its value had been at the time of the robbery. But if he requires the robber to return the item itself because of a penalty, and by right the robber acquired the animal due to the change, then in this case, where the value decreased, the robber would be required to return what its value had been at the time of the robbery.
The Gemara attempts to find a solution to this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was taught in the mishna (96b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal and it aged </span>while in his possession, consequently diminishing its value, or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves and they aged, he pays according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. Rabbi Meir says: With regard to slaves, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this indicates that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>that aged while in the possession of the robber Rabbi Meir concedes to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, and he too holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays according to </span>what its value had been at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery.</span>
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that despite <span class="gemarra-regular">a change, </span>the changed item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains in its place, </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>should be returned as it is in the case of the animal that aged, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, </span>in the case of a stolen animal that subsequently was shorn or gave birth, the payment of wool or offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">is a penalty </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">which he penalizes </span>the robber, so that the robber will not benefit from the increased value of the stolen item?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Rabbi Meir’s reasoning cannot be proven from the mishna, since it is possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir is speaking to </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the Rabbis’ </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">statement. </span>His statement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to my own </span>opinion, one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an animal </span>that was stolen and then aged should be returned as it is now, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. But according to you, who say </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in it, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with me in any event </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a slave, </span>he is returned as is. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because his legal status is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">real estate, and real estate cannot be stolen. And the Rabbis say to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>for the purpose of robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">the legal status of a slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property.</span>
The Gemara again attempts to find a solution to the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was taught in the mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye it red for him and he dyed it black, </span>or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner of the wool the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool,</span> since the dyer violated the owner’s wishes. It can be inferred from this mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool, yes, </span>he must give it; but the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and its enhancement,</span> i.e., the amount by which the value of the wool increased because it was dyed, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he need not give it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in the item, the dyer should be <span class="gemarra-regular">required to return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and its enhancement to </span>the owner, as it never left the owner’s possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here,</span> in the case of a stolen animal that was subsequently shorn or gave birth, the payment of wool or offspring <span class="gemarra-regular">is a penalty </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">which he penalizes </span>the robber, so that the robber will not benefit from the increased value of the stolen item? The Gemara affirms this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the mishna that this is indeed the reasoning of Rabbi Meir.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: This, </span>i.e., Rabbi Meir’s reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">was never in question for us. </span>Why not? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav reversed </span>the opinions in the mishna on 96b <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught </span>it as follows: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal and it aged, </span>or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves and they aged, he pays according to </span>what their value had been at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: With regard to slaves, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. Certainly, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>an item due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>in the item, which is why the robber pays according to what its value had been at the time of the robbery. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the cow that gave birth or the ewe that was shorn, the payment of offspring or wool <span class="gemarra-regular">is a penalty </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">which he penalizes </span>the robber.
The Gemara continues the alternative explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">When we asked </span>the question, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is how we asked </span>it: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">penalizes </span>the robber, is it only for one who robbed <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, but </span>if one took an item from its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally, </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">does not penalize </span>the robber? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he penalizes even </span>one who took an item from its owner <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally.</span>
The Gemara tries to resolve this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> types of monetary claims <span class="gemarra-regular">are collected </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥorarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>property, i.e., property that is still in possession of its owner and has not been sold in the meantime.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And these are they: Produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>value of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if one has the right to the produce of a particular property, or the gain accrued from that produce, he cannot claim this payment from liened property. The Gemara continues with the list of monetary claims collected from unsold property: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who accepts upon himself </span>at the time of his betrothal the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to provide sustenance for his wife’s so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or his wife’s daughter </span>from a previous marriage; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a promissory note that has no </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee,</span> i.e., a document that does not explicitly state that all of the properties of the debtor will serve to guarantee payment of the debt; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman’s marriage contract that has no </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whom did you hear that says </span>that omission of the <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee </span>of the sale from the document <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a scribal error</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>There is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis with regard to a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee. According to the Rabbis, it was omitted in error and is always considered as having been written in the document. Rabbi Meir holds that a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee cannot be used to collect property that has been liened or sold; it can be used to collect only unsold property. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is therefore in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>value of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>are collected only from unsold property.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which he collects the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>value of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce? </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it to another, and </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced it, and it is now leaving the possession </span>of the purchaser because the robbery victim has proved in court that this field is his. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>from the robber who sold him this field, in order to recoup what he had paid, 

Daf 95b

he can <span class="gemarra-regular">collect the principal, </span>i.e., what he paid for the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">liened property </span>that has been sold. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he can collect <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhanced </span>value, i.e., the value of the improvements made to the field, only <span class="gemarra-regular">from unsold property. </span>Why are both of these collected from the robber? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because the owner of the field came and took </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">his land and its enhanced </span>value.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a purchaser who is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ignoramus, who does not know whether property can be stolen or cannot be stolen, </span>and when he purchased stolen land from the robber, he did so unintentionally, since he was under the mistaken impression that this land belonged to the robber who sold it? <span class="gemarra-regular">And even so, the owner of the land can come and take the land and its enhanced </span>value. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if so, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">penalizes even </span>one who acquires stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of a purchaser </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he knew </span>that the robber had no right to sell this land. The purchaser is therefore penalized and is required to return the enhanced value of the land as well.
The Gemara again tries to determine the scope of the penalty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was taught in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye it red for him and he dyed it black, </span>or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner of the wool the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool, </span>since the dyer violated the owner’s instructions. It can be inferred from the mishna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool, yes, </span>he must give; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and its enhanced </span>value, i.e., the amount by which the value of the wool increased because it was dyed, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he is not required to give.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">penalizes </span>one who acquires a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally as well, </span>the dyer should be <span class="gemarra-regular">required to return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and its enhancement to him. Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>the mishna that if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">penalizes </span>the robber, but if it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentionally he does not penalize </span>him? The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the mishna that this indeed is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A stolen item is returned as is. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised </span>at the time of the robbery. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>since ostensibly they agree that the robber does not return the value of the enhancement to the robbery victim?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid says: They disagree with regard to enhancement that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the stolen item</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The disagreement concerns a case where the enhancement occurred while the stolen item was in the possession of the robber, and when he returned the item it was still enhanced. Therefore, he did not keep any of the enhancement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that the enhancement <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the one who was robbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon holds that it belongs to the robber.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that the disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon can be explained differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>agrees that the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the stolen item belongs to the robber, and here they disagree </span>with regard to whether the robber can keep <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third, or one-fourth</span> of the value of the enhancement, and the remainder is kept by the owner of the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the stolen item belongs entirely to the robber, and Rabbi Shimon holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the robber takes one-half, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third, or one-fourth </span>of the value of the enhancement. In other words, he is treated as a shepherd or rancher and receives the share of the enhancement that local custom dictates be paid to that type of laborer.
The Gemara cites a proof for Rav Zevid’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna (93b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow, and it became pregnant in his </span>possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth; </span>or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ewe, and it became laden </span>with wool <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sheared it, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays according to </span>the value of the animal at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. </span>The Gemara infers from the mishna: If the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth, yes, </span>he pays the value of the animal at the time of the theft, but if the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">did not give birth </span>and is still pregnant, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">returned as is.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, enhancement that is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the stolen item belongs to the one who was robbed, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>as the pregnant cow is returned as is. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, who says </span>that everyone agrees that the enhancement <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the robber, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>is it in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the robber does not retain any of the enhanced value.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that the inference is incorrect: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same is true </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it did not give birth, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays according to </span>the value of the animal at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery, </span>and the enhanced value due to the pregnancy is returned to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which the mishna teaches: It </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth, </span>cannot serve as the basis for an inference pertaining to this discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> needs to <span class="gemarra-regular">cite </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it gave birth </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, since in that case he acquires the animal due to the change in its condition, therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he cites</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it gave birth </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause as well, </span>but it need not have given birth. It cannot be inferred from this mishna that an animal that has not given birth is returned as is.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappa. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised </span>at the time of the theft, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of keeping <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third, or one-fourth </span>of the value of the enhancement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: When we were </span>studying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the study hall of Rav Kahana, we were asked </span>a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">According </span>to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says that the robber takes one-half, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third, or one-fourth </span>of the value of the enhancement; <span class="gemarra-regular">when we remove </span>the robber, taking the stolen animal from him and paying him a portion of the enhanced value, do <span class="gemarra-regular">we remove him </span>by paying him his share <span class="gemarra-regular">with money? Or, perhaps he takes </span>his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the meat </span>of the animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we resolved the </span>dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which Rav Naḥman says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>cases, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">appraises the enhanced </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the parties involved in enhancing a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are paid in money </span>rather than by being given a portion of the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these are they: A firstborn </span>son who makes payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to a regular </span>son. This is a case where two sons, one firstborn and the other not, inherit a field from their father. Before it is divided, they both work and enhance the field. When the time comes to divide the field, the firstborn son, who receives a double portion, must pay his brother for the enhancement that the latter contributed to the former’s portion. This payment is given in money rather than land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the second case is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>who is obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to a purchaser, </span>i.e., a creditor who collects the debt from lands that were sold by the debtor. He pays money to the purchaser for the enhancements generated by the purchaser but does not pay him in land. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the third case is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor </span>who is obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to orphans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a creditor who collects land from the orphans of his debtor. He must pay them for any enhancements done by the orphans after their father’s death. This payment is also given in money rather than land.
The Gemara discusses Shmuel’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a creditor gives the purchaser </span>any of the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>value at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t Shmuel say: A creditor collects </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhanced </span>value? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where Shmuel stated that a creditor does not collect the enhanced value, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where there was <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement that reaches shoulders [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hammaggia</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">likhtefayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the produce that grew due to the improvements made by the purchaser is fully grown and ripened and can now be harvested and carried upon one’s shoulders. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there, </span>where Shmuel stated that a creditor does collect the enhanced value, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where there was <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement that does not reach shoulders, </span>i.e., its growth is not complete.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">daily incidents </span>of this type, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel would collect </span>from purchasers <span class="gemarra-regular">even enhancement that reached shoulders. </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>

Daf 96a

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>ruling, that Shmuel would collect the enhanced value, is for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is owe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">the amount of </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the land and the enhanced value. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>ruling, that Shmuel would not collect the value of the enhancement, is for a case where the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is owed by </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">only the amount of </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the land.</span>
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This works out well according to the one who says: If the purchaser </span>of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">has money, he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot remove the creditor </span>from the land, i.e., the creditor has the right to collect the land. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. But according to the one who says: If the purchaser </span>of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">has money, he can remove the creditor </span>from the land, i.e., the purchaser can choose to pay him money instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">say: If I had money, I would remove you from all of the land; now </span>that I do not have sufficient money to pay what you are owed, <span class="gemarra-regular">give me </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">riva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of land, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the amount of my enhancement.</span>
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>this field as <span class="gemarra-regular">designated repayment for him, as he said to him: You shall not be repaid from anything but this, </span>in which case he clearly has a lien on this field and nothing else.
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of a stolen item that has been enhanced. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and enhanced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and enhanced </span>it and then died <span class="gemarra-regular">and bequeathed </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold that which he enhanced and bequeathed that which he enhanced. </span>And the robbery victim, should he wish to recover the stolen item, must pay the purchaser or heir for the enhanced value.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma </span>related to the aforementioned <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser enhance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the stolen item? Must the robbery victim pay the purchaser for the enhanced value or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the dilemma, he then resolved it: What has the first </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to the second </span>in any sale? He has sold <span class="gemarra-regular">any rights that will come into his possession. </span>Since the robber had the rights to the value of his enhancements to the stolen item, he sold those rights to the purchaser as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>robber <span class="gemarra-regular">enhance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the value of a stolen item? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Shall we arise and institute an ordinance for </span>the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile? </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This question <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary </span>except <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it was the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it to a Jew. </span>Rava was asking if the Jew needs to return the enhanced value. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, one who comes </span>to possess an item <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>purchasing it from <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like a gentile </span>himself because, as stated previously, in any sale the purchaser’s rights are identical to the seller’s. Since the Sages did not institute ordinances for the benefit of gentiles, the Jewish purchaser does not have those rights either.
The Gemara explains: This question <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary </span>except <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it was the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that a Jew robbed </span>another of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold it to </span>a gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the gentile enhanced it, and </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile went back and sold it to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: Since it was initially </span>stolen by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew and </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>acquired by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, the Sages did institute an ordinance? Or, perhaps since there is </span>the ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile intervening, the Sages did not institute an ordinance. </span>The Gemara comments: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that if one robbed another of wood and fashioned it into vessels, he acquired the wood due to the change. The Gemara discusses what qualifies as a change. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this one who robbed another of a palm tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cut it </span>down, <span class="gemarra-regular">although he threw it from the land </span>of the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">to his own land, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The tree was <span class="gemarra-regular">initially called a palm tree, and now, </span>although it has been cut down, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is also called a palm tree, </span>so the change to the item is not sufficiently significant for the robber to acquire it. Moreover, if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree and made </span>it into <span class="gemarra-regular">logs, he did not acquire it, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any event, they are called palm tree logs.</span>
By contrast, if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">logs and fashioned them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">beams, he has acquired </span>them, since this change is significant. If one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">large beams and fashioned them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">small beams, he did not acquire them, </span>since they are still called beams. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, he did acquire </span>them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This one who robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm fron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fashioned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hutzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he removed the leaves from the spine, <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">since initially it was called a palm frond and now </span>it is called <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves. </span>One who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves and fashioned them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a broom has acquired them, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>they were called <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves, and now </span>they are called <span class="gemarra-regular">a broom. </span>One who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a broom</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope has not acquired it. What is the reason </span>for this? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">go back </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">unravel it, and it will </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">be a broom.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>central <span class="gemarra-regular">twin-leaf became split</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., is this considered a change through which a stolen <span class="it-text">lulav</span> would be acquired? The Gemara cites a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Matun says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>central <span class="gemarra-regular">twin-leaf was removed, </span>the <span class="it-text">lulav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is unfit. </span>

Daf 96b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true for </span>a case where the central twin-leaf <span class="gemarra-regular">became split, </span>i.e., that this <span class="it-text">lulav</span> has been rendered unfit to be used for the mitzva, and the robber has acquired the <span class="it-text">lulav</span> as a result of this change? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">was removed is different, as </span>the result is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is lacking, </span>and an incomplete <span class="it-text">lulav</span> is certainly unfit. But if the leaf remains in place, albeit split, it does not necessarily render the <span class="it-text">lulav</span> unfit. The <span class="it-text">lulav</span> has not been changed and therefore the robber does not acquire it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the question was resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Matun says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>central <span class="gemarra-regular">twin-leaf became split</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it becomes like </span>a <span class="it-text">lulav</span> whose central <span class="gemarra-regular">twin-leaf was </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">removed, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>his statement that if the central twin-leaf became split, the robber has acquired the <span class="it-text">lulav</span> as a result of the change.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This one who robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">eart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fashioned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a bric</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not acquired </span>it due to the change. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and convert it </span>back into <span class="gemarra-regular">earth. </span>By contrast, if he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a brick, and </span>by crushing it <span class="gemarra-regular">turned it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has acquired it </span>due to the change. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say: Perhaps </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and fashion it </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a brick? This is a different brick, and a new entity has arrived, </span>i.e., entered into existence, <span class="gemarra-regular">here.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This one who robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bar of silver [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naskha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fashioned </span>it into <span class="gemarra-regular">coin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not acquired it </span>due to the change. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? He can <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it and by melting the coins <span class="gemarra-regular">turn them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a bar of silver. </span>By contrast, if he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">coins and fashioned them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a bar of silver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has acquired them </span>due to the change. <span class="gemarra-regular">What do you say </span>in response to this, that perhaps he will <span class="gemarra-regular">return and fashion them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">coins? </span>These are new coins, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a new entity has arrived here.</span>
Rav Pappa continues: If the stolen coins were <span class="gemarra-regular">black [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥimei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., old and used, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he made them </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">ne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> by cleaning them thoroughly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired </span>them. By contrast, if however, they were <span class="gemarra-regular">new, and he made them black, he has acquired </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What do you say </span>in response to this, that perhaps he will <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">make them new </span>by cleaning them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Their blackness is already known, </span>and therefore the coins have been changed irreversibly.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: All robbers pay according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is added </span>by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle? </span>The Gemara replies: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to add that which Rabbi Ela says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole a lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>during the time that it was in the thief’s possession it <span class="gemarra-regular">became a ram, </span>or if one stole <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">became an ox, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">a change occurred </span>while the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession, and he has acquired it </span>due to the change. If he then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters his own </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sells his own </span>animal, and he does not become liable to pay the penalty of four or five times the value of the animal.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who robbed another </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pair </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">padna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He then <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed </span>his field <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sowed seeds with them, and eventually returned them to their owner. </span>The robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>to claim payment from the robber. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the robbery victim and the robber: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go estimate </span>the amount by <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the value of the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was enhanced </span>during the time that the pair of oxen was in the possession of the robber, and the robber must pay that amount.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: Did <span class="gemarra-regular">the oxen </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">enhance </span>the value of the land? <span class="gemarra-regular">Did the land not </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced </span>in and of itself? Perhaps not all of the enhanced value of the land was due to the labor performed by the oxen. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Did I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they should estimate </span>and give him <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the enhanced value? <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">half. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Ultimately, it is a stolen item and is returned as it was </span>at the time of the robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All robbers pay according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. </span>Why should the robber also pay the owner half the value of the enhancement?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tell you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when I am sitting in judgment, do not say anything to me, </span>i.e., do not question or comment upon my rulings. An indication that my rulings should not be questioned is <span class="gemarra-regular">as our friend Huna has said about me, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">King Shapu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I are brothers with regard to </span>monetary <span class="gemarra-regular">laws, </span>i.e., with regard to monetary laws, my opinion is equal to that of Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">This man is an experienced robber, and I wish to penalize him. </span>Therefore, I compelled him to pay the enhanced value, although by right he is not obligated to do so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">age</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> while in his possession, consequently diminishing its value, or if one robbed another of Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves and they aged </span>while in his possession, they have been changed. The robber therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">pays according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. Rabbi Meir says: With regard to </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, he says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you.</span>
If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a coin and it cracked, </span>thereby reducing its value; or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and it rotted; </span>or if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and it fermented, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery.</span>
If he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a coin and it was invalidated </span>by the government; or if he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it became ritually impure; </span>or if he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it, </span>and therefore it is prohibited to derive benefit from it; or if he robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal and a sin was performed with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby disqualifying it for use as an offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">or if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was disqualifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>being sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the altar </span>for some other reason; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was going out to be stoned </span>because it gored and killed a person at some point after the robbery, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>In all of these cases, although the value of the stolen item has been diminished or altogether lost, since the change is not externally discernible, the robber returns the item in its current state.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that one who robbed another of an animal that aged pays what its value was at the time of the robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">aged </span>means that it <span class="gemarra-regular">actually aged. But even </span>if the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">weakened, </span>which is a less significant change, it is still considered changed, and the robber has acquired the animal. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that it <span class="gemarra-regular">aged, </span>indicating that a lesser change, e.g., weakening, is not significant? The Gemara responds: Rav Pappa was speaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">weakening </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">like aging, </span>i.e., the animal became so weak <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">will not return </span>to its former <span class="gemarra-regular">health.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Kashisha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: This is what they say in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even if one stole a lamb and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">became a ram, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">became an ox, </span>it is considered that <span class="gemarra-regular">a change occurred </span>while the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, and he has acquired it </span>due to this change. If he then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughters his own </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sells his own </span>animal, and he does not become liable to pay the penalty of four or five times the value of the animal. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Didn’t I say to you: Do not exchange </span>the names of the <span class="gemarra-regular">men</span> in whose name you are transmitting words of Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated in the name of Rabbi Ela, </span>not in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: With regard to </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves, he says to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanina bar Avdimi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav set aside </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who are the majority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and practice </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir? </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> in the <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>manner, i.e., with the opinions reversed, so that the Rabbis, rather than Rabbi Meir, hold that with regard to slaves the robber says: That which is yours is before you. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav set aside the mishna and practice </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav also teaches the mishna </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reasoning of Rav, who reversed </span>the opinions in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna in light of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? On the contrary, let him reverse </span>the opinions in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in light of the mishna. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav also learned the mishna </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>manner. Rav did not decide to reverse the opinions in the mishna. In the text of the mishna that he utilized, the opinions were the same as in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that Rav did in fact decide to reverse the opinions in the mishna, based upon the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">When he does not reverse </span>a mishna due to a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>mishna that he will not reverse <span class="gemarra-regular">in light of one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>. But <span class="gemarra-regular">he would reverse one </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in light of two </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, and in this case there is a second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in which the opinions are the reverse of those found in the mishna.
The second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 8:23–24): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who exchanges a cow for a donkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>in the meantime the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">gave birth; and similarly, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells his </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant, and </span>in the meantime <span class="gemarra-regular">she gave birth, </span>if in either of these cases the purchaser and seller have a dispute as to when the birth took place, where <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: She gave birth </span>at the time that she was <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession </span>and therefore the offspring is mine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other is silent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then the one who stated definitively that she gave birth while in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>the offspring. If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I do not know, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I do not know</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall divide </span>the value of the offspring.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>She gave birth while <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>She gave birth while <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller must take an oath that she gave birth </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession, as anyone who </span>is obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath that is </span>enumerated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes an oath and does not pay; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>In this case, since the seller initially had possession of the animal or the maidservant, he is considered the defendant, and therefore it is sufficient for him to take an oath to exempt himself from payment and maintain possession of the offspring.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not take an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concerning either </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves or concerning land. </span>This indicates that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, Canaanite slaves have the legal status of land, whereas according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, they do not. It follows, then, that in the mishna here as well, it is the Rabbis, and not Rabbi Meir, who maintain that, with regard to slaves, one says: That which is yours is before you, as one does with regard to land.
The Gemara asks: If it is true that the opinion that the mishna attributed to Rabbi Meir was attributed by Rav to the Rabbis, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>is imprecise. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: According to </span>the way <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you have reversed </span>the opinions in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you taught </span>that Rabbi Meir says that the robber says to the robbery victim: That which is yours is before you, then the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>despite the fact that according to Rav, this is the opinion of the Rabbis. 

Daf 97a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the legal status of a Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">real estate? But doesn’t Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One who seizes another’s </span>Canaanite <span class="gemarra-regular">slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and performs labor with him is exempt </span>from paying the master for the labor of the slave? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that, in Rav’s opinion, the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">real estate, why </span>is he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying? A slave, like real estate, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of his owner, </span>wherever he might be. Therefore, the one who seized him did not steal the slave, in which case he could simply return him. Rather, he made use of a slave belonging to another and should be liable to pay for the master’s loss of the slave’s labor.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case where the one who seized the slave forced him to perform labor when it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not during </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">working hours. </span>Consequently, he did not prevent the slave from performing labor for his master. Since the owner did not incur any loss, the one who seized the slave is not obligated to pay for the benefit that he derived from the slave. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>message <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Abba sent to Mari bar Mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ask Rav Huna </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides in another’s courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge: Does he need to pay him rent, or does he not need to pay him rent? And they sent to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">He does not need to pay him rent, </span>since the owner of the property did not incur any monetary loss.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? Granted, there, </span>in the case of a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the reasoning for that <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says: An inhabited hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> remains <span class="gemarra-regular">habitable, </span>and it is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">satisfactory for </span>the owner of the property to have someone residing in his courtyard, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the reasoning is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that since the verse states: “In the city is left desolation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the gate is smitten unto ruin” </span>(Isaiah 24:12), which indicates that a desolate house will fall into ruin but an inhabited house will be maintained, either way it is satisfactory <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the owner that one stay in his courtyard. Consequently, the one who resides there need not pay rent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of a slave, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it satisfactory for him that his slave be weakened </span>by performing labor for another? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Indeed, it is satisfactory for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him that </span>the work habits of <span class="gemarra-regular">his slave not be undone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara records a related incident. Members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">house of Rav Yosef bar Ḥam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would, </span>with his approval, <span class="gemarra-regular">seize the slaves of people who owed him money, and they would work them </span>against the will of the owners. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son of</span> Rav Yosef bar Ḥama, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master does this, </span>i.e., seizes and uses these slaves? Rav Yosef bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As Rav Naḥman says: A slave is not worth </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">the bread in his stomach. </span>When the slaves work for me and eat in my home, I am not causing the owners any monetary loss. Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s son <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will say that Rav Naḥman said </span>this with regard to specific slaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as his slave Daru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">dances among </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">barrels [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuvei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and does not perform any labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves perform labor, </span>and their labor is worth more than their board.
Rav Yosef bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Daniel, as Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: One who seizes another’s slave and performs labor with him is exempt </span>from paying the master for the labor of the slave. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">satisfactory for </span>the master <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the work habits of <span class="gemarra-regular">his slave not be undone.</span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This statement </span>of Rav Daniel applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the one who seizes the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">is not owed money </span>by the owner of the slave. But <span class="gemarra-regular">since the Master is owed money b</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the owner of the slave, this <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">appearance of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: Although </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">lent </span>money to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">resided in the courtyard of another, </span>i.e., that of his creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">he needs to pay him rent, </span>to avoid the appearance of interest. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ḥama said to him: I retract </span>my opinion, and will no longer seize the slaves of my debtors.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who seizes another’s shi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and performs labor with it, </span>what payment can the ship’s owner claim? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that he may choose: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the cost of the ship’s <span class="gemarra-regular">rent, </span>and if he <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the amount by which the value of the ship was <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>by being used for this labor, whichever amount is larger. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: He </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">take only</span> the amount by which the value of the ship was <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>They <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree. </span>They were addressing different cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>i.e., Rav’s statement, is referring to a ship <span class="gemarra-regular">that is commonly </span>available <span class="gemarra-regular">for rental. That, </span>i.e., Shmuel’s statement, is referring to a ship that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not commonly </span>available <span class="gemarra-regular">for rental. And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">This and that </span>statement are both referring to a ship <span class="gemarra-regular">that is commonly </span>available <span class="gemarra-regular">for rental. This, </span>Rav’s statement, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who seized the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">descended, </span>i.e., took possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">with the intention of renting </span>the ship. He pays for the rental. <span class="gemarra-regular">That, </span>Shmuel’s statement, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who seized the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">descended with the intention of robbery, </span>to use it without paying. He is regarded as a robber and pays only the amount by which its value was diminished.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a coin and it cracked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he pays the value of the coin at the time of the robbery, as he has acquired it due to its change. But if the coin was invalidated, he says: That which is yours is before you. Since this is not a significant change, he has not acquired it. The Sages disagree with regard to the explanation of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: </span>When the mishna states that the coin <span class="gemarra-regular">cracked, </span>it means that it <span class="gemarra-regular">actually cracked; </span>when it says that the coin was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated, </span>it means that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated by the governmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and is therefore unfit for use.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda says: </span>A coin <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated by the government is </span>the same as a coin that is <span class="gemarra-regular">cracked, </span>because its complete loss of value is a significant change. <span class="gemarra-regular">But what are the circumstances </span>of the mishna, in which a coin that was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated </span>is not considered changed? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a coin <span class="gemarra-regular">was invalidated </span>by the government in <span class="gemarra-regular">this province</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the residents there can no longer use it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the coin still <span class="gemarra-regular">circulates </span>and is in use <span class="gemarra-regular">in another province.</span>
The Gemara clarifies Rav Huna’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Huna: According to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you said </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated </span>means that the coin was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">government, </span>and the mishna rules that in that case the robber can return it as is, there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what of the cases in the mishna of one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and it rotted </span>or one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and it fermented, which are similar to </span>a coin that was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated by the government, </span>since none of these items are fit for use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>their value at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery </span>because they underwent a change? Why would the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> be different in the case of a coin that was invalidated by the government?
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>in the cases of produce and wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">its taste and its smell changed. Here, </span>in the case of the coin that was invalidated, the coin itself <span class="gemarra-regular">did not change.</span>
The Gemara clarifies Rav Yehuda’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Yehuda: According to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you said </span>that a coin that was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated by the government is </span>the same as one that <span class="gemarra-regular">cracked, </span>and the mishna rules that in that case the robber pays according to its value at the time of the robbery, there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what of the case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it became impure, which is similar to </span>a coin that was <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidated by the government, and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you.</span>
Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>in the case of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is not evident, </span>since it is impossible to tell the difference between pure and impure items. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the coin, <span class="gemarra-regular">the damage is evident, </span>since one can tell by looking at it that it is the type of coin that was invalidated.
§ With regard to a coin that was invalidated, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that there was a dispute concerning the question: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who lends </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">another on </span>the condition that he repay the loan using a particular kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">coin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that coin becomes invalidated, Rav says: </span>

Daf 97b

The debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him a coin that is in circulation at that time </span>with which he repays the loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the creditor: I am giving you a coin like the one you gave me, although you cannot utilize it here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Go spend it in Meishan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a distant place where this coin is still in circulation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Shmuel’s statement is reasonable when </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">has a way to go to Meishan, </span>i.e., he intends to travel there, and therefore the debtor can tell him to spend the coin when he arrives at his destination. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no way </span>to go to Meishan, i.e., he does not intend to go there, the debtor may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>give him these coins. Rather, he must give him coins that are in circulation in their current location.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ma’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 1:6): <span class="gemarra-regular">One cannot desacraliz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">onto coins that are not in circulation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How so? If one had coins of bar Kokheva [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kozeviyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> coins <span class="gemarra-regular">of Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>coins <span class="gemarra-regular">of earlier kings, </span>all of which are no longer in use, one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot desacralize </span>second<span class="gemarra-regular">-</span>tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto them. Rava infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one had coins <span class="gemarra-regular">of later, </span>i.e., current, kings, that are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the coins of the <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>kings in that they have been invalidated in his location, since they are still valid elsewhere, one <span class="gemarra-regular">can desacralize </span>the second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto them. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not make a distinction as to whether the owner of the produce intends to travel to the location where those coins are in use or not.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With what are we dealing here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">kingdoms are not particular with one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They allow a coin that has been invalidated in their province to be taken out of their borders and spent in a province where it is valid. Since these coins can be given to those planning to travel to the location where it is valid, it is considered to be a valid coin even in the location of the one desacralizing the second-tithe produce.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But, </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Shmuel said </span>that the debtor can repay his debt with invalidated coins only if the creditor intends to travel to a location where they are valid, he is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">kingdoms are particula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with each other. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can he bring </span>these coins to Meishan without the authorities confiscating them? The Gemara responds: Shmuel is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the creditor can <span class="gemarra-regular">bring them with difficulty, </span>as in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">do not search, but if they find </span>any invalid coins <span class="gemarra-regular">they are particular </span>to confiscate them. It is therefore possible to bring these coins into the other kingdom. Nevertheless, since the authorities are particular, one who does not plan to travel there will not be able to exchange these coins with anyone in his location.
The Gemara questions Shmuel’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ma’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 1:6): <span class="gemarra-regular">One cannot desacralize </span>second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">onto money of </span>Eretz Yisrael, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">they, </span>the coins and their owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">are in Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>one cannot do so onto money <span class="gemarra-regular">of Babylonia when they, </span>the coins and their owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">are here </span>in Eretz Yisrael. If one uses money <span class="gemarra-regular">of Babylonia and they are in Babylonia, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">can desacralize </span>the second-tithe produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> desacralize </span>second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">onto money of </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia. </span>And this is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they will ultimately ascend to there, </span>Eretz Yisrael, as the very purpose of transferring the sanctity to the coins is to spend them in Jerusalem.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">kingdoms are </span>especially <span class="gemarra-regular">particular with one another, </span>and it is impossible to transport coins from one location to the other. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the kingdoms are especially particular with one another, then with regard to the case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which sanctity is transferred onto money <span class="gemarra-regular">of Babylonia and they are in Babylonia, for what are these </span>coins <span class="gemarra-regular">fit? </span>In any case they cannot be brought to Jerusalem. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are fit for purchasing an animal with them </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">that will be brought up to Jerusalem.</span>
With regard to the statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that one cannot desacralize second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto Babylonian money when in Eretz Yisrael, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted that </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">money shall circulate in Jerusalem because of this reason, </span>i.e., so that Jews from all locations will be able to use their local currencies? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that all money is valid in Jerusalem is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a time when the authority of the Jewish people is dominan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over the nations of the world </span>and could enforce the rabbinic enactments. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that sanctity may not be transferred onto Babylonian money when in Eretz Yisrael, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a time when the authority of the nations of the world is dominant over them, </span>i.e., the Jews, at which time foreign currency was not usable in Jerusalem.
Having mentioned the coins of Jerusalem, the Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coin of </span>ancient <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The names <span class="gemarra-regular">David and Solomo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> were inscribed <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side, and Jerusalem the Holy City </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other side. And what is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coin of Abraham our forefather? An old man and an old woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> representing Abraham and Sarah, were inscribed <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side, and a young man and a young woman, </span>representing Isaac and Rebecca, were <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other side.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava inquired of Rav Ḥisda: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who lends </span>money to <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the condition that he repay the loan in <span class="gemarra-regular">coin, </span>i.e., with the specific denomination of a currency, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the government <span class="gemarra-regular">added t</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> the size of the coin, so that a coin of the same denomination now weighs more? Is the debtor obligated to return the newly adjusted coin, or can he repay the debt according to the prior weight of the coin that he borrowed? Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: He gives him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coin that is in circulation at the time </span>of the payment. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And </span>is this the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the new coin is as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as a sieve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>And is this the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tartiya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes.</span>
Rava challenged: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>by increasing the weight of this coin, the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce has decreased in price, </span>and since more produce can be purchased with this coin, giving it to the creditor as repayment is a form of interest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: We examine </span>the situation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">decreased in price due to </span>the change in the weight of <span class="gemarra-regular">the coin, </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">is reduced for </span>the debtor and the creditor is repaid with coins that equal the prior value of the loan. 

Daf 98a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">decreased in price due to the market </span>value, the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">is not reduced for him.</span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the value of the coin <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>been <span class="gemarra-regular">enhanced for the purpose of </span>melting it down into <span class="gemarra-regular">a bar of metal. </span>Since this coin now contains a larger quantity of metal, if it were to be melted it would be worth more than an earlier coin of the same type, so it should be considered interest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>in this case one must act <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with how Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>acted when they <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an action with the dinars of Agardami</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Arab merchant [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tayya’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> They considered <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten </span>old coins to be the equivalent <span class="gemarra-regular">of eigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> new coins. Since ten old coins were equivalent in value to eight new coins, they paid eight new coins in exchange for ten old ones.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: One who throws another’s coi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the Great Sea is exempt </span>from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? He can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The coin <span class="gemarra-regular">is resting before you; if you wish, take it. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies only if the coin is <span class="gemarra-regular">in translucent </span>water, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner of the coin <span class="gemarra-regular">can see </span>the coin, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">turbid </span>water, <span class="gemarra-regular">where he cannot see </span>the coin, it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply, and the one that threw it will be liable to compensate the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when he rolled </span>the coin into the sea without picking it up, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the coin <span class="gemarra-regular">with his hands </span>and threw it into the sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has robbed </span>the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to perform </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning </span>the coin to its owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>to the statement of Rabba from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ma’aser</span> <span class="it-text">Sheni</span> 1:6): One <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot desacralize </span>second tithe by transferring its sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">onto money that is not in his possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he had money in a fortress [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kastera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in the King’s Mountain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Har</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">HaMelekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or if his purse fell into the Great Sea, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not desacralize </span>second tithe by transferring its sanctity onto that money. This indicates that money that fell into the Great Sea is considered lost. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>This is not difficult; it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different with regard to </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, since it is necessary </span>that the money be <span class="gemarra-regular">found in the hand </span>of the one who wishes to desacralize the tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: “Then you shall turn it into money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bind up the money in your hand, </span>and shall go to the place that the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 14:25), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if it is in the Great Sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>in his hand, but nevertheless it is not considered lost.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One who effaces </span>the image of <span class="gemarra-regular">another’s coi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt </span>from paying damages, even though he caused the coin to lose value. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As he did not do anything, </span>the coin remains the same size as before. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this statement </span>applies only in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he struck it with a hammer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kurnesa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and flattened it; but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he filed it with a file [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shofina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> he must pay the amount of the reduction in value, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he caused it to diminis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> in size.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>to the statement of Rabba from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 9:26): If a master <span class="gemarra-regular">struck </span>his slave <span class="gemarra-regular">on his eye and blinded it, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">on his ear and deafened it, the slave is emancipated by means of these </span>injuries. If he struck the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">near his eye and </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not see, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these </span>injuries. The first clause indicates that one is liable for damage caused even if it is not visible damage.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rabba says: One who deafens his father is put to death, </span>even though no bruise is visible, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is impossible for deafening </span>to occur <span class="gemarra-regular">without a bruise, </span>as it is certain <span class="gemarra-regular">that a drop of blood fell into his ear </span>from the blow, even if it is not visible from the outside. Striking someone in the ear in a manner that causes deafness results in a significant physical change, while striking a coin with a hammer does not detract from the actual size of the coin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One who slits the ear of another’s co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt </span>from paying damages, even though this cow is no longer fit to be sacrificed as an offering due to the injury. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cow was available </span>for many uses until now, so <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">available </span>for those uses now, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the one who slit its ear <span class="gemarra-regular">did not do anything </span>to damage the cow in a substantial way. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>concerning the fact that it is rendered disqualified from being sacrificed as an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">not all oxen stand near the altar, </span>i.e., most animals are not sacrificed as offerings anyway, so it is not considered a loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection</span> from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who performs a task with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">water of purification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the water that is mixed with the ashes of the red heifer and sprinkled upon one who has become impure as part of the purification ritual, <span class="gemarra-regular">or with </span>the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer of purification, </span>whose ashes are mixed with springwater and sprinkled on those who have contracted impurity imparted by a corpse on the third and seventh days of their impurity, is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt according to human laws, </span>since he has not caused any discernible damage, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable according to the laws of Heaven. </span>It may be inferred from here that one is exempt from liability according to human laws only if he performed <span class="gemarra-regular">a task </span>with those items, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the damage </span>that he caused <span class="gemarra-regular">is not evident, but </span>in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">slits </span>the ear, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the damage is evident, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed liable according to human laws.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same is true that even one who slits </span>the ear <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>according to human laws, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that specified cases where the damage is not evident <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: That even </span>one who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">a task </span>with the water of purification or the red heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the damage is not evident, is liable according to the laws of Heaven.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One who burns another’s </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt, as </span>the one who burned it can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I have burned </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">your paper, </span>and he is not held liable for the fact that the creditor will no longer be able to prove that he had provided the loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama objects to this: What are the circumstances? </span>

Daf 98b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If there are witnesses who know what was </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, they should write a </span>new, <span class="gemarra-regular">proper, </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note for him, </span>and there will not be any loss. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are no witnesses, how do we know </span>what was written in the promissory note in order to assess liability? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Let it </span>refer to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who burned the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">trust</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the creditor with regard to the details of the promissory note. Despite the concession of the one who burned the promissory note with regard to the amount of the debt, Rabba holds that he is exempt, since the value of the debt is not inherent in the actual paper.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi bar Ḥanina said: This </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba is </span>the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis. According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value, the one who burned the promissory note <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable. According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not liable. </span>Rabba holds in accordance with the Rabbis, and therefore rules that one who burns a promissory note is exempt from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, objects to this: Say that you heard </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where he damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba. As Rabba says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread before Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and another came and burned it during the festival </span>of Passover, when the leavened bread had already become forbidden, the one who burned it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying the robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">as all are commanded to destroy </span>the leavened bread, and he therefore performed a mitzva. If he burned it <span class="gemarra-regular">after Passover, </span>that is the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis.</span>
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value, the one who burned it is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>and he must pay the robber. Although it is prohibited to derive benefit from leavened bread, the robber could have returned it to the victim and been exempt from liability. Now that it has been burned, the robber will have to pay the monetary value of the leavened bread at the time of the theft. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial </span>loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an item </span>such as a promissory note, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">no intrinsic monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we say </span>that in Rabbi Shimon’s opinion it too is considered to have monetary value?
The Gemara cites a ruling for the case where one burns the promissory note of another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: The one who rules </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action <span class="gemarra-regular">collects, in this </span>case, the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of a proper </span>promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, </span>i.e., the amount of the debt, from the one who burned the promissory note. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who rules </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no liability </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action <span class="gemarra-regular">collects, in this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the paper. </span>The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was an incident </span>like this one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rafram forced Rav Ashi, </span>who had burned a document in his youth, to pay damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he collected </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>if he had damaged <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>crafting <span class="gemarra-regular">a sculpture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he paid him the value of the debt listed in the promissory note.
§ The mishna teaches that if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it, </span>and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>his victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: That which is yours is before you? Rav Ḥisda said: It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 5:4): If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that killed </span>a person and is consequently liable to be stoned, and <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">sentenced it </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the ox, the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>is valid; if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consecration </span>is valid; if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it, its flesh is permitted; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee returned it to its owner, it is returned.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">from when it was sentenced </span>to be stoned it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, and if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sale </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid; if <span class="gemarra-regular">he consecrated it, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consecration </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid; if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered it, its flesh is forbidden; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee returned it to its owner, it is not returned, </span>as once it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, the ox is worthless. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says: Even after it was sentenced, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee returned it to its owner, it is returned.</span>
Rav Ḥisda completes his analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not that they disagree about this </span>issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Ya’akov holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to items from which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> benefit is forbidden </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: That which is yours is before you, and the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot say: That which is yours is before you?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">No. </span>It may be <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> items from which benefit is forbidden </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: That which is yours is before you, </span>and the ruling of the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <span class="gemarra-regular">As if so, </span>i.e., if it were true that the dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Ya’akov concerns the general question of returning an item from which benefit is forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should disagree with regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread on Passover </span>and whether it can be returned as is, since this is a clear case of an item from which benefit is forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba said: Here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to </span>a different issue: Can <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox be sentenced in its absence?</span>
Rabba explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox may not be sentenced in its absence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the bailee is liable to pay. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when the ox is returned after its sentencing, the owner may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had you brought </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>before sentencing, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have chased it away into the marsh, </span>preventing the sentencing from taking place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>since you did not return it to me before it was given to the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have given it to one with whom I cannot litigate, </span>as the court was sure to sentence it. Therefore you must pay me and not return the ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox may be sentenced </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in its absence, </span>and the claim of the owner of the ox is not accepted. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the bailee may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did I do </span>to the ox? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately it would have been sentenced in its absence </span>and rendered forbidden.
The Gemara relates an incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who stated that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ya’akov and not the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">found Rabba bar Shmuel </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you learn anything </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of returning stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">items from which benefit is forbidden? </span>Rabba bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, we learned </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he shall restore the item </span>that he robbed” (Leviticus 5:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “That he robbed”? </span>It means that the robber must <span class="gemarra-regular">return the same </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that he robbed.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a coin and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was invalidated, </span>or of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted, </span>or of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fermented, </span>or of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">became ritually impure, </span>or of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it, </span>or of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal and a sin was performed with it, or </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox that had not been sentenced, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who did you hear say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">before the ox was sentenced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">can be </span>returned, but <span class="gemarra-regular">after it was sentenced it cannot? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Ya’akov in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>This disproves the analysis of Rav Ḥisda, as even the Rabbis agree that an item from which benefit is forbidden is returned as is. Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabba bar Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you find </span>the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not say anything to them,</span> i.e., do not publicize that I erred.
§ The Gemara discusses the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that if one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and it rotted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the robbery victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna (96b): If one robbed another of <span class="gemarra-regular">produce and it rotted, he pays </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery? Rav Pappa said: Here, </span>the mishna is referring to a case where the stolen produce <span class="gemarra-regular">all rotted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which constitutes a significant change. The robber acquires the produce and must pay what its value was at the time of the robbery. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">part of </span>the stolen produce <span class="gemarra-regular">rotted.</span> In such a case the robber may return it and say: That which is yours is before you.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">to craftsmen to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and they damaged </span>them, the craftsmen are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>for the damage. For example, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave a chest, a box, or a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cabine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to a carpenter to fix, and he damaged </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay. And a builder who committed to demolish a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>while demolishing it he <span class="gemarra-regular">broke the stones, or who damaged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he was demolishing on this side </span>of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">fell from another side </span>and caused damage, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>a stone fell and caused damage <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the force of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blow, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one gave a carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet to fix, and he damaged it, the carpenter is liable to pay for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that a carpenter is liable to pay damages <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet to drive a nail into them, </span>i.e., he gave the carpenter complete vessels to repair, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he drove the nail into them and broke them. But </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave wood to a carpenter to build a chest, a box, or a cabinet, and he built a chest, a box, or a cabinet from </span>the wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>before giving it to the owner the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">broke them, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the damage caused to these vessels, and must pay only for the damage caused to the wood.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The craftsman is considered to have acquired the vessel through his work, which enhances its value, and it remains in his possession until he returns it to the owners. Consequently, if he damages the vessel in any way, he is damaging his own item, and must return only the value of the raw materials to the owners.
The Gemara attempts to contradict Rav Asi’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">to craftsmen </span>to fix <span class="gemarra-regular">and they damaged </span>them, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>for the damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gave them wood, </span>and they nevertheless pay the owner the value of a vessel? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to a case where he gave them <span class="gemarra-regular">a chest, a box, or a cabinet </span>to repair.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">a chest, a box, or a cabinet, it may be inferred that the first clause </span>of the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">wood. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: The latter clause <span class="gemarra-regular">is explaining </span>the first clause. After stating that the craftsmen are liable to pay damages, the mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case is it so that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">to craftsmen to fix, and they damaged </span>them, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay? </span>It is with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">gave a carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, it is reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the latter clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches in what </span>case the first clause deems them liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if it enters your mind </span>to think that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is referring to a case where he gave <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">told us </span>that if one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to pay </span>the value of a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of vessels, is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to tell us that if one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">a chest, a box, or a cabinet, </span>the craftsman is liable to pay damages?
The Gemara dismisses this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is due to that </span>reason, i.e., if that is the manner in which the explanation of the mishna is refuted, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>conclusive <span class="gemarra-regular">argument, </span>because that claim can be refuted by saying that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the latter clause to shed light on the first clause, so that you would not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is referring to a case where one gave the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">a chest, a box, or a cabinet, but </span>had he given <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>the carpenter would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case of one who gave a carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">a chest, a box, or a cabinet </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>and it follows <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that the first clause </span>discusses one who gave the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, and even so </span>the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to pay </span>damages. It is therefore impossible to prove Rav Asi’s statement from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that a mishna (100b) <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of Rav Asi: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives wool to a dyer</span>

Daf 99a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and it was burned in the cauldro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in which it was dyed, the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool. </span>The Gemara infers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool, yes, </span>the dyer must pay that amount, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of the wool and its enhanced </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he need not pay. The Gemara suggests: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to a case where the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">was burned after falling </span>into the cauldron and the dye had taken hold, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is enhanced </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel, </span>and therefore the dyer need not pay the enhanced value?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>This is not a proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">was burned at the moment of falling </span>into the cauldron, before the dye had taken hold, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no enhancement. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> be if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was burned after falling </span>into the cauldron, when the dye had taken hold? Would the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>the owner the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and its enhancement? Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel does not accept </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Asi, </span>and holds that a craftsman does not acquire ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel?
The Gemara rejects this statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: With what are we dealing here </span>in the mishna? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the wool and herbs </span>used in the dye both <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to the homeowner, and the dyer is taking </span>only the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment of his hand, </span>i.e., the wages for his labor, and nothing else. In this case, the craftsman does not acquire ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, but in a case where the craftsman provides the materials, he does acquire such rights.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>i.e., if the homeowner’s herbs were also ruined by the dyer, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said that the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool and herbs, </span>not just the value of his wool. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Shmuel is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">dismissing </span>the Gemara’s proof with regard to the statement of Rav Asi that a craftsman acquires a vessel through its enhancement, by saying that the mishna could be understood otherwise. He does not, however, state his own opinion on this matter.
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gave his garment to a craftsman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">concluded </span>the work <span class="gemarra-regular">and notified </span>the owner that the work was complete, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the owner delays paying the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">from now until ten days </span>henceforth, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not violate, for this </span>delay, the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of: </span>“You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him; the wages of a hired worker <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not abide with you all night </span>until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13). If the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the garment <span class="gemarra-regular">to him at midday, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">once the sun has set </span>and the owner has not paid him, the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does violate, for this </span>delay, the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">against delaying </span>the payment of wages.
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel, why does </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">violate </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">against delaying </span>the payment of wages? It is as if the craftsman acquired the garment, and the payment is considered to be a purchase of the garment by the owner, rather than a wage.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stating the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the laundering of a thick garment, where there is no enhancement </span>of the garment. Therefore, the craftsman does not acquire it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, to what </span>end <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the owner of the garment <span class="gemarra-regular">give it to </span>the craftsman? He gave it to him in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to soften </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he has softened it, that is its enhancement, </span>and the craftsman has therefore acquired it. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No;</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">hired </span>the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">for treading</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to forcefully tread on the garment in water until it softens, with the owner paying the craftsman <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span> coin <span class="gemarra-regular">for each tread. </span>The difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">that this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">hired </span>labor, where the craftsman is paid based on the amount of times he performed an action, and not contractual labor, where he is paid based on the outcome, in this case, a softened garment.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to what entered our minds initially, that </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hire </span>the worker <span class="gemarra-regular">for treading </span>but rather he hired him like a craftsman based on the assumption that the garment would be returned laundered, this <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheshet. As they asked Rav Sheshet: </span>If one hires <span class="gemarra-regular">a contractor, </span>who is not paid an hourly wage but is paid upon the completion of his task, and the one who hired him does not pay him on the day that he completes the work, does he <span class="gemarra-regular">violate, for this </span>delay, the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition against delaying </span>the payment of wages, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">not violate </span>the prohibition? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet said to them: </span>He does <span class="gemarra-regular">violate </span>the prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>based on this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Sheshet disagrees with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Asi, </span>who holds that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, and his payment is not considered to be a wage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Aḥa said: </span>Rav Sheshet is discussing a specific type of contractor, and he stated his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an agent </span>tasked with the delivery <span class="gemarra-regular">of a letter, </span>in which case, since the contractor’s only task is to deliver the letter, there is no enhancement through which he might acquire ownership rights. Consequently the prohibition against delaying the payment of wages applies.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the statement of Rav Asi, that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, is the <span class="gemarra-regular">subject of </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a woman gave gold to a goldsmith, instructing him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fashion bracelets, earrings, or rings for me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I will be betrothed to you </span>as payment for your work, then <span class="gemarra-regular">once he has fashioned them she is betrothed; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She is not betrothed until money enters her possession.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>mentioned by the Rabbis? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>i.e., the rings she ordered, then <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference Rabbi Meir </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">money is not </span>required in order for the betrothal to take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with what </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he betroth her? </span>He has given her nothing but the jewelry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is obvious. </span>To <span class="gemarra-regular">what money </span>are the Rabbis referring? They must be referring to when he betroths her via <span class="gemarra-regular">other money, </span>i.e., the payment she owes him for his service. According to the opinion of the Rabbis, in order for the betrothal to take effect he must give her additional money, while according to Rabbi Meir the betrothal takes effect when he gives her the jewelry.
The Gemara prefaces its explanation of the connection to the issue at hand by delineating two assumptions: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>those who say that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis are engaging in a dispute with regard to the issue of a craftsman acquiring ownership rights through the enhancement of a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a wag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is incurred continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning </span>of the period he was hired <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">end, </span>i.e., the obligation to pay for a service begins when the hired party commences work, and the sum owed increases as he proceeds. The fact that he is not paid from the time he commences work establishes the wages as a debt. Consequently, the wages now have the status of a loan. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they also assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a loa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is not betrothed. </span>She therefore cannot be betrothed to him by not having to pay the wages for his work.
Based on these assumptions, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not that they disagree with regard to</span> whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel? As Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman acquires </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel, </span>and since he owns the enhanced value of the vessel, when he gives the jewelry to her he is giving her something valuable of his own, and she is betrothed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman does not acquire </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel, </span>and since a craftsman, in this case, the goldsmith, does not own the jewelry, he cannot betroth a woman with it.
The Gemara rejects this explanation of the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman does not acquire </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel, but here they disagree with regard to </span>the issue of whether the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a wage </span>is incurred continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the beginning </span>of the period he was hired <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">end.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a wage </span>is incurred <span class="gemarra-regular">only at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the end </span>of the period for which he was hired, i.e., the owner is obligated to pay only when the work is complete, and therefore the goldsmith’s wages do not have the status of a loan, but of a sum of money that she becomes obligated to give him at that time. If he gives her the jewelry without asking for that money, it is as though he gave the money from his wages to her, and she may be betrothed with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a wage </span>is incurred continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning </span>of the period he was hired <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">end, </span>and therefore his wages have the status of a loan, and she cannot be betrothed with them and must be given additional money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a wage is </span>incurred continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning </span>of the period he was hired <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> its <span class="gemarra-regular">end, and here they disagree with regard to one who betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a loan. As Rabbi Meir holds </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a loan, she is betrothed. And the Rabbis hold </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a loan, she is not betrothed. </span>

Daf 99b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>another interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>agrees that the obligation to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wage </span>is incurred continuously <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning </span>of the period a craftsman is hired <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">end; and everyone </span>agrees that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betroths</span> a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with a loan, she is not betrothed; and everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">a craftsman does not acquire </span>ownership rights <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement of the vessel.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he added a jewel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nofekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his own for her. Rabbi Meir holds </span>that if a man betroths a woman with <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan and one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her mind is </span>focused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, in this case the jewel serves as the betrothal money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that if a man betroths a woman with <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan and one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her mind is </span>focused <span class="gemarra-regular">on the loan, </span>so the loan serves as the betrothal money, and if one betroths a woman with a loan, she is not betrothed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">in the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <span class="gemarra-regular">with the payment for which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed, </span>as the payment is a loan, since she already owes him this money. But if he says: Be betrothed to me <span class="gemarra-regular">with the payment for which I will work for you, she is betrothed, </span>as from the moment he is entitled to the money, he gives it to her for her betrothal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: </span>If he says: Be betrothed to me <span class="gemarra-regular">with the payment for which I will work for you, she is not betrothed, </span>as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that upon the completion of the labor it is a loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all the more so </span>if he says: Be betrothed to me <span class="gemarra-regular">with the payment for which I have worked for you.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites a third opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually they said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">With the payment for which I have worke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, or whether </span>he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">With the payment for which I will work for you, she is not betrothed. But if he added a jewel of his own for her, she is betrothed.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">is there between the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Natan? </span>The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span> is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wage: </span>Is the obligation incurred continuously or only upon the completion of the work? The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi </span>is the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan and one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Natan holds that if a man betroths a woman with a loan and one <span class="it-text">peruta</span> her mind is focused on the loan, and in this case his jewel is disregarded; and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that her mind is focused on the <span class="it-text">peruta</span>, in this case the jewel, and she is betrothed with the jewel.
§ The Gemara now returns to the topic of a craftsman who damages the item with which he is working. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: An expert butcher who damaged </span>an animal by slaughtering it incorrectly, thereby rendering it non-kosher, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>the owner of the animal for the damage. Why? <span class="gemarra-regular">He is one who causes damage; he is negligent; he is like one who is told </span>by the animal’s owner to <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it from here, </span>i.e., the area of the throat where ritual slaughter is performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he slaughtered it from there, </span>i.e., a different area of the throat, in violation of the owner’s wishes.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why must he say </span>both that the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">is one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who causes damage </span>and that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is negligent? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>Shmuel had <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>only that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is one who causes damage, I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>applies only in a case where the butcher slaughtered the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for pay, </span>in which case, due to the extra responsibility that he bears, he is considered to be one who caused damage and is liable to pay even in a case where the damage was unintentional; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does </span>the work <span class="gemarra-regular">for free, </span>I would say <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he is exempt from liability in a case where the damage was unintentional. Shmuel therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">is negligent, </span>and one who works without pay is analogous to an unpaid bailee, who is liable to pay for damage caused by negligence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama bar Gurya raised an objection to Shmuel </span>from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (10:10): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives an animal to a butcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the butcher killed it in a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered it an animal carcass, </span>if the butcher is <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert, </span>then he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from liability; if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>person, without particular expertise in the act of ritual slaughter, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And if </span>the owner of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>the butcher, then regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>person or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert, </span>the butcher is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage. This indicates that an expert butcher who slaughtered the animal improperly is exempt if he slaughtered it without pay. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: May your mind be muddle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for raising a ridiculous objection.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One of the Sages came and raised </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">objection to </span>Shmuel. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Now you shall receive what your friend received </span>from me, since <span class="gemarra-regular">I say to you </span>my statement in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and you say to me, </span>i.e., you raise an objection, based upon the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. Why were you not precise </span>in your consideration of <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>choice of <span class="gemarra-regular">words? As I say: He is one who causes damage; he is negligent; he is like one who is told </span>by the animal’s owner to <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it from here, and he slaughtered it from there. Who accepts this reasoning? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says: He should have taken upon himself </span>the responsibility to perform his task properly, and if he did not, he is liable to pay for the damage that he caused. The other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who exempt him from liability.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>is Shmuel referring to? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>that is difficult. Parenthetically, the Gemara states that the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span> serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the three statements of Rabbi Meir that will be cited. It stands for: He tied it [<span class="it-text">kesharo</span>], to dye [<span class="it-text">litzboa</span>], and broke [<span class="it-text">nishbera</span>].
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (45b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>ox’s <span class="gemarra-regular">owner tied it with reins </span>to a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">or locked </span>the gate <span class="gemarra-regular">before it in an appropriate manner, but </span>nevertheless the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged and caused damage, whether </span>the ox is <span class="gemarra-regular">innocuous or forewarned </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>since this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>As the Gemara explains on 45b, Rabbi Meir holds that a forewarned ox requires a heightened level of safeguarding, and since the owner did not safeguard it, he is liable. The same would apply here, that one who agrees to perform a task must exercise care in executing it. Otherwise, he will be held liable to pay for damage.
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the statement of Rabbi Meir that Shmuel was referring to: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in that mishna, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the interpretation of biblical <span class="gemarra-regular">verses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not logical reasoning, as the Gemara explains there, and conclusions cannot be drawn from that <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to this one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>that Shmuel is referring to, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">red for him, and he dyed it black, </span>or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black, and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of his wool, </span>indicating that he is liable to pay for the damage. The Gemara rejects this opinion: This statement also does not prove that according to Rabbi Meir a worker is liable to pay for a job performed improperly, since <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>the wool, thereby removing it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>that Shmuel is referring to, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">jug broke </span>on the road <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not remove it, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">his camel fell </span>on the road <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not stand it up, Rabbi Meir says: He is liable for the damage </span>that they cause, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis say: He is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we maintain </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the question of whether <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stumbles is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">negligent. </span>According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, one who stumbles is considered negligent, since he should have paid attention while walking. He is therefore liable for whatever damage he causes. In the case of an expert butcher as well, Rabbi Meir holds that he is considered negligent when damaging the animal he slaughtered, and the Rabbis hold that he is not negligent and therefore exempt from liability.
The Gemara discusses Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion concerning the case of an expert butcher. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: An expert butcher who damaged </span>an animal by slaughtering it incorrectly, thereby rendering it non-kosher, is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the owner of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even if he is as expert as the butchers of Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is not considered an accident, and he is considered to be at fault. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was an incident </span>in which a butcher who damaged an animal was brought to court <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the synagogue of </span>the town <span class="gemarra-regular">Maon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the butcher: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go bring proof that you are an exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">chickens, and I will exempt you </span>from payment.
The Gemara responds: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the aforementioned incident, the butcher slaughtered the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for free, </span>and he is therefore exempt, while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s previous statement, he slaughtered the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">for pay, </span>and is therefore liable to pay for the damage. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with that which Rabbi Zeira says: One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wants a butcher to be liable to </span>pay <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>in the event that he damages the animal during slaughter should <span class="gemarra-regular">advance him a dinar, </span>so that he is paid for his services, and he is consequently liable to pay damages.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (10:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who brought wheat </span>to another <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind </span>for him, and the miller <span class="gemarra-regular">did not wet </span>the grains sufficiently for the grinding to be performed effectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he converted </span>the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">into bra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or coarse bran; </span>or if one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">flour to the baker and he made bread </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">underbake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and tends to crumble; or if one gave <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal to a butcher and </span>the butcher killed it in a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered it </span>an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass, </span>the worker is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, because he is like a paid bailee. </span>This indicates that even if the work was done for free, the worker has the legal status of one who is paid, and he is liable to pay for the damage. The Gemara answers by emending the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he is a paid bailee </span>and actually receives payment.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>animal that was <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>with an incision <span class="gemarra-regular">not in the nec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was brought before Rav. </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">declared it non-kosher, and exempted the butcher from paying its value. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi encountered that man, </span>i.e., the owner of the animal, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him: Rav did two for you.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>are the <span class="gemarra-regular">two? If we say </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two unfavorable </span>rulings, what are they? One is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have declared </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">kosher, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who says that an animal that has been slaughtered in this manner is kosher, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>instead he <span class="gemarra-regular">declared it non-kosher, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that it is not kosher. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the second is that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, he should have </span>ruled that <span class="gemarra-regular">the butcher </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damage. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if these are the two that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi are referring to, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it permitted </span>for them <span class="gemarra-regular">to say this type </span>of statement to the owner of the animal?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>a judge <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves </span>the courthouse, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not say </span>to the litigant: <span class="gemarra-regular">I found you innocen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and my colleagues found you liable, but what can I do, since my colleagues outnumber me? And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>a circumstance such as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; </span>but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the intention is that they told him that there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two favorable </span>rulings: First, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>by declaring the animal to be non-kosher, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not allow you to eat </span>an item about which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, and </span>second, by exempting the butcher from paying you, <span class="gemarra-regular">he prevented you </span>from being in a situation where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether receiving payment from the butcher constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, </span>since you would have been given the butcher’s money when he may be exempt, as the animal may in fact be kosher.
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of an expert who erred, thereby causing a loss. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who presents a dinar to a money change</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to assess its value or authenticity and the money changer declares it valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, </span>i.e., invalid, causing its owner a monetary loss, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the money changer is <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>person he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable. And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that irrespective of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ordinary </span>person, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the owner’s loss.
To reconcile the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: When </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert is exempt </span>from liability, it is referring to renowned experts <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>the money changers <span class="gemarra-regular">Dankhu and Issur, </span>whose expertise is so great <span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not need to learn </span>about assessing currency <span class="gemarra-regular">at all. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if they are so proficient, <span class="gemarra-regular">in what did they err? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They erred with regard to </span>a coin from <span class="gemarra-regular">a new press</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which at that time was leaving the press, </span>and they did not know its value.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who presented a dinar to Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>to assess its authenticity. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: It is a proper </span>coin. <span class="gemarra-regular">The next day she came before him and said to him: I presented it </span>to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they told me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a bad </span>dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not </span>able to <span class="gemarra-regular">spend it. </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav: Go exchange it for her, and write on my tablet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apinkasi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> This </span>was a <span class="gemarra-regular">bad transaction, </span>as I should not have assessed the coin.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Dankhu and Issur, who are exempt due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not need to learn </span>about assessing currency? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya too did not need to learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he was also an expert. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>was not actually required to return a dinar to this woman, but when he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">he acted beyond the letter of the law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught </span>concerning the verse: “And you shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do” (Exodus 18:20): <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall show them”; this </span>is referring to

Daf 100a

<span class="gemarra-regular">the core of their existence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Torah study, which is the source of life. <span class="gemarra-regular">“The way”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">acts of kindness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “They must walk”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">visiting the sick. “Wherein”; this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">burial </span>of the dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">“The work”; this </span>is referring to conducting oneself in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the law. “That they must do”; this </span>is referring to conducting oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the letter of the law. </span>This indicates that the Torah mandates that people conduct themselves beyond the letter of the law.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish presented a dinar to Rabbi Elazar </span>so that the latter would assess it. Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is a proper </span>coin. Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Realize that I am relying on you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What </span>is the purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">of stating that you are relying on me? </span>Is it so <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>this dinar <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, I will be required to exchange it for you </span>with a good dinar? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">you who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rabbi Meir </span>who is of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">liability</span> for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action, even if he did not directly cause damage to the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that you intended to say: This is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, but we do not hold in accordance with his </span>opinion?
Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>I intended to say that this is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">hold in accordance with his </span>opinion.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>is Rabbi Elazar referring to? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>that is difficult. Parenthetically, the Gemara states that the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">dalet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peh</span> serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device for the four statements of Rabbi Meir that will be cited. It stands for: Judged [<span class="it-text">dan</span>], to dye [<span class="it-text">litzboa</span>], covers [<span class="it-text">mesakekh</span>], and broke open [<span class="it-text">pirtza</span>].
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 28b): If a judge <span class="gemarra-regular">issued a judgmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and erred, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquitted </span>one who was in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed liable </span>one who should have in fact been <span class="gemarra-regular">acquitted, </span>or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pure </span>item is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure </span>item is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">what he did is done, </span>i.e., the judgment stands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the judge <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from his home, </span>i.e., from his personal funds. He is therefore liable to pay the damages even though he caused the loss indirectly.
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the statement of Rabbi Meir that Shmuel was referring to: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</span> mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ile’a says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: And this </span>mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the money from the one whom he found liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave </span>it to the other party <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is not a case of causation but of direct action.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir, as we learned </span>in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">red for him, and he dyed it black, </span>or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black, and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of his wool. </span>The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <span class="gemarra-regular">there he does </span>cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 7:4): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drapes his grapevin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> atop another’s grain has rendered </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the prohibition against growing diverse kinds in a vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to pay the owner of the grain for the damage. The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <span class="gemarra-regular">there too he does </span>cause damage <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 3:3): If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition of a vineyard </span>that is adjacent to a wheat field, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>partition <span class="gemarra-regular">broke open, </span>

Daf 100b

the owner of the wheat field may <span class="gemarra-regular">tell</span> the owner of the vineyard to <span class="gemarra-regular">repair </span>the breach before the vines intermingle with the grain and cause it to become forbidden. If the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">broke open </span>again, he may again <span class="gemarra-regular">tell him </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">repair </span>it. If the owner of the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">abandoned </span>the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not repair it, he has rendered </span>the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and is obligated </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">restitution </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This demonstrates that one is liable to pay damages even if he did not perform any action at all, and consequently proves that Rabbi Meir rules there is liability for damage caused by indirect action.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to a dyer and it was burned in the cauldron </span>during the dyeing process, thereby completely ruining the wool so that there is no enhancement, only loss, the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of his wool. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed it unattractively [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ka’ur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> so that the dye is not absorbed well by the wool, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the enhancement, </span>i.e., the amount that the value of the wool has increased by being dyed, <span class="gemarra-regular">exceeds the </span>dyer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the owner of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement, he gives him </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement.</span>
If the owner gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">red for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">he dyed it black</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives</span> the owner of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of his wool. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Here too, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement exceeds the </span>dyer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses, </span>the owner of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the mishna mean by <span class="gemarra-regular">unattractively? Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kelabus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-italic">kelabus</span> mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Shmuel said: </span>

Daf 101a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The sediments </span>of dye in <span class="gemarra-regular">the cauldrons, </span>that is, the dyer took the dye remaining in the cauldron from previous use, and used that dye for this garment, leading to an inferior result.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives wood to a carpente</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to fashion a chair from it and he fashioned a bench from it </span>instead, or one who gives him wood to fashion <span class="gemarra-regular">a bench and he fashioned a chair from it </span>instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>The carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him the value of his wood </span>and keeps the chair or bench, as he has acquired it due to the change. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>He does not acquire the item. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the value of the wood’s <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement exceeds the </span>carpenter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">the expenses, and if the expenses exceed the enhancement </span>of the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement. </span>Since the carpenter deviated from the customer’s order, he is entitled to either his expenses or the enhancement, the smaller amount of the two.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Meir concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he gave wood to a carpenter to fashion a beautiful chair from it and he fashioned an ugly chair from it, </span>or to fashion <span class="gemarra-regular">a beautiful bench </span>from it <span class="gemarra-regular">and he fashioned an ugly bench </span>from it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the value of the wood’s <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement exceeds the </span>carpenter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">expenses </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the carpenter <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of the expenses, and if the expenses exceed the enhancement he gives him the value of the enhancement. </span>Since the carpenter did not deviate significantly from the customer’s instructions, Rabbi Meir concedes that the carpenter does not acquire the item due to the change.
§ In connection with the discussion of the halakhic implications of the enhancement of a garment quoted above, the Gemara records that <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: What is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? That <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to the woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">substantive, </span>i.e., the dye is considered a separate entity from the wool it dyed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wool </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not substantive, </span>i.e., the dye does not remain an independent entity, and it is viewed as if there is only colored wool?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which this dilemma is relevant? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>the dilemma arises <span class="gemarra-regular">where one robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">pigments, and ground them </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">and soaked them </span>in water, converting them into dye, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed </span>wool <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, </span>then the dilemma would be concerning how the robber returns the pigments. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the pigments <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a change </span>of form, which occurred when he ground the pigments, and in any event will be obligated to return the value of the pigments at the time of the robbery.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to resolve the dilemma in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">pigments </span>that had already been <span class="gemarra-regular">soaked </span>in water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed </span>wool <span class="gemarra-regular">with them. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> here? Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool substantive, </span>i.e., a separate entity, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the robber: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my dyes that you took? Or perhaps the enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wool </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not substantive, </span>but becomes one with the wool, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the robber can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have nothing at all of yours, </span>since the dyes are no longer considered extant.
The Gemara rejects this understanding of the application of the dilemma. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool is not substantive, can </span>the robber really <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I have nothing at all of yours? Let </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Give me my dyes that you have </span>caused to be <span class="gemarra-regular">lost. </span>Even if the dyes are no longer considered extant, the owner is still entitled to monetary compensation for the robbery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the dilemma is relevant <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">side </span>of the question: Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wool is not substantive, and </span>therefore the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">needs </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay him? Or perhaps </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool is substantive, and </span>the robber can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>The dyes absorbed into the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">lie before you; take them. </span>The Gemara rejects this as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take them? With what </span>should he <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the dyes, <span class="gemarra-regular">with soap?</span> While <span class="gemarra-regular">soap does remove </span>dye from the wool, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not return </span>the dye to the robbery victim, as the dye cannot be recovered.
The Gemara suggests another scenario: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he robbed one </span>person of <span class="gemarra-regular">wool and dyes, and dyed that wool with those dyes, and he is returning the </span>dyed <span class="gemarra-regular">wool to him. </span>The dilemma is: Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to the wool is substantive, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">returning </span>both the <span class="gemarra-regular">dye and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool to him? Or perhaps enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool is not substantive, and </span>it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">the wool </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is returning to him, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not returning the dye to him, </span>since it is no longer extant.
The Gemara rejects this understanding of the application of the dilemma as well. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case based on the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he increased the value </span>of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>as dyed wool is more expensive than undyed wool. Consequently, even if the robber has not returned the dye, he reimburses the owner for it when he returns the appreciated wool. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to resolve the dilemma in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cost of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dye has depreciated. </span>If the dye is viewed as an independent entity the robber is returning both the wool and the dye. If it is not, he must reimburse the robbery victim for the value of the dye at the time of the robbery. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: The dilemma is relevant in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he robbed another of dye and a basket, and <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">basket with </span>the dye, in which case the dye does not increase the value of the dyed item.
The Gemara presents an alternative understanding of the case where the dilemma applies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">wool that </span>belonged to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and dyes that </span>belonged to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a monkey came and dyed that wool with those dyes. </span>The dilemma is as follows: Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye </span>provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool is substantive, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the owner of the dye can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the wool: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me my dyes that are with you? Or perhaps enhancement </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">dye</span> provides <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wool is not substantive and </span>the owner of the wool can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the dye: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is nothing </span>of yours <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, </span>and he is exempt from liability because the dyes are no longer extant.
Having determined the scenario in which the dilemma is relevant, the Gemara proceeds to resolve the dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Orla</span> 3:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">A garment that one dyed with </span>dye extracted from <span class="gemarra-regular">peels of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree during its first three years, <span class="gemarra-regular">must be burned, </span>as it is prohibited to derive benefit from <span class="it-text">orla</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the enhancement of an item’s <span class="gemarra-regular">appearance is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>and the dye therefore remains an independent substance even after having been absorbed by the wool.
The Gemara rejects this resolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The reason the garment must be burned is not because the dye remains an independent substance. Rather, it is because <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah prohibited benefit that is visible to the eye, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">areilim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to you; <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall not be eaten” </span>(Leviticus 19:23). From this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a prohibition </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">eating </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not</span> even derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not dye with </span>dyes extracted from the fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not light a lamp with </span>oil extracted from the fruit? 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orlato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] as forbidden [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">araltem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Three years shall it be as <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">areilim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to you; <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall not be eaten” </span>(Leviticus 19:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all these </span>types of benefit in the prohibition. Consequently, there is an explicit derivation that an item dyed with <span class="it-text">orla</span> dye is forbidden.
The Gemara attempts another resolution of the dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A garment that one dyed with </span>dye extracted from <span class="gemarra-regular">the peels of </span>produce from the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year must be <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>when the time for the elimination of Sabbatical Year produce arrives. This indicates that the dye evidently remains an independent substance. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, as the verse states: “Shall </span>all the increase thereof <span class="gemarra-regular">be” </span>(Leviticus 25:7), and the phrase: “Shall be,” teaches that it <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">remain as it is, </span>i.e., it retains its status as Sabbatical Year produce despite any change to its form. 

Daf 101b

The Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a contradiction: We learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Orla</span> 3:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">A garment that one dyed with </span>dye extracted from <span class="gemarra-regular">peels of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must be burned. Apparently, </span>the change in <span class="gemarra-regular">appearance </span>precipitated by the <span class="it-text">orla</span> peels <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered a significant <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>and the dye retains its status as <span class="it-text">orla</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raise a contradiction </span>from another mishna (<span class="it-text">Oholot</span> 3:2): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of bloo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">that was absorbed in </span>the floor of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> every vessel in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house is ritually impure </span>by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that any vessel in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house is ritually pure. And </span>these two statements <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> first statement was <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to vessels that were </span>in the house <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset, </span>before the blood was absorbed; and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>second statement was <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to vessels that came </span>into the house <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end, </span>after the blood had already been absorbed.
The mishna continues: If the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">was absorbed in a garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">examined, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if the garment is washed and a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of blood emerges from it, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is ritually impure, </span>and the garment imparts ritual impurity to the vessels in the house as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, </span>i.e., if less than a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> of blood emerges, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">is pure, </span>and it does not impart impurity. Apparently, only the blood that can be removed from the garment is considered blood, while the blood absorbed in the garment is insignificant. If this is the case, the change in appearance precipitated by the blood is not considered a significant matter, and the blood absorbed in the garment does not remain an independent substance.
The Gemara presents an answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: </span>A <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies </span>applied to the measurements <span class="gemarra-regular">of a quarter</span>-<span class="it-text">log</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught here, </span>as the mishna is written <span class="gemarra-regular">in reference to the blood of submissio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that is discharged from a body at the time of death, and such blood is ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, </span>but in general, a change in appearance precipitated by blood is significant.
§ Having cited a contradiction raised by Rava, the Gemara proceeds to cite another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction. We learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 7:1): Concerning plants <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">the species that </span>are used as <span class="gemarra-regular">dyes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for example the <span class="gemarra-italic">sefiḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., produce that grew without being intentionally planted, <span class="gemarra-regular">of woa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and safflower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they have </span>sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">and money </span>exchanged for <span class="gemarra-regular">them has </span>sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year. Additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">eradication</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and money </span>exchanged for <span class="gemarra-regular">them is </span>subject to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">eradication. Apparently, wood, </span>a type of inedible growth, <span class="gemarra-regular">is subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical </span>Year despite the fact that it is not edible.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And raise a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">reed leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and vine leaves that one piled for storag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the field, </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered them for eating, they are subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical </span>Year; if he gathered them <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>use as <span class="gemarra-regular">wood, </span>e.g., for kindling a fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical </span>Year. Apparently, wood or any other non-food product is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">answers </span>the contradiction, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And the Sabbath produce of the land shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">for food </span>for you” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to those </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">whose benefit and whose consumption coincide, </span>as is the case with regard to food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wood is excluded, as its benefit follows its consumption.</span> The primary purpose of kindling wood is not accomplished with the burning of the wood; rather, it is with the charcoal that heats the oven. Therefore, wood is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there wood </span>that is used to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">heat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose benefit coincides with its consumption,</span> as one enjoys the warmth provided by the fire while the wood is burned?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>

Daf 102a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Unspecified wood exists for fuel, </span>i.e., charcoal, so its benefit follows its consumption.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana says: And </span>the matter of whether <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling wood, </span>whose benefit follows its consumption, is subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute among the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 6:25): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not transfer Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., wine, to another person; <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for soaking </span>flax to prepare it for spinning, as the benefit derived from the flax follows its soaking, when the soaked and spun thread is woven into a garment; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor or for launderin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> with it, as the benefit derived follows the laundering when one wears the clean clothes. Soaking the flax or laundering the garment in wine is considered the consumption of the wine, as it is no longer potable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: One may transfer </span>to another <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">produce for soaking and for laundering.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning </span>for the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis? The verse states </span>with regard to Sabbatical Year produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For food” </span>(Leviticus 25:6), from which it is inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not for soaking; “for food,” but not for laundering. And Rabbi Yosei says </span>that it is permitted, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “For you,”</span> from which it is inferred: For you, <span class="gemarra-regular">for all your needs, </span>even for soaking and for laundering.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis as well, isn’t it written: “For you”? </span>How do they explain that term? The Gemara answers: From that term “for you” it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For you,” similar to “for food,” </span>i.e., the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to those </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">whose benefit and whose consumption coincide, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes soaking and laundering, where </span>the items’ <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit follows their consumption.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei as well, isn’t it written: “For food”? </span>Rabbi Yosei could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: That </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For food,” but not for a poultice [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">melogema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say “for food” but not for a poultice, or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it is only “for food” but not for laundering? When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “For you,” laundering is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>as permitted since it includes all of one’s bodily needs. <span class="gemarra-regular">How do I realize </span>the meaning of that which the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For food”? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">“for food” but not for a poultice.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. Should one ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did you see </span>that led you <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the </span>use of Sabbatical Year produce for <span class="gemarra-regular">laundering and to exclude the </span>use of Sabbatical Year produce as <span class="gemarra-regular">a poultice? </span>Perhaps the opposite should be said. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">I include the </span>use for <span class="gemarra-regular">laundering, which </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">equally to every person, </span>as everyone needs clean clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I exclude the </span>use as <span class="gemarra-regular">a poultice, which </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">equally to every person; </span>it is only for the ill wounded.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to Sabbatical Year produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For food,” but not for a poultice; “for food,” but not for sprinklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> wine in one’s house to provide a pleasant fragrance; <span class="gemarra-regular">“for food,” but not to make an emetic [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apiktevizin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it </span>to induce vomiting? <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as, if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, is there </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">also soaking and laundering </span>that should have been excluded from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as in the Rabbis’ opinion the use of Sabbatical Year produce for those purposes is forbidden?
§ The mishna (100b) teaches that if the owner gave wool to a dyer to dye it red and instead he dyed it black, Rabbi Meir says: The dyer gives the owner of the wool the value of his wool. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: If </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement </span>exceeds the dyer’s expenses, the owner of the wool gives the dyer the expenses. If the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him the value of the enhancement. The Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>device, the acrostic <span class="gemarra-italic">saban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for the names of the Sages involved in the following incident; each letter in the acrostic represents the middle letter of one of the names: <span class="it-text">Samekh</span>, Rav Yosef; <span class="it-text">beit</span>, Rabbi Abba; <span class="it-text">nun</span>, Rav Huna. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef was sitting behind Rabbi Abba, </span>and they were both sitting <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Huna. And Rav Huna was sitting and saying: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef turned his face </span>in disdain of Rav Huna’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: Granted, </span>stating that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa is necessary, </span>as it would <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that there is a principle that when there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">many, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the many. </span>Rav Huna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in this case the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, despite the fact that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual.</span>
The Gemara interrupts Rav Yosef’s remark and asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa </span>to which Rav Huna is referring? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan with </span>a promissory <span class="gemarra-regular">note, one may not collec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the loan <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>gentiles near the time of their holidays, but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>agreement, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may collect from </span>gentiles even near the time of their holidays, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the creditor is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as one who salvages </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from their possession.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the statement that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, why do I </span>need it? This <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>an example of the Mishna recording <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute, and afterward </span>recording only one side of that dispute as <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed opinion. And </span>the principle is that when the Mishna records <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute, and afterward </span>records only one side of that dispute as <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed opinion, </span>then the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the unattributed opinion.</span>
The Gemara identifies the dispute and the unattributed mishna. The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Bava</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Kamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If one gave wool to a dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to dye </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">red for him and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">he dyed it black, </span>or to dye it <span class="gemarra-regular">black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The dyer <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the owner of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of his wool. Rabbi Yehuda says: If </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement exceeds the expenses, </span>the owner of the wool <span class="gemarra-regular">gives the expenses to </span>the dyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the enhancement. And the unattributed </span>mishna appears <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Bava</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Metzia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned </span>in a mishna there (76a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever changes </span>from the terms of an agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">is at a disadvantage, and whoever renege</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>an agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">is at a disadvantage. </span>This unattributed mishna accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that a craftsman who deviates from his assignment receives either the expenses or the enhancement, whichever is of lesser value.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>being that this is a dispute and afterward an unattributed opinion, why did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>find it necessary to state that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is necessary, </span>as it would <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Mishna is not sequential and, </span>in fact, this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">followed by a dispute. And </span>why does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>disagree? He disagrees because <span class="gemarra-regular">if that is so, </span>then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>is recorded <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward an unattributed </span>opinion is recorded, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say: The Mishna is not sequential, and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">followed by a dispute.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna </span>would respond: The situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Mishna is not sequential, </span>i.e., where we say that the Mishna is sequential, is only when both <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> appear <span class="gemarra-regular">in one tractate, but </span>when they appear <span class="gemarra-regular">in two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">tractates we say </span>that the Mishna is not sequential. Since these <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> are found in two different tractates, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> and <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span>, the assumption is that the Mishna is not sequential. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef </span>would respond: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nezikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span>, and <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is one tractate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that even if <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> and <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> are to be considered two separate tractates, Rav Yosef would still hold that Rav Huna’s statement was unnecessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>as one of a pair <span class="gemarra-regular">of established </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Whoever changes</span> from the terms of an agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">is at a disadvantage, and whoever reneges </span>on an agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">is at a disadvantage. </span>Since this ruling was taught with another, established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it is apparent that this is also an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
§ The Gemara notes another dispute concerning one who deviates from the terms of an agreement. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 4:20): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who gives money to his agent</span>

Daf 102b

<span class="gemarra-regular">to purchase wheat for him, </span>which he plans to sell at a profit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>instead the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased barley with </span>the money, or if he gave his agent money to purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">barley and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">he purchased wheat with </span>the money, two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> issue discordant rulings with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there was a loss</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the loss is for </span>the agent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if there was a profit, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">profit is for </span>the agent as well, as he is considered to have abrogated his status as an agent by deviating from the instructions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 4:20) that if there was an agreement that both parties would split the profits from the transaction, <span class="gemarra-regular">if there was a loss, the loss is for </span>the agent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if there was a profit, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">profit </span>goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the middle,</span> i.e., the agent and the investor split the profit.
To reconcile the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and this </span>second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains his rationale: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>by an agent that deviates from the terms of his assignment means that the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the item in question for himself, as in the case of one who was paid to dye wool red but dyed it black. In this case as well, when the agent purchases wheat instead of barley, or vice versa, he acquires the grain for himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a change </span>by an agent which deviates from the terms of his assignment does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the item in question for himself. It is acquired by the one who appointed the agent, and they split the profits as agreed. But the agent is held responsible for any loss incurred, due to his deviation from the instructions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you say that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda extends to the case of these <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabbi Meir says </span>that a change by an agent from the terms of his assignment results in the acquisition of the item by the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to an item that is fit for </span>use by the one who appointed the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">himself, </span>such as wool dyed the wrong color, which is now not usable for its intended purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say </span>his ruling with regard to an item purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>subsequent sale as <span class="gemarra-regular">merchandise, </span>since it is intended to be sold for a profit in any event, and the transaction would take effect as agreed upon initially, with the agent held responsible for any loss incurred.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Elazar said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are written in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is discussing grain purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">for eating, </span>and since the one who appointed the agent desired wheat, he does not acquire the barley. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is discussing grain purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>subsequent sale as <span class="gemarra-regular">merchandise, </span>and the transaction takes effect as agreed upon initially, with the agent held responsible for any loss incurred.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">they laughed at it in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, at the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who said that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>a deviation by an agent from the terms of his assignment does not result in the acquisition of the item for the agent himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">And who informed the owner of the wheat, </span>i.e., the seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should transfer the wheat to the owner of the money? </span>If the seller was unaware that the agent was acting on someone else’s behalf, how would the one who appointed the agent acquire the wheat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Sasrati objects to this </span>rationale: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where the agent was sent to purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and </span>he purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one who appointed the agent should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>acquire the wheat, since the seller was unaware that the agent was acting on someone else’s behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said: </span>The case of an agent who was assigned to purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and </span>purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat is different, as </span>the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">is performing his assignment and, </span>as such, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is like the customer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the one who appointed him, and it is as though the latter has purchased the grain himself.
Rabbi Abbahu further explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that the agent is viewed as an extension of the one who appointed him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 24a): Concerning both <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates his propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one who valuates himself </span>by donating his fixed value to the Temple, the Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> any rights <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the donor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife’s clothing; and not with regard to his children’s clothing; and not with regard to </span>new clothes colored with <span class="gemarra-regular">dye that the </span>donor <span class="gemarra-regular">dyed for </span>his wife or children; <span class="gemarra-regular">and not with regard to new sandal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that</span> the donor <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased for </span>his wife or children. Presumably, the treasurer has no right to these items because they are for the personal use of the donor’s wife and children, and are considered as if owned by them.
Rabbi Abbahu continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>is it so, i.e., why is it that the wife is considered the owner of the dyed clothing for which the husband paid? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also, let </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Who informed the dyer that he should transfer his dye to the wife? Rather, is it not because we say that </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is performing his assignment and, </span>as such, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>an extension of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife’s hand? Here also, </span>in the case of one who purchases grain for another, the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">is performing his assignment, and is like </span>an extension of the <span class="gemarra-regular">customer’s hand.</span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: No, </span>the reason for the ruling of the mishna is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the intention of anyone who consecrates his property is not upon the clothing of his wife and his children, </span>i.e., he does not intend to consecrate those items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira objects to </span>Rabbi Abba’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is it the intention of a person </span>who consecrates his property to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">upon his phylacteries? </span>Presumably not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 23b) that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">his property, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries are evaluated for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and consecrated. Apparently, lack of intent to consecrate a particular item does not prevent its consecration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabbi Zeira: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, the intention of a person </span>who consecrates his property <span class="gemarra-regular">is upon </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates his property thinks </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am performing a mitzva, </span>and he therefore intends to include his phylacteries; <span class="gemarra-regular">but the intention of a person is not upon the clothing of his wife and his children, due to the enmity </span>that would be engendered if he consecrated their clothing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Oshaya </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">objects to </span>Rabbi Abba’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it not </span>so that the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">those who are obligated in valuations was taught here </span>in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Arakhin</span> 21a): Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">those who are obligated in valuations, </span>the Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">seizes collateral from them </span>to force them to fulfill their vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And is the intention of a person upon himself </span>to allow the treasurer <span class="gemarra-regular">to seize collateral from him? </span>Presumably not. Nevertheless, collateral is seized from him, proving that one’s intention does not prevent consecration. Accordingly, even if it is assumed that he does not intend to consecrate the clothing of his wife or children, the clothing should nevertheless be consecrated. Why, then, is the clothing of his wife or children not consecrated?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Abba </span>also holds that the reason the clothing is not consecrated is not due to his intent, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who consecrates his property becomes as one who transferred his wife’s and his children’s clothing to them at the outset. </span>Therefore, the clothing did not belong to him at the time that he consecrated his property.
§ The Gemara presents another situation in which one makes a purchase involving a third party. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field in the name of another, he is not compelled to sell </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to him </span>at the time of the sale: I will purchase the field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that he will sell it to me, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is compelled to sell </span>it.
Noting the ambiguity of this statement, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying? Rav Sheshet said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field from another, </span>claiming that he is acting <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of the Exilarc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> or another dominant figure, so that others will be discouraged from contesting the sale, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch is not compelled to sell </span>it to him, i.e., the Exilarch is not required to provide the purchaser with documentation that the field belongs to the purchaser. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the seller: I will purchase the field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that the Exilarch will provide me with that documentation, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch is compelled to sell </span>it to him, i.e., to provide him with the documentation.
The Gemara questions Rav Sheshet’s interpretation. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field in the name of the Exilarch, the Exilarch is not compelled to sell </span>it to him. Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches only that the Exilarch is not required to provide the purchaser with documentation that the field is his, it can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Let us say that </span>this interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: And who informed the owner of the wheat that he should transfer the wheat to the customer? </span>Since the seller assumed he was selling the field to the Exilarch, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael would hold that the sale does not take effect. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to this </span>inference that it is surmised that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in conflict with the opinion of the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as it can be said that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">informed the owner of the field and informed the witnesses </span>that he intends to purchase the field for himself.
The Gemara rejects Rav Sheshet’s interpretation for a different reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>is difficult, as it states that if the purchaser said to the seller: I will purchase the field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that the Exilarch will sell it to me, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch is compelled to sell </span>it to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why</span> should the Exilarch be compelled to provide the purchaser with documentation? <span class="gemarra-regular">But let the Exilarch say: I do not desire your esteem nor do I desire your disgrace, </span>i.e., I am not involved in your affairs. Since the Exilarch had not been party to the negotiations, how can a stipulation stated by the purchaser render him obligated?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field in the name of his friend, the Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 103a

<span class="gemarra-regular">the seller is not compelle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sell </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">another time, </span>i.e., to provide the purchaser with a document denoting him as the owner of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to him: </span>I will purchase the field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the conditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that you will provide a deed in my name, <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller is compelled to sell </span>the field again, i.e., to provide the purchaser with a document denoting him as the owner.
The Gemara clarifies the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases a field in the name of another, the seller is not compelled to sell </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">another time. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the seller: <span class="gemarra-regular">You knew that I took, </span>i.e., purchased, the field <span class="gemarra-regular">for myself, and it was merely </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">protection [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufanaḥya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that I desired </span>to obtain ownership by claiming to purchase it in the name of the other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I do not throw </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">money for naught. Rather, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with the intention that you will write another document for him, </span>i.e., the seller, stating that I purchased the field. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the seller can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I have performed a matter for you together with the one in whose name you purchased</span> the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him write you another document.</span>
The Gemara discusses Abaye’s interpretation of the latter clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to him: </span>I will purchase the field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that you will provide a deed in my name, <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller is compelled to sell </span>the field again. Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the witnesses in front of </span>the seller: You can <span class="gemarra-regular">see that I require another document. Lest you say </span>that the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: I thought </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a document from the one in whose name you purchased </span>the field that <span class="gemarra-regular">you were saying </span>you required, and not from me. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the purchaser can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I took the trouble and said to the witnesses, in front of you, </span>that I require another document, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is from you that I require </span>the document.
§ The Gemara mentions a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana gave money </span>to a salesman in exchange <span class="gemarra-regular">for flax, </span>and temporarily left the flax in the possession of the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">flax appreciated </span>in value and the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the flax sold it </span>for a greater profit on behalf of Rav Kahana, intending to give him all of the money. Rav Kahana then <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What should I do? Should I go and take my money, </span>or would doing so have the appearance of collecting interest for a loan? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: <span class="gemarra-regular">If, when they sold </span>the flax, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said: This flax is Kahana’s, go take </span>the money, as in such a case it is as though the flax was purchased directly from you. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take </span>the money, since you would be receiving a greater sum of money than you provided, and this would appear to be a loan repaid with interest.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was Rav’s ruling? Was it only <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: Who informed the owner of the wheat that he should transfer the wheat to the owner of the money? </span>As the Gemara taught earlier, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that the sale can be performed on another’s behalf only if such an arrangement is explicitly stated at the time of the transaction. In this case as well, if the seller did not explicitly state that the money would belong to Rav Kahana, all the money from the sale would be acquired by the seller, who would then be prohibited to give it to Rav Kahana due to the appearance of paying interest. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that Rav Kahana gave four </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and took eight </span>in return? He did not lend money to the seller. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the flax appreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>and when the seller sold it <span class="gemarra-regular">he robbed </span>Rav Kahana of his flax, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we learned </span>in a mishna (93b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">all robbers pay </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value of the stolen item at <span class="gemarra-regular">the time of the robbery. </span>Therefore, according to all opinions the seller owes Rav Kahana the value of the flax at the time the seller sold it for its appreciated value, and Rav Kahana’s accepting the money would not constitute collecting interest for a loan.
Having rejected the previous explanation of Rav’s ruling, the Gemara presents an alternative understanding of the case. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: There, it was </span>a matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust, </span>as the seller was paid in advance <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Kahana did not pull the flax </span>as an act of acquisition, or perform any other formal act of acquisition. Consequently, at the time of the second sale the flax belonged to the seller. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rav says: One may make </span>an arrangement of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust with regard to </span>the delivery of items such as <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one may pay the money in advance with the agreement that he will receive the produce at a later date, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not make </span>an arrangement of <span class="gemarra-regular">trust with regard to money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one may not pay the money in advance with the agreement that he will receive the value of the produce at a later date, as this has the appearance of collecting interest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who robs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of an item having <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and takes </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath to </span>the robbery victim claiming his innocence, and then later wishes to repent, must <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the money, which includes the principal together with an additional one-fifth payment, to the robbery victim, even if this necessitates following <span class="gemarra-regular">after him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a distant place like <span class="gemarra-regular">Medea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">may not give </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robbery victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to return it to the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and neither </span>may he give it <span class="gemarra-regular">to his agent, but he may give </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to an agent of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, he returns it to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">the principa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> value of the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not give him </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth</span> payment, or if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">forgave him concerning the principal but did not forgive him concerning </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth</span> payment, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he forgave him concerning this and concerning that, with the exception of the value of less than one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the principal, he need not pursue him </span>to repay the remaining debt. By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>the robbery victim the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not give him the principal, </span>or if the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">forgave him concerning </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not forgive him concerning the principal, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he forgave him concerning this and concerning that, with the exception of the value of one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the principal, he must pursue him </span>to repay the remaining debt.
If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal and took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath to him concerning </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, asserting that he had already paid it, 

Daf 103b

then the additional one-fifth is considered a new principal obligation. The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> payment about which he had taken a false oath. If he then takes a false oath concerning the second one-fifth payment, he is assessed an additional one-fifth payment for that oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">until the principal, </span>i.e., the additional one-fifth payment about which he has most recently taken the false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">is reduced to less than the value of one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And such </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a deposit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: </span>“If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against the Lord, and he defrauds his counterpart <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a deposit, or with regard to a pledge, or with regard to a robbery, or if he exploited his counterpart; or he has found that which was lost, and deals falsely with it, and swears to a lie</span>…he shall restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more to it” (Leviticus 5:21–24). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a robber took a false oath that he did not rob, he must travel even as far as Medea in order to repay the robbery victim. This indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes an oath to </span>the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he is required to go to any length to repay his obligation, but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take an oath to him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he does not have to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon and not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> 118b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not know which of them </span>he robbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and each one </span>of the five <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He robbed me, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">places </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and withdraws </span>from them; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: This is not </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">way to spare him from transgression. </span>He is not considered to have returned the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pays </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item to each and every one </span>of the five.
The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna written? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, </span>it is not so, because <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>that he did not rob, Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He places </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item between them and withdraws; </span>it is not his responsibility to ensure that it reaches the robbery victim. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>it is also not so, because <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>He is not considered to have returned the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pays </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item to each and every one </span>of the five, while the mishna rules that his obligation is contingent upon his having taken the false oath.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, and when Rabbi Akiva says </span>that the robber is not considered to have returned the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pays </span>the value of the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item to each and every one </span>of the five, it is only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath that </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>this. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? As the verse states </span>with regard to one who takes a false oath concerning a financial obligation: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, on the day of his being guilty” </span>(Leviticus 5:24). The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the guilty party must make a rigorous effort to return what he owes is stated in the case of one who took a false oath, and Rabbi Akiva would state his ruling only in that case.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon </span>rule that a robber who took a false oath is not required to pay all claimants, being that the verse indicates otherwise? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though he took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>and by Torah law is obligated to return the stolen item to the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages instituted an ordinance </span>allowing him to place it between the five possible victims, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted a great ordinanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> stating <span class="gemarra-regular">that if the expense </span>required to return a stolen item to the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the principal, </span>the robber may <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to the court, and </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">brings his guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and achieves atonement for himself. </span>This ordinance would apply here as well, as the expense required to pay all five claimants is greater than the principal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>agree that the Sages instituted this ordinance? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Sages instituted the ordinance, </span>they did so only for cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">knows whom he robbed, as </span>in such cases <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>definitely <span class="gemarra-regular">returning the money to its owner </span>by depositing it with the court, who will convey it to the robbery victim. But in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed one of five </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not know whom he robbed, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>by merely placing the stolen item between the five of them <span class="gemarra-regular">the money is not returned to its owner, the Sages did not institute an ordinance.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection </span>to the explanation that Rabbi Akiva stated his opinion specifically in a case where the robber took an oath. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> 14:2) states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva did not disagree with regard to one who purchased </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not know from which of them he purchased </span>it, as both agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he places the money of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purchase between them and withdraws. </span>Since the purchaser has not transgressed, he is not penalized by being required to suffer the loss of paying each of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what did they disagree? </span>They disagree with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who robbed one of five people, and he does not know from which of them he robbed </span>the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Tarfon says: He places the stolen item between them and withdraws, and Rabbi Akiva says: He has no remedy, </span>i.e., he has not fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">until he pays </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the stolen item to each and every one </span>of them.
Rav Huna bar Yehuda states his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind that </span>Rabbi Akiva stated his ruling specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>an item from another, and <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">robbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> him? In either case he has transgressed the prohibition against taking a false oath denying his obligation, and he should be penalized by being required to ensure that the one to whom he owes the money receives it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava raises another objection </span>to the explanation that Rabbi Akiva stated his opinion specifically in a case where the robber took an oath. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain pious </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who purchased </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">two people, and he did not know from which of them he purchased </span>the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he came before Rabbi Tarfon </span>for a ruling. Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Place the money of your purchase between them and withdraw. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Akiva, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have no remedy until you pay each and every one, </span>i.e., both of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that Rabbi Akiva stated his ruling specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, does a pious </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">take a false oath? </span>It seems from this incident that Rabbi Akiva rules he must pay all potential owners regardless of whether or not he took a false oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">he took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath and later became a pious </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>isn’t there a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that we say: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain pious </span>man, the pious man is <span class="gemarra-regular">either Rabbi Yehuda ben Bav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava and Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, were </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">pious </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning.</span>
Due to these objections, the Gemara offers an alternative explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">is actually </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, and Rabbi Tarfon concedes </span>that a robber must pay every potential owner in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>as is the case in the mishna here. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? As the verse states: “Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty” </span>(Leviticus 5:24). This verse, which requires one to go to any length to return money owed, is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath concerning his financial obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva, who said </span>in the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> that a robber must pay all potential owners <span class="gemarra-regular">even though he did not take </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>agrees that the verse is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath, but holds that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">penalize </span>the robber by obligating him to pay them all in any event.
The Gemara questions this explanation of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, after all, </span>the mere fact that it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath is not sufficient </span>to obligate him to pay the additional one-fifth and to bring a guilt-offering if it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">admi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that he took a false oath and owes the money. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>would the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>state: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even without </span>taking the false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>the robber should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be obligated to pursue the owner as a result of his having admitted his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where a robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to two </span>people: <span class="gemarra-regular">I robbed one of you </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars and I do not know which of you </span>it was, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives one hundred dinars to this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dinars to that </span>person, 

Daf 104a

<span class="gemarra-regular">as he has already admitted </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Tarfon concedes that a robber who wishes to repent must go to any length to return the stolen item to its owner. If the mishna here is in accordance with his opinion, it should not have stated its ruling specifically in a case where the robber took a false oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated here could be in accordance with the opinions of both Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva. <span class="gemarra-regular">For as </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">knows whom he robbed and admitted to him </span>that he robbed him, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is possible to return the money to its owner, </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">is as the one who says to </span>the robber: The money you owe me <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span>kept <span class="gemarra-regular">in your possession </span>as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">for me. Therefore, </span>in a case where the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the owner is considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The money you owe me <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span>kept <span class="gemarra-regular">in your possession </span>as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, since </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">requires atonement </span>for his false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not possible </span>for him to achieve atonement <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">reaches the possession of </span>the robbery victim. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case where the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the money <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered as a <span class="gemarra-regular">deposit </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and takes it.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that if the robber wishes to return the stolen item, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not give </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robbery victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>to return it to the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor to his agent. </span>The Gemara comments: It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent who was appointed in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to collect a debt from another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>Such an agent <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, </span>so that the debtor is considered to have repaid his debt as soon as he transfers the money to the agent, and the debtor will not be held responsible if an accident occurs causing the loss of the money before the agent gives it to the creditor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>Such an agent <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, </span>and the debtor remains responsible until the money reaches the creditor’s possession.
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">is an agent </span>because it was <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>reason that the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">took the trouble and appointed </span>the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, in order to place </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">under </span>the agent’s <span class="gemarra-regular">domain. Rabba said </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not an agent </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>assumed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>to the debtor: This individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is a trustworthy person. If you </span>are willing to <span class="gemarra-regular">rely </span>on him, then <span class="gemarra-regular">rely </span>on him to convey the payment to me. Similarly: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish to send </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">send </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession.</span>
The Gemara cites a mishna that poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 98b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>enters into an agreement to <span class="gemarra-regular">borrow a co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> from another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">sent it </span>to the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">son, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, or </span>if he sent it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the borrower’s son, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">slave, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, and </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the borrower is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the cow, as it never entered his possession.
The Gemara explains the case of the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this agent of </span>the borrower, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances </span>surrounding his appointment? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not appoint </span>him as his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, how do we know </span>that he was appointed as an agent? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he appointed </span>him as his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the borrower is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. </span>This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who holds that one acquires property through his agent. According to his reasoning, the borrower should be held responsible for the cow once it reaches the possession of the agent.
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>concerning a different mishna: This is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his hired </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">or his </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">harvester</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here also </span>the mishna in <span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his hired </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">or his </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">harvester. </span>The mishna discusses a case where there were no witnesses to the appointment of the agent, and therefore it does not pose a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda. Yet, since it is well known that this person is constantly in the owner’s service, he is assumed to be acting as his agent.
The Gemara poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from the mishna here. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If the robber wishes to return the stolen item, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not give </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robbery victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>to return it to the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor to his agent. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this agent of </span>the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances </span>surrounding his appointment? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">did not appoint him </span>as his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, how do we know </span>that he was appointed as an agent? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed him </span>as his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, </span>and the robber nevertheless does not fulfill his obligation to return the stolen item by giving it to this agent? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda interpreted </span>the ruling of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his hired </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">or his </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">harvester, </span>who do not require witnesses to validate their appointment as his agent.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent who </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, </span>one appointed before witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent? </span>If that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">instead of teaching </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause: But he may give </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to an agent of the court, </span>which indicates that this is the only agent to whom he may give it, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">make a distinction within </span>the case of an agent appointed by the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">itself and teach: An agent who </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses is indeed </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent. </span>If an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses is a legally recognized agent, why does the mishna shift to discuss an agent of the court?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Although the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna could have stated the case of an agent appointed by the robbery victim in the presence of witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have stated this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">definitively, </span>as with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent of the court, </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>whether the <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery victim appointed him </span>as an agent, i.e., the court appointed him at the behest of the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>whether the <span class="gemarra-regular">robber appointed him </span>as an agent, i.e., the court appointed him at the behest of the robber. In both cases <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>could state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning an agent of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">definitively. </span>By contrast, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent who was appointed in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses, that </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery victim appointed him </span>as an agent <span class="gemarra-regular">he is an agent, </span>but when the <span class="gemarra-regular">robber appointed him </span>as an agent, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not an agent, </span>as the robber cannot appoint an agent to receive payment on behalf of the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have stated this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">definitively.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this mishna, which rules that an agent of the court is an agent even if appointed only by the robber, serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>following <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (10:11) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent of the court who was appointed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery victim but not appointed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">robber, or </span>an agent who <span class="gemarra-regular">was appointed by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">robber, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>i.e., the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">and took his </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the agent’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, </span>the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for any accidental damage to the payment during the delivery. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states that the robber is exempt from paying for any accidental damage when he gave the payment to a court agent he appointed only if the robbery victim sent for and took possession of the payment. This is in opposition to the ruling of the mishna that the robber is exempt whenever he gives the payment to an agent of the court.
The Gemara cites the opinion of two other <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> with regard to the status of an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: An agent who was appointed in </span>the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses is </span>a legally recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">agent. And if you say: Our mishna </span>contradicts this assertion, as it rules that the stolen item is not considered returned if given to an agent of the robbery victim, this is of no concern.
The Gemara explains: The mishna does not mean to disqualify an agent appointed by the robbery victim in the presence of witnesses, but rather is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">provides </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">with an agen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> without appointing him in the presence of witnesses, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he says to </span>someone: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have money </span>owed to me that is currently <span class="gemarra-regular">with so-and-so, and he is not sending it. Present yourself to him, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>he wishes to return it but <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot find a person with whom to send it. </span>
The Gemara offers a second explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>that the mishna is not discussing a case where he appointed the agent in the presence of witnesses, but it is still known that the agent acts on behalf of the robbery victim, as the ruling of the mishna is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the victim’s hired </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">or his </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">harvester. </span>That is why the robber is still liable after having given the payment to the agent.
§ The Gemara discusses another matter relating to the appointment of an agent. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>

Daf 104b

One who owes a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">may not send money </span>with another to the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis of a figure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyokani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> or sign used in place of a signature that is associated with the creditor. The possession of this sign on the part of the other is not sufficient proof that he has been appointed as an agent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if witnesses </span>verifying that this is the creditor’s sign <span class="gemarra-regular">are signed on it. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses signed on it, one may send </span>the money with the other.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: According to Shmuel, what is the rectification, </span>i.e., what recourse is available to one who wishes to collect a debt without traveling to the debtor’s location? The Gemara answers: One may act <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>course of action <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Abba, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">was owed mone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by Rav Yosef bar Ḥama. </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Safra: When you come </span>back from Rabbi Yosef bar Ḥama’s locale, <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>my money <span class="gemarra-regular">to me. When </span>Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">went there, Rava, </span>Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s <span class="gemarra-regular">son, said to him: Did </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">write you </span>a document stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have received </span>payment, so that my father will have proof that he has absolved himself of the debt? Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No. </span>Rava responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, first go </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him write you </span>a document stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have received </span>payment, and then my father will pay you.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Even if he writes you </span>a document stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have received </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is nothing, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps by </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">you arrive </span>back here, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba will have died and the money will fall before </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">orphans </span>as an inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the document stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have received </span>payment, that was written <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Abba, will be nothing, </span>as the debt is no longer owed to him, but rather, to his heirs. Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rather, what is the rectification? </span>Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go, </span>and Rabbi Abba will <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer to yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> the rights to the money owed to him <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">write for us </span>a document stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have received </span>payment. Then, we will pay you.
The Gemara notes: And this is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>course of action <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappa, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">was owed twelve thousand dinars </span>by a resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">Bei Ḥozai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred </span>his claim to the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Shmuel bar Abba by means of </span>the acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">threshold of his house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When </span>Rav Shmuel bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Bei Ḥozai with the money in hand, Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">went out as far as Tavak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> toward him </span>in his excitement to receive the money.
§ The mishna teaches that if the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal </span>value of the stolen item, but did not give him the additional one-fifth payment required of a robber, he is not required to pursue the robbery victim in order to return the additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitutio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> rather than a fine. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">died, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs </span>of the robber must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay it </span>to the robbery victim. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we also learned </span>in the mishna that if the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">the principal and takes </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, asserting that he had already paid it, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment about which he had taken a false oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is monetary restitution, </span>as one is obligated to pay an additional one-fifth for taking a false oath only with regard to monetary restitution, not with regard to fines.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs another and takes </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that he did not rob him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs pay the principal and </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payments to the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">but are exempt from </span>the obligation to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">the guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs obligated </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">of their father, </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is monetary restitution, and </span>therefore the <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs must pay </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. After having stated that one is required to add the additional one-fifth payment only for a robbery he commits himself, and not for a robbery committed by his father, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">still say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when does </span>an heir <span class="gemarra-regular">not pay </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for his father’s robbery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">when neither he nor his father took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath. </span>
But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>took a false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not his father; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">his father </span>took a false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not he; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he and his father </span>both took false oaths; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is the heir’s exemption derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“He shall restore the item <span class="gemarra-regular">that he robbed,” and </span>“the item <span class="gemarra-regular">that he has acquired through exploitation” </span>(Leviticus 5:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in this case the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">did not rob and did not exploit. </span>Since the verse states the obligation to pay the additional one-fifth payment when discussing one who robbed or exploited another, and the heir has done neither, he is exempt from payment. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that heirs are not obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the mishna and the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, they discuss a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>his obligation and therefore was required to pay the additional one-fifth payment, and this obligation is transferred to his heir; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the latter <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it discusses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not admit </span>his obligation and was never required to pay the additional one-fifth payment.
The Gemara rejects this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the latter <span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not admit </span>his obligation, then the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would be that the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">would not pay even the principal, </span>as the obligation is not known by anyone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>it is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not pay </span>the principal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>isn’t it understood <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">searches for </span>a source to teach the heir’s exemption from only the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that he does pay the principal.</span>
The Gemara also proves that the heir must pay the principal from the continuation of the same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And further, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">still say: When does </span>the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the principal for his father’s robbery? </span>It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">when he and his father </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>false <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths. </span>But if <span class="gemarra-regular">his father </span>took a false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not he; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>took a false oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not his father; </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">neither he nor his father </span>took false oaths; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is the heir’s obligation to pay the principal derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states </span>the following terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Robbery,” and “exploitation,” “lost item,” and “deposit” </span>(Leviticus 5:23); and <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a derivation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yesh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">talmud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>here to derive that the heir is obligated to pay the principal in all of these cases.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna sat and stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, his son, said to him: </span>Was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a derivation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yesh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">talmud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they will be paid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yishtalmu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am saying: There is a derivation, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from the additional </span>expressions in the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">I say </span>it can be derived. It is apparent that an heir is obligated to pay the principal, and this refutes Rav Naḥman’s attempted resolution.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>did Rav Naḥman mean when he suggested that the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not admit </span>his obligation and exempts his heir from paying the additional one-fifth but obligates him to pay the principal? The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">father did not admit, but his son did admit, </span>and therefore he is obligated to pay the principal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">his son be liable </span>to pay the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for his own </span>false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: In </span>the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">extant. </span>Although the false oath was taken, it is not the type of obligation for which one must pay an additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If in </span>the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">extant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be that the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that while heirs must return an item stolen by their father, they are not obligated to compensate the owner if the item is no longer extant. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is guaranteed </span>property, i.e., land, which the heirs inherited from the robber. Heirs are obligated to compensate the owner of a stolen item with inherited land, even if the stolen item itself is no longer extant.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when there i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> guaranteed property, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? </span>After all, such a debt <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>legally considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral</span> agreement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the creditor of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan by oral </span>agreement <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot collect from the heirs </span>of the debtor, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>can he collect <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who purchased </span>land from the debtor.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: 

Daf 105a

The reference here is to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the father had already <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>and was obligated to pay. In such a case, the debt is considered like a loan with a promissory note, which a creditor may collect from the debtor’s heirs. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the father had already <span class="gemarra-regular">stood trial </span>and was obligated to pay, then the heir, who took a false oath and later confessed, would have to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay even </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>as this would be akin to any monetary obligation; but the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rules that he is obligated to pay only the principal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>The heir is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">because one does not pay </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for the denial of </span>a debt that is secured by <span class="gemarra-regular">a lien on land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the stolen item is still extant, yet the heir is exempt because <span class="gemarra-regular">his father’s sack [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">disakaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> containing the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">was deposited in the possession of others. </span>Accordingly, the heir <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the principal, since </span>the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>extant, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not pay </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">because when he took an oath </span>that it was not in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">he took an oath truthfully, as he did not know </span>that his father had stolen the item.
§ The mishna teaches that if the robbery victim forgave the robber concerning both payments, <span class="gemarra-regular">excepting less than </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">value of one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the principal, </span>he need not pursue him in order to return the remaining debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: They taught </span>that the robber is not obligated to pursue the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is not extant, but </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">extant, he must pursue him </span>to return it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">will appreciate </span>in value, and the debt he owes will exceed the value of one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not different </span>when the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is extant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not different when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is not extant. </span>In either case <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not need to pursue him </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned that perhaps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it will appreciate </span>in value.
The Gemara cites another ruling with regard to a stolen item worth less than one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">three bundle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of goods that <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span> in total, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they depreciated </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>their value <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at two </span><span class="it-text">perutot</span>, even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he returned two </span>bundles <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robbery victim he <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated to return the other </span>bundle. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>(96b): If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it, </span>and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you, </span>and he is not required to pay compensation, despite the fact that the robbery victim has suffered a monetary loss.
The Gemara explains the proof from the mishna: It may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that he is not required to pay compensation is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">there in its unadulterated </span>form; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not there in its unadulterated </span>form, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though now it is not </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">money, since it was </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">money initially, </span>at the time of the robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to pay. Here too, even though </span>the third bundle is <span class="gemarra-regular">not worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> now, since initially it was worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he is required to pay.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">two bundles </span>of goods that <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perut</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> in total, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he returned one of them to </span>the robbery victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">now there is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">a stolen item </span>in the possession of the robber, as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>we say that since the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item that was in his possession </span>in its entirety, he is obligated to return the second bundle?
Rava himself <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolves </span>the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no stolen item here, </span>as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no returning </span>of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">here. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is no stolen item here, </span>as what remains is insignificant, it follows that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>fulfillment of the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">returning </span>the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>and the robber ought to be exempt, as he is no longer considered to be in possession of a stolen item. The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even though </span>the robber is exempt from returning the second bundle, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no stolen item here, there is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>fulfillment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva of returning </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the returned bundle was worth less than one <span class="it-text">peruta</span> as well.
§ Following Rava’s previous dilemma, the Gemara cites a similar dilemma raised by Rava. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite who shave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> his head as required <span class="gemarra-regular">but left two hair</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> uncut <span class="gemarra-regular">has done nothing, </span>and his obligation to shave his head has not been fulfilled. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If a nazirite shaved and left two hairs, and afterward he <span class="gemarra-regular">shaved one </span>of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one fell ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of its own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this considered shaving one’s entire head or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Is Rava raising a dilemma </span>as to whether one can <span class="gemarra-regular">shave </span>his head <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>hair? How does this case differ from that of one who shaves his entire head one hair at a time, which is a fulfillment of his obligation?
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>a resolution to Rava’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of </span>the hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">fell out </span>first, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he shaved </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one. Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any event, there is no measur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of hair left on his head that requires shaving, as one remaining hair is not significant, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">shaving, as initially he left </span>the significant amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">two hairs </span>uncut, <span class="gemarra-regular">and now when he shaves </span>a second time, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not two hairs </span>left for him to shave, and this does not qualify as shaving?
Rava himself <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolves </span>the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no hair here; there is no shaving here. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is no hair here, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">there is shaving here, </span>as no hair remains. The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even though there is no hair here, </span>as only one hair remains, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no mitzva of shaving here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he failed to shave it all on the first attempt, and the second time he shaved less than the required amount.
§ The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>(<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 10:6) that with regard to a sealed earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel that was puncture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed by sediment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from its contents, the sediments have effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">saved </span>the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity if the barrel were to come into contact with an impure item, as it is once again considered a sealed barrel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed half of </span>the hole, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Do we say that since the hole is not currently large enough to allow ritual impurity to penetrate, the barrel is considered sealed; or perhaps we say that since the hole was initially large enough to allow impurity to penetrate, and it has not yet been sealed completely, the barrel retains its status and is not considered sealed?
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: Isn’t this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated explicitly in <span class="gemarra-regular">our mishna, </span>quoted by Rava above? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned</span> in the continuation of that mishna: With regard to an earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel that was punctured and was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed by sediments, </span>the sediments have effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">saved </span>the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity. If it was not sealed by sediments and instead one <span class="gemarra-regular">plugged </span>the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">with a vine, </span>its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">until he smears </span>clay around the uncovered parts of the hole. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two </span>vines placed in the hole in order to plug it, its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">until he smears </span>clay <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sides </span>of the hole inward, <span class="gemarra-regular">and between one vine and the other.</span>
Rav Yeimar explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>its contents become impervious to contracting ritual impurity is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he smeared </span>clay over the uncovered sections of the hole, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not smear </span>clay over the uncovered sections, the contents would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be impervious to contracting ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should this not be like the case in Rava’s dilemma? <span class="gemarra-regular">But let it be </span>considered, when one plugs the hole with the vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>though <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed half of </span>the hole, since there is no apparent difference between a hole that is half-sealed and a hole that is partially plugged with a vine. Accordingly, Rava should not have stated his dilemma, as it is clear from the mishna that if the hole is only partially covered, the contents of the barrel are susceptible to contracting ritual impurity.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, if he does not smear </span>clay around the vines, the vine <span class="gemarra-regular">will not remain </span>in place. By contrast, in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he sealed half of it with a substance that remains </span>in place, as in Rava’s dilemma, the seal <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>in place and could be considered a seal. Rava’s dilemma remains unresolved. 
§ The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">may say to </span>the victim: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you. Rava raises a dilemma: </span>

Daf 105b

If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath concerning </span>the robbery of the leavened bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if it </span>were to be <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>from the robber, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">would need to pay </span>the initial value of the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the robbery victim, as he can no longer say: That which is yours is before you, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he has denied </span>a claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary matter to </span>the robbery victim and must consequently pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any event, it is resting </span>in the robber’s possession <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">mere dust, </span>since it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, and as such <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not denied </span>a claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary matter, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning a false oath do not apply.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The matter that was a dilemma for Rava is obvious to Rabba, as Rabba says </span>that in a scenario where one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">You stole my ox</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I did not steal </span>it. 
The first asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">nature of its </span>presence <span class="gemarra-regular">in your </span>possession? The second responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am an unpaid baile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the defendant then takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he exempted himself from </span>liability in cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft and loss.</span>
If he responds instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am a paid bailee over it, </span>and takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he exempted himself from </span>liability in cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">breakage and death.</span>
If he responds instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am a borrower of it, </span>and takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he exempted himself from </span>liability in cases where the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">died due to </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">labor.</span>
In all of these cases, the ox is in the possession of the one who took the false oath, and he admits that it belongs to the other. The Gemara analyzes Rabba’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabba holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the ox is now <span class="gemarra-regular">extant </span>and can be returned to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if it were to be stolen, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>be found to <span class="gemarra-regular">be denying </span>a claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary matter, </span>as according to his claim he would then be exempt from paying, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>considered to <span class="gemarra-regular">be denying </span>a claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary matter as well. Here, </span>in the case of the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">also, even though it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">mere dust, since, if it were to be stolen, he would be required to pay </span>the robbery victim <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged monetary restitution, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>considered to <span class="gemarra-regular">be denying </span>a claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary matter as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava sat and said this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that one who protected himself from potential liability for payment by taking a false oath that he is a bailee is liable to pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram raised an objection to Rava </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states concerning one who is liable for taking a false oath concerning a monetary matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And deals falsely with it” </span>(Leviticus 5:22); this serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude one who admits to the primary </span>feature of a claim. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">so? </span>In a scenario where one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">You stole my ox, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I did not steal </span>it. 
The first asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">nature of its </span>presence <span class="gemarra-regular">in your </span>possession? The second responds with any of the following replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">You sold it to me; you gave it to me as a gift; your father sold it to me; your father gave it to me as a gift; it chased after my cow </span>and entered my domain; <span class="gemarra-regular">it came to me on its own; I found it straying on the road </span>and I brought it home; <span class="gemarra-regular">I am an unpaid bailee over it; I am a paid bailee over it; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">I am a borrower of it; and </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>that he had done so; one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that he <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable. The verse states: “And deals falsely with it,” </span>which serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude one who admits to the primary </span>feature of a claim. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states explicitly that one who takes a false oath that he is a bailee is not liable; how can Rava state otherwise?
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Fool, when that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here you are</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and presented the ox to him immediately, so that he did not profit by claiming that he was a bailee. <span class="gemarra-regular">When I spoke, </span>I was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">was standing in </span>a different place, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">a swamp, </span>and was not returned to the owner.
Several examples of an oath in which the robber admits to the primary feature of a claim were cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above. The Gemara analyzes some of these examples. When the robber says: <span class="gemarra-regular">You sold </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <span class="gemarra-regular">what admission to the primary </span>feature of the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">is there? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: </span>You sold the animal to me, but <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not give you </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take your ox and go.</span>
When the robber says: <span class="gemarra-regular">You gave it to me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your father gave it to me, </span>he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <span class="gemarra-regular">what admission to the primary </span>feature of the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">is there? </span>The Gemara explains: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: </span>It was given to me <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that I will afford you satisfaction, and I did not do </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for you; take your ox and go.</span>
When the robber says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I found it straying on the road </span>and I brought it home, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have returned i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me. Shmuel’s father said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I found </span>the ox as <span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item, and I did not know that it was yours so that I could return it to you.</span>
§ After discussing a false oath taken by a robber in which he admits to the primary feature of a claim, the Gemara discusses a false oath taken by witnesses. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: When a witness takes an oath that he has no knowledge of the status of a lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are three </span>possible false <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths, </span>i.e., the oath may be false for one of three reasons: The witness may have <span class="gemarra-regular">recognized </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>recognize <span class="gemarra-regular">its finder, </span>or he may have recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">its finder but </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>recognize the item, or he may have recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">nor its finder. </span>In each of these cases, the witness took a false oath that he had no knowledge of the lost item, when in fact he had limited knowledge of it.
The Gemara asks: In the third case cited above, where the witnesses recognized <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">nor its finder, he took his oath in truth </span>when he claimed that he did not have knowledge of the lost item. Why is this cited as an example of a false oath? The Gemara emends the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the reference here is to a case where he recognized both the item <span class="gemarra-regular">and its finder.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For which </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> did ben Azzai cite these examples? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ami says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina </span>says: They were cited <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> teach that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">exemptio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in these cases from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that these examples were cited <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that the witness incurs <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>to bring an offering in these cases.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Ami and Shmuel disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue that is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who administers an oath </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a single witnes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and the witness takes a false oath that he has no awareness of the monetary matter at hand, the witness is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from bringing a sin-offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, deems </span>the witness <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring a sin-offering.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that causes financial</span> loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value. Similarly, the potential monetary benefit that the witness can generate by causing the defendant to admit to the debt and pay the owner is considered to have monetary value. Therefore, the witness is considered to have taken a false oath with regard to a monetary matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that an item that causes financial loss <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not considered </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value. Similarly, the potential monetary benefit that the witness can generate by causing the defendant to admit to the debt and pay the owner is not considered to have monetary value. Therefore, the witness is not considered to have taken a false oath with regard to a monetary matter.
§ The Gemara discusses the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning a bailee who denies having a deposit in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>A bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">denies </span>a claim <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning a deposi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> becomes </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber with regard to it, and </span>he is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay even <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> damage that is the result of <span class="gemarra-regular">accidents. </span>The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And deals falsely with it” </span>(Leviticus 5:22–24), and <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>from this verse the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment </span>for one who denies having a deposit. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>itself derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Neither shall you deal falsely” </span>(Leviticus 19:11). The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment of </span>having to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>due to his denial even for accidental damage, in accordance with the statement of Rav Sheshet?
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment </span>for taking a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment and the bringing of the offering. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took an oath, it may be inferred that the first clause </span>teaches a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not take an oath, </span>and the punishment referred to by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is the imposition of liability for accidental damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the latter clause teaches </span>that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And swear to a lie” </span>(Leviticus 5:22), and <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>from this that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a punishment </span>for taking a false oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>itself derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Nor lie” </span>(Leviticus 19:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">And from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>teaches the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took an oath, the first clause </span>must be teaching the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not take an oath.</span>
The Gemara answers: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>clause are referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took an oath, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the latter clause, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>his false oath, while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the first clause, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">where witnesses came </span>and testified that the deposit is in his possession. Where <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>damage that is a result of <span class="gemarra-regular">accidents, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">where he admitted </span>his false oath, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay for the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering. </span>Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring in both clauses to a case where the bailee took an oath, it offers no support for Rav Sheshet’s statement.
After dismissing the attempted proof for Rav Sheshet’s statement that a bailee who denies possession of a deposit is considered a robber even without having taken a false oath, the Gemara now attempts to disprove the statement itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection </span>to Rav Sheshet’s statement: Though it is usually the defendant who is required to take an oath in order to avoid having to pay a claim, there are cases in which the plaintiff takes an oath to receive payment. The mishna in <span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> (44b) lists these cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one such case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the plaintiff’s <span class="gemarra-regular">opponent, </span>i.e., the defendant, <span class="gemarra-regular">is suspect with regard to an oath, </span>i.e., there is reason for the court to believe that he would take a false oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>would the defendant have become suspect? It would be by having taken a false oath with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">either an oath of testimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or an oath on a deposit, or even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>taken in <span class="gemarra-regular">vain.</span>
The Gemara comments: Since the mishna states that he becomes suspect only as a result of having taken a false oath, it can be inferred that he does not become suspect by virtue of denial of a claim alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that a bailee who denies having taken the deposit is considered a robber even without having taken an oath, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">denial that he </span>ought to be <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified, </span>as a robber does not have the credibility to take an oath.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in defense of Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here, </span>in the case of the mishna in <span class="it-text">Shevuot</span>? We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in </span>a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">a swamp, as </span>in this case his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">denial, because he thinks </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will evade </span>the owner by claiming that I never took the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">until I go and bring it to him. </span>Therefore, he is not considered to be a robber. By contrast, Rav Sheshet is referring to a case where the bailee denied responsibility for the item while it was in his possession, as he intended to keep it for himself.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that one who denies possession of an item only so that he may later return it is not considered a robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Idi bar Avin says: One who denies </span>a claim <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>having taken <span class="gemarra-regular">a loa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is fit to bear witness, </span>

Daf 106a

but one who denies a claim <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>having taken <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is disqualified from bearing witness,</span> because if it is clear that the deposit is in his possession, yet he denies it, he must be lying.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty with regard to Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Ilfa say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath effects acquisition, </span>meaning that once he testified falsely that he did not become a bailee, the item in question becomes his property, rendering him liable as a robber even for damage or loss resulting from accidents? The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the taking of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that effects acquisition, but </span>mere <span class="gemarra-regular">denial </span>of having become a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">does not effect acquisition. </span>The Gemara rejects this distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>Ilfa must be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in </span>a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">a swamp,</span> and as long as he does not take an oath, it can be assumed that his intention is simply to be evasive. But if the animal was standing in his house, then he acquires it as soon as he denies the claim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of Ilfa’s statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath effects acquisition? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said </span>that if one party says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hundred dinars in your possession, and the other </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: You do not </span>have any money <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and later, witnesses cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and testified that his oath was false, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: </span>“The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” </span>(Exodus 22:10); teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">once the owner received an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one who took the oath <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer pays monetary restitution.</span> Ilfa’s statement that an oath effects acquisition means that the bailee will no longer have to pay monetary restitution, and it does not relate to Rav Sheshet’s statement that the bailee becomes responsible for damage resulting from accidents as soon as he denies the claim.
§ Having mentioned Rav’s ruling, the Gemara addresses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: Rav Huna says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says </span>that if one party says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">says: You do not </span>have any money <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and later, witnesses came </span>and testified that his oath was false, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, as it is stated: “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution” </span>(Exodus 22:10); teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">once the owner received an oath, </span>the one who took the oath <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer pays monetary restitution.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Rav’s statement is reasonable in </span>the case of one who denies having taken <span class="gemarra-regular">a loan, which is intended for expenditure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the money is no longer in his possession, the Torah exempts him from monetary restitution once he takes an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of one who denies having accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposit, it remains in the owner’s possession </span>and must be returned intact, and it is not considered to be monetary restitution. Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But, by God, Rav said </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of one who denies having accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposit, as when </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>exempting him from payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is written, it is written in </span>the case of one who denies having accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposit.</span>
§ The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman was sitting and saying this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi raised an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from that which was taught in a mishna (108b): If the owner asked the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my deposit, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">lost, </span>and the owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>thereby accepting the oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he consumed </span>the deposit, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the principal. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted of his own </span>accord that he had taken a false oath, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering. </span>This indicates that one is required to pay monetary restitution for a deposit even after taking an oath.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to him: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one takes an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oath outside of court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not exempt him from paying restitution. Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If the owner asked the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my deposit, </span>and the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen, </span>and the owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>thereby accepting the oath; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole it, </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment of double </span>the principal. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted of his own </span>accord that he had taken a false oath, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering. And if it enters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mind </span>that this oath was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of court, is there </span>an obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>in such a circumstance?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am able to answer you </span>by saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna is referring to one who took an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of court, and the latter clause </span>of the mishna is referring to one who took an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">in court, but we will not answer you with a forced answer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Instead, I will explain it this manner: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>clause are referring to an oath taken <span class="gemarra-regular">in court, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the ruling of the first clause is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">leape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to take an oath as soon as the other litigant stated his claim, even though the court had not yet required him to do so, which is not considered a full-fledged oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the ruling of the latter clause is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not leap </span>but took an oath only when required by the court.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Naḥman: After all, you do not hold </span>in accordance with the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav; why are you pledging yourself to </span>explain the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span>so that it not be contradicted by the mishna? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I said this not to justify Rav’s ruling but <span class="gemarra-regular">to clarify </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, as Rav </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">explain the mishna in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>manner, as I did. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rav quoted a verse,</span> so how could Rav Naḥman not agree with his statement? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> in response: This <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>was not written to teach the ruling of Rav; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it comes to </span>teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">all those </span>discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah </span>who are required to <span class="gemarra-regular">take oaths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take oaths and do not pay; </span>as the verse should be interpreted as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</span> (Exodus 22:10), teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to pa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath, </span>and not the one demanding payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna raises an objection </span>to Rav’s statement from a different mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 36b), which states: If an owner requested the return of his deposit and the purported bailee denied having received it, and the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">administered an oath </span>to the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">five times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether before the court or not before the court, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">denied </span>the claim each time, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for each and every one </span>of the oaths and must pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering for each one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon says: What is the reason? Since he is able to retract and admit </span>after each oath, at which point he would be liable to pay, therefore each subsequent false oath is a denial of that liability. It can be seen from this mishna that one who admits liability after having taken a false oath is liable to pay, counter to the statement of Rav.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And here, you cannot say </span>that the mishna in <span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> is referring to a case where the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">leaped </span>to volunteer his oath, because it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>explicitly that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">administered an oath </span>to the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the deposit. And <span class="gemarra-regular">you cannot say </span>that the mishna in <span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> is referring to a case where the bailee took his oath <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of court, </span>because it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>explicitly that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies whether the oath was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">before the court </span>or not before the court.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He, </span>Rav Hamnuna, <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection and he resolved it: </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches it disjunctively, </span>i.e., the rulings of the mishna are stated with regard to different circumstances. Where it teaches that the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">administered an oath </span>to the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the deposit, that is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of court,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>when it discusses an oath taken <span class="gemarra-regular">before the court, </span>it is referring to a case where the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">leaped </span>and volunteered his oath. Therefore, the mishna does not discuss the case with regard to which Rav issued his ruling, where the bailee was forced to take an oath before the court.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises an objection </span>to Rav’s statement from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner </span>acting as a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">claimed, with regard to a deposit, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he took an oath </span>to that effect <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>that he was lying and that in fact he took the item himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses came </span>and testified that the bailee himself indeed took the item, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if he admitted </span>his guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal </span>value of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he must also bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering. But if he admitted </span>his guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment and </span>brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rules that one who takes an oath is not exempt from payment, counter to the statement of Rav.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And here, </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">you cannot say that </span>it is referring to an oath taken <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of court or </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">leaped </span>and volunteered his oath, because <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and one is obligated to pay double payment only when the accused has an oath administered to him before the court.
The Gemara cites a new version of Rava’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">admits </span>to having taken a false oath, there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>whether one falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> claim </span>that the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost, and </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>whether one falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">as well; </span>in these cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav did not say </span>that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written </span>in the Torah portion discussing a false oath taken with regard to a deposit: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they shall confess </span>the sin that they performed, and he shall return the principal for his guilt, and he shall add to it one-fifth, and he gives it to the one with regard to whom is guilty” (Numbers 5:7), teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>anyone who admits to a false oath concerning a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to pay the principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment.
The Gemara continues the new version of Rava’s statement: Additionally, in a case where one falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief</span> stole the deposit and takes an oath to that effect <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses come </span>and say that he had stolen it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav did not say </span>that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, <span class="gemarra-regular">because double payment is written </span>in the Torah (see Exodus 22:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">When he says </span>that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim that </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not admit it, and witnesses come </span>and testify that he had stolen it.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Gamda went and said that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Ashi. </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Now </span>consider: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even Rav Hamnuna, </span>who was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav’s student and knew that Rav says </span>that one who takes a false oath is exempt from paying restitution even in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rav Hamnuna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">challenged </span>him from a mishna that teaches that one is not exempt in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav did not say </span>his <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>that he took a false oath? Presumably, Rav Hamnuna, as Rav’s student, was aware of the scope of his teacher’s ruling. How, then, can you limit it as being narrower than Rav Hamnuna’s interpretation? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi: Rav Hamnuna </span>did not raise a difficulty against Rav with regard to the case of one admitting to having taken a false oath, rather, with regard to the case where witnesses came after he took the oath, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult for him: </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that when <span class="gemarra-regular">one takes </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">then witnesses come, he is liable </span>to pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is why we hold him liable </span>for a guilt-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering for the final oath, since he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">retract and admi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his liability and incur an obligation to pay. Consequently, the fact that he took another false oath constitutes an additional false denial of his monetary liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say, </span>as Rav did, that even <span class="gemarra-regular">when witnesses come he is exempt </span>from paying, then the mishna’s ruling is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">is there any </span>similar case <span class="gemarra-regular">where if witnesses come and testify with regard to it, he would be exempt, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we would stand and obligate him </span>to bring a guilt-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering for a </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>for no reason other than <span class="gemarra-regular">since he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">retract and admit </span>his liability? As of <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any event, he has not admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to any liability and has no extant debt, and any further oaths that he takes are not denials of monetary liability. It follows, then, that Rava’s explanation of Rav’s opinion cannot be undermined by Rav Hamnuna’s challenge.
§ The Gemara cites another ruling concerning the topic of a bailee who claims that a deposit in his possession was stolen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim, with regard to a deposit, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> stole it, and it becomes clear that he stole it himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. If he slaughtered or sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
He explains his ruling by means of a comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since a thief pays double payment, and </span>one who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit also <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment, </span>it follows that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a thief, who </span>ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment, </span>and if he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>an animal he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">pays fourfold or fivefold payment, so too, </span>one who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole <span class="gemarra-regular">a deposit, who </span>ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment, </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the animal he received as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">pays fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief? </span>It is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>having taken a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath; will you say </span>that this stringency should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">who pays double payment only upon </span>taking a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath? </span>Therefore, one cannot derive from the obligation of a thief to pay fourfold or fivefold payment to the case of one who falsely states the claim that the deposit was stolen.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not base his ruling on a logical inference; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a derivation based upon <span class="gemarra-regular">a juxtaposition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the verses discussing a thief and one who falsely states the claim that a deposit was stolen are juxtaposed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one cannot refute </span>through analysis a derivation based upon <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposition.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a thief and one </span>verse is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>one who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit. According to him, there is a juxtaposition, and one can <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>derive one from the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the thief shall be found, </span>he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">and: “If the thief shall not be found” </span>(Exodus 22:7), are referring to one who falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit, and neither verse is referring to a thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is derived from an amplification indicated by the verse not employing the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“thief </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gannav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>and instead employing the expanded term <span class="gemarra-regular">“the thief [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hagannav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].” </span>This teaches that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the fourfold and fivefold payment applies to one who falsely states the claim that the deposit was stolen, as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba raised an objection to </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a scenario where one said to an unpaid bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my ox? </span>Then the bailee responded: It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen. </span>And the owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen. And the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he ate it, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. But here, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is impossible to </span>eat even <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering </span>the animal first, indicating that it must have been slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays double payment. </span>It can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment, yes, </span>he pays; but <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment, no, </span>he does not pay.
Rabbi Yoḥanan answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he ate it </span>as an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass. </span>Since it was not killed according to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual slaughter, the thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let</span> Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">answer </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as where he ate it </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal with a wound that will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cause it to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>in accordance with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the legal status of an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter for which the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that the legal status of an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter that is not fit </span>for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, </span>and the thief would pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">answer </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an animal removed from its mother’s womb after the mother was ritually slaughtered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ben</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">pekua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is permitted for consumption without slaughter, so that there is a possibility that the thief ate it without first slaughtering it. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ben</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">pekua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires slaughter.</span>
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">answer </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">stood in judgment </span>in court, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>the stolen animal, and he did not do so, and subsequently slaughtered or sold it? In this case he would not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as doesn’t Rava say </span>that if the judges instruct a thief: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">give him </span>the stolen animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt</span> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled on his matter, </span>requiring him to give the animal to the owner, and he did not heed the court’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">but slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, </span>and not a thief; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a robber does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment.</span>
Rava continues: But if the judges say only: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are obligated to give </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>and he did not heed the court’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">but slaughtered or sold </span>the animal, then he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">has not issued a definitive ruling in </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, he is still </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>rather than a robber.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, let </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">answer </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a partner who slaughtered </span>an animal stolen by him and his partner <span class="gemarra-regular">without the other </span>partner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that in such a case, the thief, i.e., the partner who slaughtered the animal, does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">selected one of two or three </span>possible answers but did not mean to say that it was the only possible answer.
§ The Gemara cites a related ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span> falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim, with regard to a lost item, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> stole it, i.e., he found a lost item, and when the owner requested its return, he claimed that it had been stolen from him, and it became known that he lied and had taken the item himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pays double payment. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>in the verse concerning double payment for a thief: “For any matter of trespass, from an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or <span class="gemarra-regular">for any lost item about which one shall say: </span>This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges; the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). It can be seen from here that double payment applies to a false claim of theft even with regard to a lost item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If a man gives </span>his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard, and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The use of the word “man” indicates that the <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>of a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">by a minor is nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gives </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is a minor and lodges the claim </span>concerning it <span class="gemarra-regular">against </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is </span>still a <span class="gemarra-regular">minor. From where </span>is it derived that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would be the same in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is a minor and lodges the claim </span>concerning it <span class="gemarra-regular">against </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges” </span>(Exodus 22:8), i.e., the claim is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>of the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">claim are equal, </span>both done when he is an adult.
Based on the ruling of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that even one who finds a lost item pays double payment for claiming falsely that it was stolen, indicating that the giving of the item as a deposit by the owner is not an essential condition to render the thief liable for double payment, then the claim of a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">should be like a lost item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well, </span>and one who received a deposit from a minor should be liable for double payment. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor, </span>so that at the time it was consumed, the owner had no legal standing. Therefore, the bailee is not obligated to pay.
Rabbi Abba bar Memel questions this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>had the bailee consumed it <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the owner was already <span class="gemarra-regular">an adult, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, </span>would the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">pays? If so, rather than teaching: </span>The claim is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>of the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">claim are equal, let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>The claim is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consumption </span>of the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">claim are equal, </span>which would be a more precise ruling. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>The claim is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consumption </span>of the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">claim are equal.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>a different answer to Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s objection: The two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are not comparable, </span>so an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement concerning a lost item cannot be derived from the case of a minor giving a deposit, because the <span class="gemarra-regular">lost item came </span>into the possession of the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">power of one </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent, </span>as the one who lost it is presumed to be an adult, though he did not personally give it to the finder; <span class="gemarra-regular">but this </span>deposit given by a minor <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come </span>into his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">power of one </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">mentally competent, </span>as from a halakhic perspective, a minor is not considered mentally competent. Therefore, he has no grounds for a claim.
§ The Gemara quotes a related ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim, with regard to a deposit, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not obligated </span>to take an oath, nor to pay double payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">until he denies part of </span>the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and admits to part of </span>the claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As the verse states: </span>“About which one shall say: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is it” </span>(Exodus 22:8), indicating an admittance of only this part, but no more. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says: </span>

Daf 107a

<span class="gemarra-regular">A merging of </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portions is written here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> written in this passage is in fact meant to be applied to a different passage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when it is written: “This is it,” </span>from which the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a partial admission is derived, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written concerning a loan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not a deposit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">a loa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply only there?
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba, as Rabba says: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did the Torah say </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">admits to a part of the claim must take an oath? </span>It is because there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not exhibit insolenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> by lying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of his creditor, </span>who had done him a favor by lending money to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>person who denies part of the claim actually <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to deny all of </span>the debt, so as to be exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not deny </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person does not exhibit insolence.</span>
Rabba continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in order not to exhibit insolence, he <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to admit to </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all of </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he denies </span>owing <span class="gemarra-regular">him in part </span>is because he <span class="gemarra-regular">reasons: If I admit to him with regard to all of </span>the debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will lodge a claim against me with regard to all of it, </span>and right now I do not have the money to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">I will evade him at least </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">now until I have money, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will pay </span>him all of it. This rationalization enables one to falsely deny part of a claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, the Merciful One imposes an oath on him, in order </span>to ensure <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will admit to him with regard to all of </span>the debt.
The Gemara completes its answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is with regard to a loan that this can be said, </span>as the basis for this explanation is that one will not exhibit insolence before his creditor, who did him a favor by lending him money; <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to a deposit, one will certainly exhibit insolence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the claimant did him no favor. Therefore, there is no reason to say that one who completely denies a claim concerning a deposit is deemed credible any more than one who admitted to part of it, and he is obligated to take an oath in either case. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama teaches </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: All <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">bailees</span>

Daf 107b

<span class="gemarra-regular">require denial of a par</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and admittance of a part of </span>the claim in order to be obligated to take an oath when someone claims to have given them an item as a deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these are they: An unpaid bailee, and a borrower</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a paid bailee, and a renter. </span>
The Gemara quotes the source for this statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: What is the reasoning </span>for the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rami bar Ḥama? </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee, it is explicitly written with regard to him: “This is it,” </span>as explained earlier. Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a paid bailee, </span>Rami bar Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">learns </span>by means of a verbal analogy to the term <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>used with regard to a paid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>used with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee, </span>since the verses about both a paid and an unpaid bailee begin: “If a man gives his neighbor” (Exodus 22:6, 9).
Rava continues: Rami bar Ḥama learns the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a borrower </span>from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vekhi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a man borrow” </span>(Exodus 22:13). There is a principle that the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">vav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, adds to the previous topic. </span>Based on this principle, the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a borrower are connected to those of the subject of the previous verse, the bailee. Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a renter, if </span>Rami bar Ḥama is stating his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that a renter is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a paid bailee, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">a paid bailee; if </span>he is stating his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that a renter is <span class="gemarra-regular">like an unpaid bailee, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says: </span>With regard to an unpaid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim, with regard to a deposit, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not liable </span>to pay double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he misappropriates it, </span>i.e., uses it for his own needs, before taking his oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The verse states: “If the thief shall not be found, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the house shall approach the judges to determine if he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods” </span>(Exodus 22:7), and the following verse concludes: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor.” <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>one can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he misappropriated it, he is liable </span>for double payment; <span class="gemarra-regular">that is to say that we are dealing </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he misappropriates it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to </span>his students: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen is liable for double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an animal still <span class="gemarra-regular">standing over its </span>feeding <span class="gemarra-regular">trough, </span>i.e., the bailee is still safeguarding it for its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Is he stating </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically with regard to </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">standing over its </span>feeding <span class="gemarra-regular">trough, but if the </span>bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">misappropriated it </span>before taking an oath, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an oath is not effective for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at all, </span>not even to cause him to be liable to pay double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he is stating </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">standing over its </span>feeding <span class="gemarra-regular">trough, </span>in addition to an animal that the bailee misappropriated?
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I did not hear this </span>ruling, so I cannot transmit Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, but <span class="gemarra-regular">I did hear </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to it, as Rabbi Asi says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to an unpaid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and retracted and </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses came </span>and testified that he lied, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from double payment for the second claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason; is it not due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he already <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the second oath is disregarded, which is why he is not liable for double payment for a false claim of theft? So too, one who misappropriates the deposit thereby acquires it and is no longer obligated to take an oath.
Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>there is no proof from there, because one could argue that the reason is not because he acquired the item with the first oath; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it left the owner’s possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the bailee taking the <span class="gemarra-regular">first oath, </span>he is exempt from taking an additional oath with regard to the same claim, but his oath will be significant even after having misappropriated the item.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was also stated: Rabbi Avin says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ile’a says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the claim, with regard to a deposit, that </span>it is now <span class="gemarra-regular">lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and retracts and </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim that </span>the deposit was taken through <span class="gemarra-regular">theft and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses come </span>and testify that he lied with regard to the claim of theft, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from double payment for the second claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it left the owner’s possession with </span>the bailee taking the <span class="gemarra-regular">first oath.</span>
The Gemara cites an <span class="it-text">amora</span> who disputes the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: </span>With regard to an unpaid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim, with regard to a deposit, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he misappropriated i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> before he took an oath he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is saying, </span>i.e., this is how the verse is to be understood: “If the thief shall not be found, <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the house shall approach the judges if he has not misappropriated</span> his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7), indicating that this verse speaks specifically with regard to a case where he did not misappropriate the deposit; <span class="gemarra-regular">consequently, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he misappropriated it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from double payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span>Rav Sheshet: <span class="gemarra-regular">But aren’t three oaths administere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by the court <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>any unpaid bailee who claims that the deposit was stolen from him? The first is: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I was not negligent in </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby enabling it to be stolen; the second is: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I did not misappropriate it; </span>the third is: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that it is not in my possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What, is it not </span>so that: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I did not misappropriate it, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to: An </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oath that it is not in my possession, </span>in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that it is not in my possession, when the matter becomes revealed that it is in his possession, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, so too, </span>with regard to: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I did not misappropriate it, when the matter becomes revealed that he did misappropriate it, </span>he should be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable?</span>
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>there is no proof from there, because one could say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I did not misappropriate it, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of: An oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I was not negligent in </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I was not negligent in </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">it, when the matter becomes revealed that he was negligent in </span>safeguarding <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from double payment, so too, </span>with regard to: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I did not misappropriate it, when the matter becomes revealed that he did misappropriate it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from double payment. </span>Since the comparison can be made between different pairings of the oaths to suggest opposite conclusions, none of these comparisons are definitive.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> quoted earlier (65b) teaches that a bailee who would be liable for double payment if witnesses were to testify that he had in fact stolen a deposit about which he had taken an oath attesting to its theft does not pay the additional one-fifth payment normally imposed upon one who takes a false oath with regard to a monetary claim. The Gemara explores the reason for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma: </span>Is it the <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>is it the taking of the <span class="gemarra-regular">oath that renders him liable for double payment </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment? 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which there is a practical difference between these possibilities? It is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thief </span>stole the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and retracts and </span>falsely <span class="gemarra-regular">states the claim </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost and takes an oath </span>to that effect, 

Daf 108a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and witnesses come </span>and testify <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>claim that at the time he took an oath that the deposit had been stolen, it was actually in his possession; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admits with regard to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>claim that it had been a lie and that it had not actually been lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: Is he obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment?
The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Is it being obligated in <span class="gemarra-regular">a monetary </span>obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">double paymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment for </span>the deposit due to the witness testimony and would therefore be exempt from the additional one-fifth payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>is it admitting to a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that renders him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this latter oath </span>that the item was lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it does not render him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment, </span>as he took an oath that it had been lost, not stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">will it render him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this dilemma from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 49b): In a scenario where one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to someone from the marketplace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Where is my ox that you stole? And </span>the accused <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not steal</span> it; whereupon the owner of the ox said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> administer an oath to you, and </span>the accused <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>accepting the oath; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify about </span>the accused <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole it, </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay double payment. And if he admitted of his own </span>accord that he stole it, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering.</span>
Rava explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses who render him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment, </span>as since the accused was not a bailee, the oath does not render him liable, and yet the mishna teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he admitted of his own </span>accord that he stole it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he must pay the additional one-fifth payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he admitted after witnesses </span>testified, then <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he is not required to pay the additional one-fifth.
Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that renders him liable </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pay the additional one-fifth payment if <span class="gemarra-regular">he admitted </span>that it was a false oath <span class="gemarra-regular">after witnesses </span>testified? <span class="gemarra-regular">After all, this oath does not render him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the double payment, </span>as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who falsely takes an oath that the item was stolen pays double payment applies only in the case of a bailee; therefore, the oath <span class="gemarra-regular">should render him liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, as does any false oath taken with regard to a monetary claim.
Rava completes the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from </span>this mishna that it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders him liable </span>to pay the <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts him from the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment? The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that the additional one-fifth payment is dependent upon the type of monetary obligation, and not an oath, resolving Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma.
§ Concerning the additional one-fifth payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raises a dilemma: </span>If the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">and the double payment </span>are split <span class="gemarra-regular">among two men, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">transferred his ox to two peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to safeguard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they stated the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>from them; <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>that it had been stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>of his own accord that he had lied, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>that it had been stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified that he had lied. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case?
Ravina clarifies the possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is particular with regard to one man that he does not pay </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">and the double payment, </span>whereas in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one </span>about whom the witnesses testified <span class="gemarra-regular">will pay the double payment and that one </span>who admitted of his own accord <span class="gemarra-regular">will pay the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps the Merciful One is particular that the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">and the double payment will not be paid for one monetary </span>obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here too, it is one monetary </span>obligation? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ Concerning the additional one-fifth payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payments <span class="gemarra-regular">or two double payments with regard to one man, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>; must he pay twice for the same monetary obligation? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the claim </span>that the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost and took an oath and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that it was not lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">and returned and </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the claim </span>that the same deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost, and took </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>supporting this claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>that it was not lost. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and took an oath and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and testified that he had taken it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he returned and </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the claim </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>stole the same deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses came </span>and again testified that he had taken it; <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
Rav Pappa clarifies the possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">two types of monetary restitution, </span>e.g., double payment and the additional one-fifth payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">that they will not be paid for one monetary </span>obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one type, </span>merely doubled; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps the Merciful One states </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution that they will not be paid for one monetary </span>obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here too, they are two </span>payments of <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whether in the case of two additional one-fifth payments or two double payments?
The Gemara suggests resolution to Rav Pappa’s dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as Rava says: </span>The verse states: “Or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shall add the fifth part [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamishitav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] more thereto” </span>(Leviticus 5:24). By employing a plural term, <span class="it-text">ḥamishitav</span>, and not the singular <span class="it-text">ḥamishito</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah added many </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifths for one principal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that one can become obligated in multiple one-fifth payments for the same principal. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>Rava’s statement that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
§ The Gemara discusses an amoraic dispute concerning a similar case: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">owner demanded of </span>an unpaid <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee </span>that he return a deposit, and he claimed that it had been stolen from him <span class="gemarra-regular">and took an oath </span>to that effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>despite being exempt from payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">he paid</span> of his own volition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief was identified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to whom </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>paid, the owner or the bailee? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says: To the owner of the deposit. Rava says: To the one in whose </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">the deposit </span>was when it was stolen, i.e., the bailee.
The Gemara explains their opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye says </span>that the double payment is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the deposit; since </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">troubled him by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>instead of paying immediately, the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>willing to <span class="gemarra-regular">grant acquisition of the double payment to </span>the bailee, so it is paid to the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that the double payment is paid <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one in whose </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">the deposit </span>was when it was stolen; <span class="gemarra-regular">once he paid, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">grants acquisition of the double payment to </span>the bailee.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they disagree with regard to the </span>deductive <span class="gemarra-regular">inference </span>to be drawn from the wording <span class="gemarra-regular">of the mishna, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Metzia</span> 33b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits with another, </span>i.e., an unpaid bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal or vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they were stolen or lost, </span>and the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not wish to take an oath,</span> which he may decide to do, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee takes an oath </span>that he is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">and is released </span>from the obligation to pay the owner, but may also opt to pay; in such a case the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief was found he pays double payment, </span>or if the deposited item was a sheep or an ox and the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment. To whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>those payments? He pays them <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one in whose </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">the deposit </span>was when it was stolen or lost. When the bailee paid the owner for the stolen item, he acquired it and therefore is entitled to any payment of principal or fine paid by the thief.
The mishna continues: If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath and did not wish to pay, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief was </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>and was required to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay double payment, </span>or he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered or sold </span>the sheep or ox and was required to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourfold or fivefold payment, to whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the money? He pays it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the deposit, </span>not to the bailee.
The Gemara explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye inferred </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava inferred </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause. Abaye inferred </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, as it teaches: </span>If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not wish to take an oath, </span>the thief pays the double, fourfold, or fivefold payment to the bailee. Abaye infers from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>the thief pays the bailee is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not wish to take an oath, </span>

Daf 108b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath, even though he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">paid, to whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">To the owner of the deposit.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava inferred </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause. </span>It teaches: If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath and did not want to pay, </span>the thief must pay the penalty to the owner of the deposit. Rava infers from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the thief pays the owner is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not want to pay, but </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">did pay, even though </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">to whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">To the one in whose </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">the deposit </span>was when it was lost.
The Gemara notes: The inference from <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause is difficult for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye. </span>The Gemara explains. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you: This is what </span>the latter clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath and did not want to pay </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">the oath, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>wanted to pay only <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>having taken <span class="gemarra-regular">the oath, </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">To the owner of the deposit. </span>Similarly, the Gemara notes: The inference from <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause is difficult for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava. </span>The Gemara explains. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: This is what </span>the first clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">paid, </span>meaning he had taken an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not want to stand by his oath, but </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">paid </span>in order to nullify the oath he had taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">to whom does </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>double payment? <span class="gemarra-regular">To the one in whose </span>possession <span class="gemarra-regular">the deposit </span>was when it was lost.
§ The Gemara relates another dilemma concerning the status of a bailee and stolen deposits. If the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>of a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">demanded from a bailee </span>that he return their deposit, and he claimed that it had been stolen from him <span class="gemarra-regular">and took an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to that effect; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief was recognized, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the bailee demanded of </span>the thief to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admitted </span>to having stolen it; and then the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner demanded of </span>the thief to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">and he denied </span>the claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">brought witnesses </span>that he had stolen it, <span class="gemarra-regular">did the thief become exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee, </span>as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when one admits liability to a penalty? Does the bailee have standing vis-à-vis the thief despite having exempted himself by taking an oath to the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">or did the thief not become exempt through </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath truthfully</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if it now becomes clear through the testimony of witnesses that the bailee’s oath was true, he is assumed to be someone the owner would rely on to collect the stolen item for him, and he remains a bailee. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief became exempt through </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee. If </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">taken falsely, </span>e.g., he took an oath that the animal given as a deposit died naturally and it is now clear that his oath was false, he is assumed to be someone whom the owner would not rely on to collect the stolen item for them, and he is no longer a bailee. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief did not become exempt through </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma</span> concerning the previous ruling: If a bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">rose to take a false oath but </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not let him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Should he be considered as one who had taken a false oath, as that was his intention, and he is no longer a bailee; or, since he never actually took the false oath, he is still a bailee? The Gemara comments: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>Rava’s question <span class="gemarra-regular">like this, </span>as quoted above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyumei </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>Rava’s question differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If he actually <span class="gemarra-regular">took a false oath, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is he still a bailee or not? The Gemara comments: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stand </span>unresolved.
The Gemara relates another dilemma concerning the status of a bailee and stolen deposits: If the <span class="gemarra-regular">owners </span>of a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">demanded from a bailee </span>that he return their deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> them instead of taking an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief was recognized, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the owners demanded of </span>the thief to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">and he admitted </span>to having stolen it; and then the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee demanded of </span>the thief to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">and he denied </span>the claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">brought witnesses </span>that he had stolen it, did <span class="gemarra-regular">the thief become exempt</span> from double payment <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">admission </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">owners, </span>as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when one admits liability to a penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bailee can say to the owners: Once you took your money </span>from me <span class="gemarra-regular">you removed yourselves from here </span>and have no further connection to this deposit. Therefore, I am now considered the owner of the stolen item and the right to the double payment is mine, and the thief’s admission to you is meaningless. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to him: Just as you performed a service for us </span>by paying us when you were not obligated, <span class="gemarra-regular">we performed </span>a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for you as well. </span>Instead of granting acquisition of the double payment to you, to enable you to be repaid <span class="gemarra-regular">we took the trouble </span>to search <span class="gemarra-regular">after the thief. We will take </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">ours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you take </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>the money you paid us. The Gemara comments: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>If an animal given as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen in circumstances beyond the control </span>of the bailee, who is therefore exempt from liability regardless of whether he was paid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the thief was recognized</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye says: If he is an unpaid bailee, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief, i.e., the bailee will pay the owner and then get reimbursed by the thief; and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath </span>that he was not responsible and the owner can demand his money from the thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is a paid bailee he enters </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief  <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not </span>have the option to <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath</span> to become exempt, as the responsibility to collect payment from the thief is part of his duty as a paid bailee. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Whether this </span>unpaid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">or that </span>paid bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">enters </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span>have the option to <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna bar Avin? As Rav Huna bar Avin sent </span>this ruling: If an animal given as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen in circumstances beyond the control </span>of the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">and the thief was recognized, if he is an unpaid bailee, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief; and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath </span>that he was not responsible, and the owner can demand his money from the thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he is a paid bailee, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he enters </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not </span>have the option to <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">that first </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath, </span>before the thief was recognized. The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>Rav Huna bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief; and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath </span>that he was not responsible, indicating that the bailee had not yet taken an oath. The Gemara answers: Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rav Huna bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>Having first taken an oath before the thief was recognized, if <span class="gemarra-regular">an unpaid bailee </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">remain with his oath </span>and not pay the owner, and if he so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span>he can choose to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment with </span>the thief.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba Zut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises the dilemma like this: </span>If an animal given as a deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen in circumstances beyond the control </span>of the bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thief returne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the animal to the place from where he had stolen it, and it is now <span class="gemarra-regular">in the house of the bailee, and it </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died through </span>the bailee’s <span class="gemarra-regular">negligence, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">once it was stolen in circumstances beyond </span>the bailee’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control his guardianship is completed </span>and he has no more responsibility for the animal, even for subsequent negligence? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps once it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">returned, it returned to his guardianship, </span>and an unpaid bailee is liable for loss resulting from negligence? The Gemara comments: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the owner asked the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deposit? </span>And the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And the owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>therefore accepting the oath; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he consumed it, </span>then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal. </span>If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that he had taken a false oath, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
If the owner asked the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is my deposit, </span>and the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It was stolen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and the owner said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I administer an oath to you, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amen, </span>therefore accepting the oath; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the witnesses testify about </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stole it, </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment of double </span>the principal. If the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted on his own </span>that he had taken a false oath, then he must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the principal, </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering.</span>
The mishna continues: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs his fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and the father demands that he return the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he takes an oath to</span> his father that he did not rob him; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the father <span class="gemarra-regular">dies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and then the son admits that he robbed him and took a false oath, necessitating the return of the principal and the giving of the additional one-fifth payment to his father’s heirs, of which he is either one of several or the only one; what should he do? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>son <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal and </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>father’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons or brothers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>brings <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering </span>and does not keep his own share. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he does not want </span>to forfeit his share <span class="gemarra-regular">or where he does not have </span>sufficient funds to pay the other heirs while forfeiting his share, he <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows </span>money in the amount of the value of the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">and the creditors com</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and are repaid </span>in part from his share in the stolen item.
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his son </span>in a vow: It is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">like an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and for that reason <span class="gemarra-regular">you may not derive benefit from my property, if </span>the father then <span class="gemarra-regular">dies </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>because it is no longer the father’s property once he dies. 

Daf 109a

The mishna continues: If the father stated in his vow that his son may not derive benefit from his property <span class="gemarra-regular">in his life and in his death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the father then <span class="gemarra-regular">dies </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the prohibition is still in effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>instead of taking his inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">he returns</span> his portion in the estate <span class="gemarra-regular">to his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to his brothers. And if he does not hav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> sufficient funds to subsist without his inheritance, he <span class="gemarra-regular">borrows </span>money in the amount of the value of his share in the inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors come and are repai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from his share.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> written in the mishna that one who robs his father pays the principal and the additional one-fifth payment to the father’s heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef says: </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>put this money <span class="gemarra-regular">in a charity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> if he so chooses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa says: And </span>when giving the money <span class="gemarra-regular">he must say: This </span>is what was <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">my father.</span>
§ The Gemara questions the mishna’s ruling that one who robs his father must return the stolen item to others even if he is the sole heir. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>must he do this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him forgive </span>the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself; </span>as the heir, to whom payment is due, he should be able to forgive it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (103a) that in the case of a robber who took a false oath claiming to be innocent and later admitted his liability: If the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">forgave him concerning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the principal, but did not forgive him concerning the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, he need not pursue him to repay the remaining debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>even the principal <span class="gemarra-regular">is subject to forgiveness, </span>so why doesn’t he forgive the obligation to himself?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. That </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </span>who says that this obligation can be forgiven, while <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna, ruling that a son who robbed his father and is his sole heir cannot forgive the obligation to himself, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who holds that this obligation cannot be forgiven.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:16) that the verse states with regard to one who steals from one who then died: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But if the man has no kinsman </span>to whom <span class="gemarra-regular">restitution may be made for the guilt, </span>the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” (Numbers 5:8). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is there </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">Jewish person who has no kinsmen? </span>Since every Jew descends from Jacob our forefather, all Jews have relatives to inherit from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert </span>who never married or had children as a Jew, and in any case is no longer legally related to his gentile family; he has no heirs. In this situation the Torah instructs one who robbed from a now-deceased convert to return the stolen item to a priest.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: In the case of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who robbed a convert and took </span>a false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath to him </span>saying that he did not rob him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that the convert died; and he was bringing his money, </span>for the principal and the additional one-fifth payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his guilt-offering up to Jerusalem </span>to pay his debt to the priests and sacrifice his offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he encountered that same convert, </span>who in fact had not died; <span class="gemarra-regular">and, </span>instead of having the robber pay the money right away the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">established it as a loan for </span>the robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> leaving his property ownerless, as he had no heirs; <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>robber <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession, </span>as it is now a loan, not money to pay back the theft; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The robber <span class="gemarra-regular">has no remedy until he will remove his stolen item from his possession.</span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains their respective opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if the one to whom payment is due forgives the return of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, </span>such as in this case of a convert who died or in the case of the mishna where a son robbed his father who then died, and there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if he forgives the return of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to others. </span>In either case, he <span class="gemarra-regular">can forgive </span>payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if the one to whom payment is due forgives the return of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to others </span>and there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no difference </span>if he forgives the return of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. </span>In either case, he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>payment.
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues his analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>HaGelili, <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would also be, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>no liability would remain in the case of the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">even had he not established</span> the robbery debt <span class="gemarra-regular">as a loan, </span>as the robber could forgive the obligation to himself once the convert died. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>its <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">established it as a loan for </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">is to convey to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva: That even </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">established it as a loan for him, </span>in which case it could be considered as though the robber had returned the stolen item and now has a standard loan debt, nevertheless, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">has no remedy until he will remove his stolen item from his possession, </span>so as to not benefit from his act of robbery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet objects to this </span>interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, let </span>the mishna on 103a, which indicates that one can forgive the principal payment of a robbery, <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>instead that the robbery victim can forgive the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, and </span>it would be understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>one can forgive the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to others. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>which Rabbi Yoḥanan explains to be the opinion stated in the mishna here, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach us that one cannot forgive </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to others, and </span>it would be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>with regard to the robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Sheshet said: That </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>mishna are both in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is saying that one can forgive </span>the return of a stolen item, he meant specifically forgiving the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to others, but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did this </span>one who robbed a convert who subsequently died <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession? Because </span>the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">established it as a loan for him, </span>and henceforth it is no longer considered stolen property, but a standard loan debt.
The Gemara offers a different explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: That </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>mishna are both in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. When Rabbi Akiva says that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot forgive </span>the return of a stolen item he meant specifically forgiving the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, </span>as in the case of the convert, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can forgive </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to others. </span>

Daf 109b

The Gemara questions Rava’s explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>does it follow <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">can forgive </span>the return of the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">even to himself? But </span>if so, payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a convert </span>who dies without heirs, about <span class="gemarra-regular">which the Merciful One says </span>that it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>repayment <span class="gemarra-regular">to the priests, how can you find these</span> circumstances if in every case where one robs a convert and the convert dies the robber can forgive the return of the item to himself?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: With what are we dealing here? </span>With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one robbed the convert and took an oath to him </span>that he did not rob him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the convert died, and </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">admitted </span>his false oath <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the convert’s <span class="gemarra-regular">death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such <span class="gemarra-regular">that at the time that he admitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Name, </span>i.e., God, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the principal and the additional one-fifth payment <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave it to the priests. </span>Once the right to the payment is transferred to the priests the robber can no longer forgive it. By contrast, if he admitted his false oath while the convert was still alive and then the convert dies, the convert can forgive the obligation to himself, since he already took ownership of it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raises a dilemma: </span>With regard to payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a female convert, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: “But if the <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>has no kinsman” (Numbers 5:8), indicating that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to a male convert, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>i.e., a female convert; if she dies after being robbed, payment is not given to the priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps it is the manner of the verse </span>to employ masculine wording, but the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies in the case of a female convert as well?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aharon said to Ravina: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to your dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states in its entirety: “But if the <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.” <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a man; from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>is it derived that this applies equally to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman? When it states: </span>“The restitution for guilt <span class="gemarra-regular">that is made,” there are two </span>instances of the phrase “that is made” <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>as the verse mentions making restitution twice, to include a female convert in this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">“man”? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains: To pay a convert who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a man, you need to investigat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concerning him </span>to determine <span class="gemarra-regular">if he has a kinsman or not, </span>but to pay a convert who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor you do not need to investigate concerning him. It is known that he has no kinsman, </span>since as a convert he has no kin among his birth family, and as a minor he does not have children.
§ With regard to the payment to priests in the case of one who robbed a convert who then died without heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>The verse states: “Restitution for guilt that is made <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” </span>(Numbers 5:8), teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Name, </span>i.e., God, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired it and gave it to the priest who is in that priestly watch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is given only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the priest who is on that priestly watch? Or </span>perhaps that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case, and <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>he may give it <span class="gemarra-regular">to any priest that he wishes? When it says </span>in that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him,” </span>this teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse speaks of </span>giving it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the priest who is on that priestly watch. </span>Just as the ram that the robber brings is given only to the priest on duty who sacrifices it, so too, the money is also given only to the priest on duty.
Concerning this payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">robs </span>the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">was a priest, from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that he shall not say: Since </span>the payment usually <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed </span>from the robber and given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the priests and it is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, it should be mine. And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a logical derivation </span>to support this reasoning, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has the right to acquire </span>the payment <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to others </span>who stole from a convert, then with regard to payment <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to himself, </span>which is already in his possession, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>that he should keep it?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan states </span>this logical inference <span class="gemarra-regular">with different wording: And just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter in which </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has no portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until it enters his possession, </span>e.g., <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, which can be given to any priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">once it enters his possession </span>another priest <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot remove it from his possession; </span>so too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has a portion </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">before it enters his possession, </span>e.g., an item stolen from a convert, in which he has a portion as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it logical that another </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot remove it from his possession </span>once it is in his possession?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, if you said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning a matter in which </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has no portion, </span>where the reason why once it enters his possession another priest cannot remove it from his possession is <span class="gemarra-regular">that just as he has no portion in it, so too, others have no portion in it; would you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>from a convert? As there it could be said <span class="gemarra-regular">that just as </span>the priest who robbed him <span class="gemarra-regular">has a portion in it </span>as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, other </span>priests on that watch <span class="gemarra-regular">have a portion in it. Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the item he stole is removed from his possession and is distribute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to all of his brethren, the priests.</span>
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: “And every man’s hallowed thing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be his; </span>whatsoever any man gives to the priest, it shall be his” (Numbers 5:10), indicating that a priest is not required to give to the other priests the offerings he sacrifices? Therefore, just as he has the right to the flesh of the guilt-offering that he brings to atone for robbing the convert, shouldn’t he also have the right to the payment? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here, </span>in this case? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a ritually impure priest, </span>who is unfit to sacrifice the guilt-offering and therefore does not have rights to the flesh of the offering. In this case, he will not be able to keep the payment for himself.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states its ruling specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an impure priest, </span>how can it describe the payment as <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter in which </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has a portion? Does he have </span>a portion in it? Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must not be referring to an impure priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>there is another reason why he has no right to the payment. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>through a verbal analogy between the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“even the priest’s [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lakohen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 5:8) written in this context, and the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“to the priest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lakohen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 27:21) <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse stated concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an ancestral field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which, if consecrated and then redeemed by another does not revert to its original owner in the Jubilee Year, but is given to the priests, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> will now explain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The possession thereof”? From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a field that goes out to the priests in the Jubilee </span>Year <span class="gemarra-regular">and one of the priests redeemed it </span>before the Jubilee Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not say: Since </span>a field that is redeemed by another <span class="gemarra-regular">goes out to the priests in the Jubilee </span>Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the field that I redeemed <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">in my possession, it should be mine, </span>and not be given to the priests in general?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a logical derivation </span>to support this reasoning, as follows: If <span class="gemarra-regular">I acquire </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to others, </span>who consecrated it and it was then redeemed, then with regard to a field <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to me, </span>which is already in my possession, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>that I should keep it?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “As a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” </span>(Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a field of which the priest has <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>from his ancestors <span class="gemarra-regular">is his, but this </span>field that he redeemed <span class="gemarra-regular">is not his. How so? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed from his possession and is distributed to all of his brethren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara records another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning the rights of a priest to offerings he sacrifices. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 13:17): <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a priest </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">come and sacrifice his offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at any time and at any hour that he wishes </span>and does not have to wait for his priestly watch to serve in the Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“And if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourns, <span class="gemarra-regular">and comes with all the desire of his soul </span>unto the place that the Lord shall choose; <span class="gemarra-regular">then he shall minister </span>in the name of the Lord his God” (Deuteronomy 18:6–7).
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the performance of </span>the offering’s <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>i.e., eating the meat of the animal he sacrifices, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the offering’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hide, belong to him? The verse states: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his” </span>(Numbers 5:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? If </span>this priest <span class="gemarra-regular">was blemished</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he gives </span>his offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">priest that is on the same priestly watch </span>as him to sacrifice it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the performance of its service and its hide belong to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 110a

The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he was old or sick</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that he cannot perform the Temple service or eat from the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives it to any priest he wishes </span>to sacrifice it, even to one not on his priestly watch, <span class="gemarra-regular">and performance of its service and its hide </span>are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> members of the priestly watch.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this old or sick </span>priest? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is in a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is able to perform </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">performance of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its service and its hide should be his as well, </span>as the priest that sacrificed it was acting as his agent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he is in a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is not able to perform </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, how can he appoint an agent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that he may give it to any priest he wishes, indicating that he chooses which priest he will appoint as his agent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is able to do </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficulty. </span>With regard to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, where </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he performs it with difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>still considered performance of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>he is therefore able to <span class="gemarra-regular">appoint an agent </span>to do it for him. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">eating </span>the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> says that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he eats </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficulty it is excessive eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and excessive eating is nothing, </span>i.e., he does not thereby fulfill the mitzva to eat the sacrificial portion, he is not able to appoint an agent to eat it for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to that </span>reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">performance of its service and its hide </span>are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">members of the priestly watch.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet says: If a priest </span>of the priestly watch <span class="gemarra-regular">was ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a communal offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives it to any </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">he wishes, and performance of its service and its hide </span>are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the members of the priestly watch. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies? <span class="gemarra-regular">If there are ritually pure </span>priests available, then <span class="gemarra-regular">can impure ones perform </span>the Temple service, and by extension appoint an agent to perform it in their stead? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are no ritually pure </span>priests there, as all members of the priestly watch are impure, is the <span class="gemarra-regular">performance of its service and its hide </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the members of the priestly watch? </span>Even though communal offerings are sacrificed in such a circumstance, the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are impure and are not able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the offering, even though they may sacrifice it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that they are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to blemished </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">who are on that priestly watch. </span>Even though blemished priests are disqualified from performing the Temple service and therefore the offering must be sacrificed by impure priests, the blemished priests are permitted to eat the sacrifice, as they are ritually pure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: If a High Priest was an acute mourner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one whose immediate relative died on that day but had yet to be buried, and he had an offering to sacrifice on his own behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to any priest that he wishes </span>to sacrifice it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and performance of its service and its hide </span>are given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the members of the priestly watch. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>Rav Ashi’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Zevaḥim</span> 11:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">A High Priest may sacrifice </span>an offering even when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an acute mourner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he does not eat </span>it during that day while he is an acute mourner <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not </span>receive <span class="gemarra-regular">a portion </span>of the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat at nigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> after his acute mourning is finished. It follows from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that since he sacrifices it by himself he is able to appoint another priest in his stead, and since he may not eat it, it is given to the priestly watch to eat. What, then, was the novelty of Rav Ashi’s statement?
The Gemara answers: It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when the Merciful One had compassion on the High Priest, </span>permitting him to continue serving in the Temple even while in a state of acute mourning, it was for <span class="gemarra-regular">him to sacrifice; but </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to appointing an agent, he is not able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">appoint </span>one. Therefore, Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he is able to appoint an agent, since he himself is permitted to perform the Temple service.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs a convert and takes a </span>false <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>denying having done so, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the robber, in order to achieve repentance, <span class="gemarra-regular">pays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal, </span>i.e., the stolen item or, if it is no longer extant, its monetary value, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>of its value <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>presents <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering to the altar, as it is stated: “But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him” </span>(Numbers 5:8).
The mishna continues: If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">was bringing the money and the guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up </span>to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">and he die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> before paying the priests and bringing his offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">the money shall be given to </span>the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span>animal designated for the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering shall graze until it becomes blemished </span>and consequently disqualified from being sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be sold and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>received <span class="gemarra-regular">for it shall be allocated for </span>communal <span class="gemarra-regular">gift </span>offerings. If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the money to the members of the priestly watc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>before they sacrificed his guilt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">the heirs cannot remove </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the priests’ <span class="gemarra-regular">possession, as it is stated: </span>“And every man’s hallowed things shall be his; <span class="gemarra-regular">whatsoever any man gives to the priest, it shall be his” </span>(Numbers 5:10).
The mishna continues: If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the money to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiari</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then gave the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, </span>the following priestly watch, to sacrifice on his behalf, he has <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>his obligation. By contrast, if he first gave the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib and </span>then gave the <span class="gemarra-regular">money to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, if </span>the animal designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">the guilt-offering </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">extant, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">members of </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, </span>who received the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">should sacrifice it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>longer extant because the priestly watch of Joiarib had already sacrificed it, he <span class="gemarra-regular">should return and bring another guilt-offering; for one who brings his stolen item </span>to the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">brings his guilt-offering </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>his obligation, but one who <span class="gemarra-regular">brings his guilt-offering before </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">brings his stolen ite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> has <span class="gemarra-regular">not fulfilled </span>his obligation.
Although he cannot sacrifice the offering before paying the principal, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave the principal but did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">give the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, the lack of having given <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">does not preclude </span>sacrificing the offering.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in explanation of the verse cited in the mishna: “But if the man has no kinsman…the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” (Numbers 5:8): With regard to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal, </span>i.e., the stolen item itself or its equivalent value; <span class="gemarra-regular">“the restitution…that is made,” this </span>is referring to the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the proper interpretation of the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should be interpreted: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Guilt,” this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram </span>of the guilt-offering.
Before continuing the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the Gemara interrupts to clarify: <span class="gemarra-regular">And for what purpose</span> does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> distinguish between the two interpretations of guilt, as in any event, both the principal and the guilt-offering must be brought? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">To exclude that which Rava </span>holds, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava says: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item of a convert that </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">returned at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill </span>his obligation. And similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned it to him </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">halves, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled </span>the stolen item with the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” </span>teaching that just as a guilt-offering cannot be offered at night or in halves, so too, the stolen item cannot be returned at night or in halves.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it says </span>in that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the ram of the atonement” </span>(Numbers 5:8), referring to the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">you must say </span>concerning the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt” </span>written earlier in the verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal; “the restitution…that is made,” this </span>is referring to the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the proper interpretation of the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should be interpreted: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Guilt,” this </span>is referring to the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment. Before continuing the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara interrupts to clarify: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what purpose </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> distinguish between the two interpretations? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">To</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>teaches, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">gave him the principal but did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">give him the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, the lack of having given <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">does not preclude </span>sacrificing the offering. If “guilt” is referring to the additional one-fifth payment, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the contrary, </span>it would follow that the lack of having given the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">precludes </span>sacrificing the offering.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it says </span>in the previous verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and </span>add unto it <span class="gemarra-regular">the fifth part thereof” </span>(Numbers 5:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">you must say </span>concerning the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt” </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” this </span>is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal; “the restitution…that is made,” this </span>is referring to the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert. Or </span>perhaps this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the proper interpretation of the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should be interpreted: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The restitution…that is made,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">double payment </span>that a thief must pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the verse is speaking of theft from a convert. When it says </span>in the previous verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and </span>add unto it <span class="gemarra-regular">the fifth part thereof” </span>(Numbers 5:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of money that is paid </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the principal, </span>and not double payment.
§ Having quoted Rava’s statement, the Gemara returns to discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rava says: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item of a convert that </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">returned at night, </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill </span>his obligation. And similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned it to him </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">halves, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled </span>the stolen item with the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” </span>teaching that just as a guilt-offering cannot be offered at night or in halves, so too, the stolen item cannot be returned at night or in halves.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item of a convert that does not have the value of one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perut</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every pries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on the priestly watch, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill his obligation </span>by giving it to the priestly watch. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? As it is written: “The restitution for guilt that is made,” </span>meaning that the robber has not fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">until there will be </span>halakhically significant <span class="gemarra-regular">restitution made to each and every priest, </span>minimally one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>. If the stolen item was of less value than can be distributed with each priest in the watch receiving at least one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>, the robber must add to the payment so that each priest receives one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>.
Based on this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>If the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>the value of one <span class="it-text">peruta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>each priest on <span class="gemarra-regular">the priestly watch of Joiarib, </span>which had many priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it has</span>

Daf 110b

the value of one <span class="it-text">peruta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>each priest on the <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly watch of Jedaiah, </span>which had fewer priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>with regard to which Rava raised his dilemma? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the dilemma is raised in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gave </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, during </span>the time of the Temple service of the <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly watch of Jedaiah, </span>there would be no dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">There is in </span>this payment enough value for each priest to receive one <span class="it-text">peruta</span>.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to raise the dilemma in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gave it to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah </span>priestly watch <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the time of the Temple service of the <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly watch of Joiarib; </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara explains the two possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is not </span>during Jedaiah’s <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly watch, it is nothing, </span>i.e., it is not a fulfillment of the mitzva to return the stolen item? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it was not fit for </span>the Joiarib priestly watch, as it was of insufficient value, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset it stands </span>ready <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah </span>priestly watch, and by giving it to them he fulfilled the mitzva? The Gemara comments: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">priests, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they may divide </span>among themselves the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a convert, </span>with some priests taking a larger share <span class="gemarra-regular">in exchange for </span>taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert? </span>In other words, can the priests arrange that one priest or several priests will receive the restitution for one robbery and another priest or several priests will receive the restitution for a different robbery another time?
He explains the two possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One labeled </span>the stolen item with the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” </span>and therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">may not divide </span>portions of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with some priests taking a larger share <span class="gemarra-regular">in exchange for </span>taking a smaller share in other portions of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering, </span>but rather all priests of the watch share in the sacrificial flesh, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>with the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery: </span>The priests <span class="gemarra-regular">may not divide </span>the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert, </span>with some priests taking a larger share <span class="gemarra-regular">in exchange for </span>taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert? Or perhaps </span>the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert </span>paid to priests is not in fact an offering, but it <span class="gemarra-regular">is monetary restitution, </span>and monetary restitution may be divided in this manner among the priests?
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">then resolves it </span>himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One labeled </span>the stolen item with the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt,” </span>so it may not be divided in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it explicitly </span>as a ruling, and not as a dilemma and solution, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: Priests may not divide </span>the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a conver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with some priests taking a larger share <span class="gemarra-regular">in exchange for </span>taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert. What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled </span>the stolen item with the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt.”</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: </span>What is the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">priests with regard to </span>the restitution for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert? Are they </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs </span>of the convert <span class="gemarra-regular">or are they recipients of gifts?</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference? </span>The Gemara answers: The difference would be in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one robbed </span>a convert of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover elapsed over it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> rendering it an item from which one is prohibited to derive benefit and therefore valueless. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are heirs, this is what they inherit: </span>Only that which the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">bequeath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to them, and the priests receive the valueless leavened bread as is. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are recipients of gifts, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift that the Merciful One is saying that </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">should give to them, and this </span>robber <span class="gemarra-regular">is not giving them anything, for it is merely dust. </span>Therefore, the robber should have to pay the priests what the value of the bread had been at the time of the robbery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zeira raises the dilemma like this: Even if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are recipients of gifts, this </span>question, i.e., whether a robber of leavened bread over which Passover then elapsed fulfills the mitzva to return the stolen item even in this devalued state, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not our dilemma, </span>as this is certainly a fulfillment of the obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">For this </span>stolen item is the <span class="gemarra-regular">gift </span>with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">should give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priests.
Rav Zeira continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, when we have a dilemma </span>whether the priests are considered as heirs or as recipients of gifts, the practical difference arises in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where ten animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came into </span>the priest’s possession <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert. </span>The dilemma is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are they obligated to separate tithe from them, or not?</span>
The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">they are heirs, </span>in which case they will be obligated, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the Master said </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 56b) that if heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the jointly <span class="gemarra-regular">held </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the estate,</span> i.e., the heirs jointly owned the animals as the inheritance had yet to be divided, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are obligated </span>to separate tithes from animals born to those animals, and the same will apply to the priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps they are recipients of gifts, and we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 55b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who purchases </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or one who </span>has an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">given to him as a gift </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>the obligation to separate the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the same will apply to the priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Ḥalla</span> 2:7–10): <span class="gemarra-regular">Twenty-four priestly gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were given to Aaron and to his sons, and all of them were given with </span>a derivation from <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; and </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a covenant of salt. </span>The verses in the book of Numbers, chapter 18, detail the gifts of the priesthood. The first verse (18:8) is written in general terms, followed by verses listing the actual gifts (9–18), followed by a final verse written in general terms. The method of interpreting verses written in this manner is one of the thirteen hermeneutical principles. Additionally, the phrase: “Covenant of salt,” is written in the final verse (18:19), and is referring to all of the gifts of the priesthood.
This serves to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who fulfills </span>the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he fulfills </span>the entire Torah, which is interpreted using the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a detail, and a generalization; and </span>as if he has brought all of the offerings, concerning which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a covenant of salt. And anyone who violates </span>the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he violates </span>the entire Torah, which is interpreted using the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; and </span>as if he has not brought all of the offerings, concerning which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a covenant of salt.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the twenty-four gifts: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">ten in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and four in Jerusalem, and ten in the boundaries</span> of Eretz Yisrael. The <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>gifts that the priests consume only <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal sin-offering; and a bird sin-offering; and a definite guilt-offering; and a provisional guilt-offering; and communal peace-offerings, </span>i.e., lambs offered on <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of oil </span>that accompanies the guilt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a recovered <span class="gemarra-regular">leper; and the surplus of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., what remains of the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the two loaves, </span>i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat offered on <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the shewbread; and the leftovers of grain-offerings, </span>after the priests have offered the required handful.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>gifts that the priests consume anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem: The firstbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of kosher animals; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the first fruits; and the </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">separated </span>for the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">from the thanks-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the nazirite’s ram; and hides of consecrated </span>animals.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And ten </span>gifts that the priests consume anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">in the boundaries </span>of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-italic">Teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the portion of the produce designated for the priest; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe, </span>which the Levite separates from the tithe he receives and gives to a priest; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the portion of dough of the five main grains designated for the priest; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the first of the sheared </span>wool; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the gifts </span>of non-sacrificial, slaughtered animals, namely, the right foreleg, the cheeks, and the maw; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>money given for the <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption of </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">son; and </span>a sheep or goat given as <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption of the firstborn donkey; and </span>a consecrated <span class="gemarra-regular">ancestral field </span>the priests receive in the Jubilee Year; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a dedicated field; and </span>payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery of a convert </span>who died without heirs.
The Gemara infers from the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in any event, labels </span>the payment for robbery of a convert <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the priests who receive it <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">recipients of gifts, </span>and not heirs. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the money to the members of the priestly watch </span>and then died before they sacrificed his guilt-offering, the heirs cannot remove the money from the priests’ possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from </span>this mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary restitution</span> for the robbery <span class="gemarra-regular">atones </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> of the sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">for if </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not atone </span>at all, and atonement is not achieved until the guilt-offering is sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that in the case of robbery of a convert, if the guilt-offering is not brought the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heirs. What is the reason </span>I would say this? Because <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not give </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">with this intention </span>of giving the money and not achieving atonement at all, and it would be a mistaken transaction.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>it would follow that <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose owners have died, </span>leaving no one to bring the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">should be transferred to non-sacred </span>status, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">did not separate</span> the animal as an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">with this intention </span>of its not being sacrificed to atone for his sin. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose owners have died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through traditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is left to die.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, a guilt-offering whose owner has die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be transferred to non-sacred </span>status, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not separate </span>the animal as an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">with this intention </span>of it not being sacrificed to atone for his sin. The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt-offering, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">also learned this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through tradition: Any </span>occurrence <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>if it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a sin-offering </span>the animal is placed in isolation for it to <span class="gemarra-regular">die, </span>if it occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a guilt-offering </span>the animal is left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze </span>until it develops a blemish precluding its use as an offering, at which point it can be redeemed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman whose husband died childless</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], who happened before </span>her late husband’s brother who was <span class="gemarra-regular">afflicted with boil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to enter levirate marriage with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">should go out </span>free to marry <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>being required to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">the ritual through which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> frees the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of her levirate bonds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. For she did not betroth herself </span>to this man’s deceased brother <span class="gemarra-regular">with this intention </span>of having a levirate bond with a man afflicted with boils. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, it is clear to us</span>

Daf 111a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that it is satisfactory for her to </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>kind of marital arrangement, and even had she taken into consideration the possibility of entering a levirate bond with this <span class="it-text">yavam</span> who is afflicted with boils she still would have accepted betrothal to her husband. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish says </span>that women have a saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is better to sit </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">two bodies [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tan</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">du</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to be married, <span class="gemarra-regular">than to sit </span>lonely like <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the money to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib </span>and then gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, the following priestly watch, to sacrifice on his behalf, he has fulfilled his obligation. By contrast, if he first gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Joiarib and then gave the money to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, if the guilt-offering is extant, then members of the priestly watch of Jedaiah, who received the money, should sacrifice it. The Gemara quotes a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that records a dispute between <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> concerning this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:18): If the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">gave the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib and </span>then gave <span class="gemarra-regular">the money</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">should return the money </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., with the priestly watch of Joiarib; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say </span>the opposite: They <span class="gemarra-regular">should return the guilt-offering </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the money, </span>and the priestly watch of Jedaiah will sacrifice it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this dispute? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that he gave the guilt-offering to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib during the priestly watch of Joiarib and the money to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah during the priestly watch of Jedaiah, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired that which belongs to it and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired that which belongs to it. </span>Why would the court remove what was given lawfully to the priestly watch?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he gave the guilt-offering to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib during the priestly watch of Joiarib and the money to </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">during the priestly watch of Joiarib, </span>and the dispute is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since this is not the priestly watch of Jedaiah, we penalize Jedaiah; therefore, </span>the priestly watch of Jedaiah must <span class="gemarra-regular">return the money </span>in their possession <span class="gemarra-regular">to be with the guilt-offering </span>held by the Joiarib watch. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the members of </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib acted unlawfully when they accepted the guilt-offering before </span>the robber paid <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>since payment for the robbery must be given before the guilt-offering can be offered. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, we penalize them, and the guilt-offering </span>in their possession <span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the money </span>held by the Jedaiah watch.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> on this topic (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:18): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>that if during the Joiarib watch the robber gave the guilt-offering to the Joiarib watch and the money to the Jedaiah watch, the money should return to the priestly watch of Joiarib, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the members of </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib went first and sacrificed the guilt-offering </span>before receiving the money from the priestly watch of Jedaiah, then the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">should go back and bring another guilt-offering,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the members of </span>the priestly watch of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jedaiah, </span>who are already in possession of the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">should offer it, and those </span>members of the priestly watch of Joiarib <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired that </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that is in their possession.</span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: For what </span>purpose is that offering <span class="gemarra-regular">useful? It is a disqualified guilt-offering, </span>since it was sacrificed before the payment for the robbery was given, and had to be entirely burned on the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>acquiring <span class="gemarra-regular">its hide, </span>which the members of the priestly watch of Joiarib keep.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, if the guilt-offering is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">extant, </span>i.e., if the priestly watch of Joiarib did not already sacri-fice it, then the priestly watch of Joiarib <span class="gemarra-regular">should return the guilt-offering </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the money, </span>and the priestly watch of Jedaiah will sacrifice it.
The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">should return </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the guilt-offering. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">that the priestly watch of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Joiarib exited </span>at the close of their Temple service <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not demand </span>the money from the priestly watch of Jedaiah. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: That </span>by doing so, the members of the priestly watch of Joiarib <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>their rights to the money <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of </span>the priestly watch of Jedaiah. Consequently, they are required to give the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Jedaiah to sacrifice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, if the guilt-offering is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">extant,</span> i.e., if the priestly watch of Joiarib did not already sacrifice it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the money </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">with the guilt-offering. </span>The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? This is </span>what Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>explicitly; what novelty did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi teach?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it happened <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the priestly watch of these and of those, </span>i.e., both Joiarib and Jedaiah, <span class="gemarra-regular">exited </span>at the end of their Temple service, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not demand </span>of the other the item in possession of the other watch. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they waived </span>their rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of each other, </span>so that the money stays in possession of the Jedaiah watch, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that we say: Since </span>the Jedaiah watch <span class="gemarra-regular">did not demand </span>the guilt-offering from the Joiarib watch after the latter exited, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them go back to the first, </span>standard scenario, returning the money to Joiarib to be with the guilt-offering.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">For one who brings his stolen item </span>to the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">before he brings his guilt-offering </span>has fulfilled his obligation, but one who brings his guilt-offering before he brings his stolen item has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: </span>“But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, <span class="gemarra-regular">the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him” </span>(Numbers 5:8). Learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money </span>must be returned <span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>before the guilt-offering is brought.
Having understood that the inference is that the wording “besides the ram of the atonement” indicates that the ram must be brought after the money is given, <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the Sages said to Rava: If that is so, </span>then in a different verse, which states concerning the additional offerings sacrificed on the first day of Passover: “You shall offer these <span class="gemarra-regular">besides the burnt-offering of the morning, </span>which is for a continual burnt-offering” (Numbers 28:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>should one learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that the additional offerings </span>are brought <span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>before the morning burnt-offering?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that no </span>sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">shall precede the daily morning offering? The verse states: </span>“And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood upon it every morning, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it </span>and shall cause the fats of the peace-offerings to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: “The burnt-offering,” </span>with the definite article, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the daily morning offering, which is first both chronologically and in terms of importance.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I do not hold that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> derives this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the wording of: “Besides the ram of the atonement,” but <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span> hold that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derives it from </span>the phrase in the same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whereby atonement shall be made for him” </span>(Numbers 5:8), which is written in the future tense, indicating that he will achieve atonement in the future by bringing the ram of atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>as of now, when he is giving payment for the robbery, the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">did not yet atone </span>for his sin.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave the principal to him </span>but did not yet give the additional one-fifth payment, his not giving it does not preclude sacrificing the offering. The Gemara now clarifies the source of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> on the topic of the guilt-offering brought by one who misuses consecrated property, which is accompanied by repayment of the value of the item and an additional fifth of its value: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he brought his </span>payment for his benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not bring his guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if he brought <span class="gemarra-regular">his guilt-offering but did not bring his </span>payment for his benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">misus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of consecrated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not fulfill </span>his obligation?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’asham</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and he shall be forgiven” </span>(Leviticus 5:16). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> interprets the phrase: “The ram of the guilt-offering,” to be referring to two entities: The ram, i.e., the offering, and the payment, represented by the words “the guilt-offering”; this teaches that forgiveness and atonement are achieved only after both the ram of the guilt-offering is sacrificed and the restitution of the monetary payment is given.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he brought his guilt-offering before bringing his </span>payment for his benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not fulfill </span>his obligation? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">the guilt-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was already </span>brought.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the ram and guilt-offering, </span>i.e., payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">preclude </span>his achieving atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>payment of the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>of the value <span class="gemarra-regular">precludes </span>his achieving it. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven,” </span>which teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ram and guilt-offering, </span>i.e., payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">preclude </span>his achieving atonement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to consecrated </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the payment of the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth does not preclude </span>his achieving it.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">be learned from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>money, i.e., payment for robbery of a convert who died without heirs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>let the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>money be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property.
In what manner? The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property can be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>money as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt” that is </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the context of robbery of a convert, is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal,</span> i.e., the payment itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“guilt” that is </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the context of misuse of consecrated property, is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">principal. And </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>money can be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">does not preclude </span>his achieving atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">one-fifth </span>payment <span class="gemarra-regular">does not preclude </span>his achieving atonement.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owners </span>of the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came, </span>took it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">and ate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes he may collect from this one, </span>i.e., the first robber, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he wishes he may collect from that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the second robber. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he may collect from whomever he chooses? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as the owners did not despair </span>of retrieving it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it remains the possession of its owner, </span>so that when the second robber stole it from the first, he was in fact stealing from the original owner. Nevertheless, since the first robber was already obligated to return the item, his obligation remains in force and the owner may demand payment from him if he wishes.
The Gemara questions this opinion based on what <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to his children, or </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance, the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from paying </span>the victim of the robbery after their father’s death. This appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who holds that one who steals from a thief is obligated to pay the owner. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: When that </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it is addressing a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owners had already <span class="gemarra-regular">despaire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> of retrieving the item, whereas Rav Ḥisda was referring to a case where the owners had not yet despaired.
§ The mishna stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">if one left </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his children as an inheritance, the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from paying </span>the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser. </span>Just as an item that is purchased leaves the domain of the seller, an item that is inherited leaves the domain of the deceased and is considered the property of the heir. Since the owner has despaired of retrieving the item and the item has changed domains, it is entirely the property of the new owner, and he is exempt from payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the domain of an hei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not comparable to the domain of a purchaser. </span>Consequently, the item has not undergone a complete change of ownership and the heir would be required to return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the explanation of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>the stolen goods, so there is nothing to return to the owner.
The Gemara questions the opinion of Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the fact </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause teaches: If it was something that serves </span>as a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>and is, therefore, an existing commodity, the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to pay, it may be inferred that </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause we are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with a stolen item that is extant. </span>This is contrary to Rava’s statement that the mishna is discussing stolen goods that have been consumed. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If their father left them guaranteed property, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are obligated to pay </span>from that property, even if the stolen item is not extant.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">teach Rabbi Shimon, his son, </span>that this mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring only to <span class="gemarra-regular">something that may actually serve </span>as a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>i.e., land? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he plows with, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he drives </span>by directing it from <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, </span>which the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to return because of the honor of their father. </span>This indicates that the mishna is referring to stolen property that is extant, and not to land.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When I die, Rabbi Oshay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will come toward me </span>from his place in heaven in order to greet me, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I explain the mishna in accordance with his </span>opinion and thereby honor him. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Oshaya taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>the stolen goods to <span class="gemarra-regular">his children, </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from paying </span>the owner. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the stolen item is extant, </span>the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated </span>to return it to the owner; if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not extant, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them guaranteed property, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are obligated to pay </span>the owner. Rava explains the mishna as being consistent with the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rabbi Oshaya, although this explanation is not consistent with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s interpretation.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rabbi Oshaya. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is not extant, </span>the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt </span>from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who says that heirs are obligated to pay for stolen goods that they consumed. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it is referring to a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the owners had already <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving the item, whereas Rav Ḥisda was referring to a case in which the owners had not yet despaired.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen item is extant, </span>the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to pay. Let us say that </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rami bar Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since according to his understanding, the heirs should be exempt from payment because the stolen item is considered to have changed ownership when they inherited it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>

Daf 112a

it is referring to a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the owners have <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving their property. Consequently, the heirs have not acquired the stolen property, and it must be returned.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava teaches that </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rami bar Ḥama </span>cited above <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them money </span>that he obtained by taking <span class="gemarra-regular">interest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they are aware that </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">interest, they are not obligated to return </span>the money to the debtor who paid it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser, </span>and because the money has changed domains, the heirs have acquired it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, I will say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the domain of an heir is not comparable to the domain of a purchaser. And </span>the reason they do not have to return the money is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different here, as the verse states: “Take no interest of him or increase, </span>but fear your God, that your brother may live with you” (Leviticus 25:36), which teaches that you must <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>the interest <span class="gemarra-regular">to him so that he may live with you. </span>Since the interest is returned for this reason and not because it is considered stolen goods, it is apparent that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is cautioning him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the lender, to return it, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is not cautioning his son </span>to return it.
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches </span>Rami bar Ḥama’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rav Adda bar Ahava, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>would apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>since there is no other explanation for why the heirs are exempt from payment. Conversely, according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who teaches </span>Rami bar Ḥama’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the mishna, </span>it is limited to that case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama teaches it as </span>explained by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>that the heirs are not exempt from payment because the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser, but rather because heirs are never required to return interest.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 10:21): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">his children, </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from paying </span>the owner. In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>the stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance, if the heirs are <span class="gemarra-regular">adults they are obligated to pay, </span>and if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">minors they are exempt from paying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If the adult </span>heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">said: We do not know </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">calculations our father made with you </span>and whether he paid you for the stolen goods, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are exempt.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because they say: We do not know, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt? </span>Since it is clear that they are in possession of stolen property, how can they be exempt due to the uncertain claim that perhaps their father repaid the owner after the theft? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that the heirs are certain about their claim and that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be formulated differently, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">adult </span>heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">who sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the claimant: <span class="gemarra-regular">We know the calculations our father made with you and there is nothing of yours left with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he paid his debt to you, they <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt.</span>
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">his children, </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">and they consumed them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated </span>to pay the owner. The Gemara asks: Are <span class="gemarra-regular">minors obligated </span>to pay? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be only </span>like a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one caused damage, </span>and a minor who causes damage is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be formulated differently, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>the stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not yet consume them, whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated </span>to return the stolen items, since the items are still extant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>In the case of children whose <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>died and <span class="gemarra-regular">left them a cow </span>that he had <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they may use it for the entire duration of its loan. </span>Nevertheless, if it <span class="gemarra-regular">died, they are not liable </span>to pay if its death was caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">an unavoidable accident</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the fact that a borrower is liable for damage caused by an unavoidable accident. This is because liability for accidental damage pertains only to the actual borrower, i.e., the deceased father. If the children <span class="gemarra-regular">thought that it </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to their father and they slaughtered it and ate it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>are liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">the value of inexpensive meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava adds: If <span class="gemarra-regular">their father left them guaranteed property, </span>i.e., land, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are liable to pay.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some teach this </span>final statement of Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the first clause, </span>which states that the heirs are exempt from payment for accidental damage. According to this interpretation, if the father left them land, they are obligated to pay for the cow if it dies due to unavoidable accident. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some teach it with regard to the latter clause, </span>which states that heirs who slaughter and consume a cow must pay the owner the value of inexpensive meat. According to this interpretation, if the father left them land, they must pay for the full value of the cow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches it with regard to the first clause </span>holds it to be true <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so with regard to the latter clause, </span>where the heirs actually consumed the meat themselves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>accordingly, this understanding <span class="gemarra-regular">differs </span>with the forthcoming opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappa. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who teaches it with regard to the latter claus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> holds it to be true in that clause exclusively, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to the first clause, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>true. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>consistent with the forthcoming opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Pappa says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he had a stolen co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> in his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he slaughtered it on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was already rendered liable </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">theft before he came to </span>transgress the <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat prohibition </span>of slaughtering an animal on Shabbat. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he had a borrowed co</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">and he slaughtered it on Shabbat, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the transgression of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Shabbat prohibition </span>of slaughtering an animal on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">and the prohibition against theft </span>occur <span class="gemarra-regular">as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the act of slaughter is tantamount to the theft of the animal. This indicates that according to Rav Pappa, a borrower’s liability to pay for accidental damage is initiated only when the damage is inflicted. Accordingly, in the case discussed by Rava, since the damage was not inflicted during the father’s lifetime, the deceased’s property was never liened to the cow’s owner, and consequently the heirs are not obligated to pay for any accidental damage.
After having cited two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> that express different opinions with regard to the obligation of heirs to pay for property stolen by their deceased father, the Gemara cites a third <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that presents both opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>with regard to the verse: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</span> (Leviticus 5:23); <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “that he robbed”? </span>It means that the robber must <span class="gemarra-regular">return the same </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that he robbed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From here, </span>based on this exposition, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span>another of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">his children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the children are <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying </span>the owner. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>stolen goods <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated </span>to return the stolen goods. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said in the name of Sumakhos: </span>If the heirs are <span class="gemarra-regular">adults </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated, </span>but if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">minors </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt.</span>
The Gemara recounts a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">The son of Rabbi Yirmeya’s father-in-law, </span>i.e., his wife’s brother, who was a minor, <span class="gemarra-regular">shut the doors </span>of his father’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yirmeya </span>in order to prevent Rabbi Yirmeya from establishing legal possession of the house or a chamber that he claimed belonged to him. Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Avin </span>to file a legal claim against his brother-in-law.
Rabbi Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to Rabbi Yirmeya: Your brother-in-law is <span class="gemarra-regular">claiming </span>ownership of that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he retains the presumptive ownership of his father’s house upon his father’s death. Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But I can bring witnesses who can testify that I took possession of it during his father’s lifetime. </span>Rabbi Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But does </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">accept witnesses</span>

Daf 112b

who testify <span class="gemarra-regular">in the absence of a litigant? </span>Since the defendant is a minor his presence is not legally recognized, and the court does not accept testimony against him. Rabbi Yirmeya questioned this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accept such testimony? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>that if a robber leaves stolen goods to his children, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated </span>to pay the owner? If the court obligates minors to pay, it must accept testimony about them. Rabbi Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos’s dispute is at your side, </span>i.e., Sumakhos disagrees with this ruling and holds that the minors are exempt from paying. Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did the whole world go to the effort to hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to seize what is mine?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the meantime, the matter circulated and </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Abbahu, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Did you not hear that which Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya </span>says? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a child who took his slave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and descended into the field of another and said: It is mine, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say: Let us wait until he matures </span>before we assess his claims. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">removes it from his possession immediately, and when he matures he may bring witnesses </span>to attest to his claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and we will see </span>how to judge the case. Similarly, Rabbi Yirmeya should be awarded the disputed property until his minor brother-in-law may litigate in court.
The Gemara rejects Rabbi Abbahu’s assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the case that Rav Yosef bar Ḥama discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable </span>to the case of Rabbi Yirmeya? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is there, </span>in Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s case, <span class="gemarra-regular">that we seize </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, because there is no presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">from his father; but where he does have a presumption </span>of ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">from his father, no, </span>we do not seize his property. Since Rabbi Yirmeya’s brother-in-law has a presumption of ownership due to the fact that the property belonged to his father, he retains control of the property.
§ Having mentioned the issue of testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara discusses this matter in greater detail. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shabbtai says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The court <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts witnesses </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in the absence of a litigant. Rabbi Yoḥanan wondered at this </span>statement of Rav Ashi, and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the court in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">accept witnesses in the absence of a litigant?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina received </span>the following guideline <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: The court accepts testimony in the absence of the defendant only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the plaintiff <span class="gemarra-regular">was ill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or his witnesses were ill, or his witnesses wished to travel overseas and </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>for the defendant <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not come</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since there is a concern that the plaintiff will not be able to present his claims at a later date, the testimony is accepted even in the absence of the defendant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts witnesses in the absence of a litigant. Mar Ukva said: </span>This statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">by Shmuel himself, </span>and he said that it applies in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">opened his case and sent for him, but he did not appear. But </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">open the case for him, he may say to </span>the plaintiff: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am going to the High Cour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to resolve this case and will not appear in the local court.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then even <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the court already <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">say to them: I am going to the High Court </span>to resolve this case. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>The defendant may not defer an opened case to the High Court if, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>the local court <span class="gemarra-regular">obtained a license from the High Court </span>authorizing it to adjudicate the case.
§ Having discussed testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara addresses a similar matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">ratifies a documen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the absence of a litigant. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not ratify a document in the absence of a litigant. Rav Sheshet said to Rabbi Yosei bar Abbahu: I will explain Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reasonin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you. The verse states </span>with regard to an ox that gored: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And warning has been given to its owner and he has not secured it” </span>(Exodus 21:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah </span>means to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Let <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the ox come and stand by his ox </span>when the testimony about the ox is provided. Similarly, a document may be ratified only in the presence of the individual it implicates.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant, and </span>this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the other litigant <span class="gemarra-regular">stands and screams </span>in protest that the document is a forgery. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said: Give me tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until I bring witnesses and disqualify the document, we give him </span>time before forcing him to pay. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he has come </span>with witnesses within the time allotted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has come, </span>and the court reviews the case accordingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he does not com</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> within the time allotted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">we give him </span>an additional three days on which to bring witnesses, when the court is in session: <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday, Thursday, and Monday.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">has not come, we write a document of ostracis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against him </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">ninety days. </span>During <span class="gemarra-regular">the first thirty </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not descend to his property </span>to collect his debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">he is occupied </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowing money </span>to pay his debt. During <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle </span>period of thirty days <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, we do not descend to his property, as </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Perhaps he did not find </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to borrow </span>from and <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">occupied with selling </span>his property in order to pay his debt. During the <span class="gemarra-regular">final </span>thirty days <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, we do not descend to his property, as </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Perhaps the debtor has found a purchaser and <span class="gemarra-regular">the purchaser himself is occupied with </span>obtaining the <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>so that he can pay the debtor for the sale, and the debtor will then pay his debt.
If the debtor still <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come </span>to pay his debt after ninety days, <span class="gemarra-regular">we write </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">adrakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> allowing the creditor to collect his due from any <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>belonging to the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am comin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to pay and then he does not actually make an appearance. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I am not coming, we immediately write </span>a document of authorization without waiting for ninety days to pass.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">this matter </span>of a ninety-day waiting period applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a loan, </span>as the debtor requires time in order to obtain the money to pay it back. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a deposit </span>that the owner demands back from a bailee, <span class="gemarra-regular">we write </span>a document of authorization <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately. </span>Since a bailee should have immediate access to the deposit, there is no reason to grant him an extension.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we write </span>a document of authorization, the document applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">land, but </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to movable property, </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>draft such a document. The reason for this is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps the creditor will seize and consume </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and when the borrower </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and brings witnesses and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates the </span>creditor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">document, he will not find anything to collect </span>in order to retrieve his money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if the creditor </span>owns <span class="gemarra-regular">land, we write </span>a document authorizing the creditor to collect from any property that belongs to the borrower, including movable property. Since the creditor owns land, there is no concern that if the borrower manages to overturn the ruling he will have nothing from which to collect. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not draft </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization with regard to movable propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if </span>the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">has land. </span>This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned lest </span>the creditor’s land <span class="gemarra-regular">depreciate </span>in value and the borrower will be unable to retrieve his money.
The Gemara teaches another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we write </span>the document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization, we inform </span>the party that is liable to pay, as a final warning before authorizing a creditor to locate and take possession of his property in repayment of the debt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is nearby, but </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">distant, </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>notify him before authorizing the creditor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he is distant but there are relatives </span>of his nearby, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there are caravans that go </span>to the borrower’s current location <span class="gemarra-regular">and return, we delay </span>issuing <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>document of authorization for the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the year, until the caravan goes and returns, </span>so that if he wishes to make a claim, he can do so. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">where Ravina delayed </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the year </span>before issuing a document of authorization <span class="gemarra-regular">for Mar Aḥa, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until a caravan went </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">and returned from Bei Ḥozai.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. There, </span>Ravina delayed issuing the document because the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">was a violent man, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a document of <span class="gemarra-regular">authorization would come into his possession, it would not be possible to take it from him </span>if the borrower would prove that the original document was invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>i.e., in general, <span class="gemarra-regular">we wait for </span>the defendant to be informed <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if he is close enough to be informed within a day. Consequently, if the court decided the issue on Monday, <span class="gemarra-regular">a messenger </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>inform the defendant <span class="gemarra-regular">on Tuesday, and he </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>from his location to the court <span class="gemarra-regular">on Wednesday and stand trial on Thursday. </span>If a debtor is more than a day’s travel away, however, the court does not trouble itself to notify him.
§ Apropos the Gemara’s discussion of summoning an individual to court by means of a messenger, the Gemara discusses this issue in a more general manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: We deem the agent of the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who was sent to summon an individual to court, as <span class="gemarra-regular">credible as two </span>witnesses if he says that the defendant refuses to come to court. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this matter </span>applies only with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to excommunication, but </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>issuing <span class="gemarra-regular">a document of ostracism, since it causes </span>the defendant <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of money, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as he must give money to the scrib</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for drafting the document, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the agent is not deemed credible.
Additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: We may give </span>a defendant a particular <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>to appear in court by informing him of the trial <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>word of <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth from a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or from his neighbors, </span>as these people are trusted to notify the defendant of the court’s summons. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the defendant is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in the city. </span>

Daf 113a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the defendant <span class="gemarra-regular">is in the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>ostracize him for failing to respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we say: </span>Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not tell him </span>of the court’s summons, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they said </span>to themselves: Since the defendant is in the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">a court agent </span>has already <span class="gemarra-regular">found him and told him. </span>As a result, these unofficial messengers will not deliver the court’s summons to the defendant at all.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not pass by the court’s entrance </span>on his way home, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he does <span class="gemarra-regular">pass by the court’s entrance, </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>ostracize him. This is because it is possible that the unofficial messengers will <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to themselves: Since he passes by the courthouse, <span class="gemarra-regular">the court </span>has already <span class="gemarra-regular">found him and told him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he comes </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>that the woman or neighbor is sent to deliver the court summons. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he does <span class="gemarra-regular">not come </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>ostracized, because it is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they forgot </span>to notify him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who had <span class="gemarra-regular">a document of ostracism written about hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not come to court, we do not tear up the document for him until he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to court, </span>and it is not enough for him to simply commit to appearing. Similarly, if the document of ostracism was written <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not obey </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the court, we do not tear it up for him until he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">obeys </span>the ruling. The Gemara comments: This second statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he </span>has acquiesced and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will obey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">tear up the document for him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">sets a date </span>for an individual to appear in court on the upcoming <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>if he does not appear, they set a date for that <span class="gemarra-regular">Thursday, and </span>if he does not appear, they set a date for the following <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday, </span>so that he has a second <span class="gemarra-regular">date and </span>then a third <span class="gemarra-regular">date after </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">date. And </span>if he does not appear in court by the third date, then <span class="gemarra-regular">on the next day we write </span>a document of ostracism.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi happened </span>to come to <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of Rav Kahana. He saw </span>that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman whom </span>Rav Kahana had <span class="gemarra-regular">summoned to </span>appear in <span class="gemarra-regular">court in the evening, </span>but she did not appear, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in the morning </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote a document of ostracism concerning her. </span>Rav Asi said <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rav Ḥisda says, </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">sets a date </span>for the coming <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Thursday, and </span>then the following <span class="gemarra-regular">Monday </span>before it issues a document of ostracism?
Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: That matter </span>applies only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a man, as he is a victim of circumstance and is not </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">in the city </span>due to his vocational activities. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since she is </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">in the city, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">she does not come </span>to court the first time <span class="gemarra-regular">she is </span>immediately considered <span class="gemarra-regular">rebellious, </span>and the court may issue a document of ostracism right away.
Continuing the discussion of court dates, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: </span>The court <span class="gemarra-regular">does not set a date for </span>legal proceedings <span class="gemarra-regular">during the days of Nisan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor during the days of Tishrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and also <span class="gemarra-regular">not on the eve of a Festival nor the eve of Shabbat </span>because these are busy times. <span class="gemarra-regular">But during Nisan we may set </span>a court date to take place <span class="gemarra-regular">after Nisan, and </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">during Tishrei </span>we may set a court date to take place <span class="gemarra-regular">after Tishrei. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of Shabbat we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>set a court date to take place <span class="gemarra-regular">after the eve of Shabbat. What is the reason </span>for this? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">one is preoccupied with his work </span>in preparation <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat </span>and it is possible that he will forget about the court summons.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman says: We do not set </span>a court <span class="gemarra-regular">date for participants in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar, <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the months of the <span class="gemarra-italic">kalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor for participants in </span>the public discourses prior to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival during the </span>period leading up to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">would come before Rav Naḥman </span>during the <span class="it-text">kalla</span> period in order to make legal claims against others, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say to them: Did I gather you </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">for your </span>own needs? No, I gathered you to participate in Torah study. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But now that there are scoundrels, </span>who do not come to study Torah but rather to avoid trial, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned </span>that they will continue to evade prosecution, and therefore we summon them to court even during these time periods.
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to one who left a stolen item to his children, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">was something that may serve </span>as a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee </span>of a loan, the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to pay </span>the owner. The Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>this mishna to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, his son, </span>and explain that it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>refer only to <span class="gemarra-regular">something that can actually </span>serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">a guarantee </span>for a loan, i.e., land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it refers <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he plows with, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he drives </span>by directing it from <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, </span>which the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to return because of the honor of their father, </span>so that people will not continually point out that the inheritance was stolen and thereby disgrace their deceased parent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raises a dilemma before Rav: </span>If the robber left his heirs a stolen item that is used in relative privacy, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">a bed that he lies on </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a table upon which he eats,</span> rather than something as conspicuous as a large animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Are the heirs obligated to return it to its owner? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser” </span>(Proverbs 9:9), meaning that from the fact that the heirs must return a cow and a donkey, one can infer that they must also return a bed and a table.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exchang</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> larger coins for smaller ones <span class="gemarra-regular">from the trunk of customs collectors nor from the purse of tax </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collectors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may not take charity from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are assumed to have obtained their funds illegally. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may take </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the collector’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house or from </span>money he has with him in <span class="gemarra-regular">the market </span>that he did not take from his collection trunk or purse.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the prohibition against exchanging money from the trunk of a customs collector: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may give </span>the customs collector <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> as payment for a debt that amounts to less than a dinar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when the collector <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him change, </span>he may accept it.
It was taught in the mishna that one may not exchange money from the trunks of <span class="gemarra-regular">customs collectors, </span>which are assumed to include stolen funds. The Gemara questions this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t Shmuel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law of the kingdom is the law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., <span class="it-text">halakha</span> requires Jews to obey the laws of the state in which they live. Accordingly, the customs are collected legally and it should be permitted to make use of the funds.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The mishna is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">a customs collector who does not have a limitatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> placed by the governor on the amount he may collect, and he collects as he pleases. Alternatively, the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yannai said: </span>The mishna is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">a customs collector who stands on his own, </span>i.e., he was not appointed by the government but, on his own, he forces people to give him money.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who teach </span>the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>following mishna (<span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> 9:2) and its attendant discussion. The customs collectors would not levy a duty for the garments one was wearing. In light of this, the mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not wear </span>a garment made of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a combination of wool and linen, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he wears it <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of ten garments, </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to avoid </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">customs. </span>It was noted that this <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is prohibited to avoid </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">customs </span>by wearing a garment of diverse kinds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: It is permitted to avoid </span>paying <span class="gemarra-regular">customs </span>in this manner.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, with regard to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, they disagree about this: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act is permitted. </span>In this case, the prohibition is to benefit from wearing the garment, and that is not his intent, as his intention is merely to avoid paying the customs duties. Therefore, it is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act is prohibited. But is </span>it ever <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to avoid customs? Doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law?</span>
In answer to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a customs collector who does not have a limitation </span>placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yannai said: </span>The dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own, </span>i.e., who is self-appointed.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who teach </span>the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 27b): One <span class="gemarra-regular">may vow before murderers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plunderers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and customs collectors </span>in order to reinforce the claim <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a certain item that is being commandeered <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or that <span class="gemarra-regular">it belongs to the king’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and thereby avoid its seizure, <span class="gemarra-regular">despite </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">that it does not belong to the king’s house. </span>It was asked: Can it be that it is permitted to pronounce such a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before customs collectors? But doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law? </span>It should therefore be prohibited to state such a vow before the customs collectors.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>The mishna in <span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> issues its ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a customs collector who does not have a limitation </span>placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yannai say: </span>The mishna issues its ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The mishna issues its ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a gentile customs collector, </span>whom one may deceive, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew and a gentile who approach </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">for judgmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in a legal dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you can vindicate </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">under Jewish law, vindicate him, and say to </span>the gentile: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is our law. </span>If he can be vindicated <span class="gemarra-regular">under gentile law, vindicate him, and say to </span>the gentile: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your law. And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>possible to vindicate him under either system of law, <span class="gemarra-regular">one approaches </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">circuitously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> seeking a justification to vindicate the Jew. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One does not approach </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">circuitously </span>in order to vindicate the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the sanctification of God’s name, </span>as God’s name will be desecrated if the Jewish judge employs dishonest means.
The Gemara infers from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, the reason </span>that the court does not employ trickery in order to vindicate the Jew is only <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is </span>the consideration of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sanctification of God’s name. Consequently, </span>if there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>consideration of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sanctification of God’s name, </span>the court does <span class="gemarra-regular">approach </span>the case circuitously. Apparently, it is permitted to deceive a gentile.
The Gemara challenges this assertion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is robbery </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted? Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva taught this matter when he came from Zephirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where </span>is it derived that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">rob a gentile? </span>It is from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to a Jew who has been sold as a slave to a gentile: <span class="gemarra-regular">“After he is sold he may be redeemed” </span>(Leviticus 25:48), 

Daf 113b

indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>a Hebrew slave by force <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby allow him to <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>the gentile’s jurisdiction. Rather, the Jew must be freed by legal means. <span class="gemarra-regular">One might have thought </span>that it is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">deceive him </span>in order to free the Jew. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall reckon with him that bought him” </span>(Leviticus 25:50), in order to teach that one must <span class="gemarra-regular">be precise </span>in the financial dealings <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">purchaser </span>of a Hebrew slave, and one must pay him the appropriate sum without employing any form of deception. This indicates that it is prohibited to steal from a gentile.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling that permits the court to deceive a gentile is issued <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a regular <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse, which teaches that it is prohibited to deceive a gentile, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the seven Noahide mitzvot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ger</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">toshav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: How is it possible to differentiate between a gentile and a <span class="it-text">ger</span> <span class="it-text">toshav</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Aren’t both of them written next to each other, </span>indicating that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertains to both? As it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One who violates the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year will be punished by having to resort to selling himself as a slave. And he will sell himself <span class="gemarra-regular">not to you, but to a stranger, as it is stated: </span>“And sell himself unto <span class="gemarra-regular">the stranger” </span>(Leviticus 25:47), <span class="gemarra-regular">and not to a stranger </span>who is a convert, <span class="gemarra-regular">but to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ger</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">toshav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated: </span>“And sell himself unto <span class="gemarra-regular">the stranger who is a settler </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ger</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">toshav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>with you” (Leviticus 25:47).
The verse continues and states: “Or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family.” When it says <span class="gemarra-regular">“a stranger’s family,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the gentile </span>family members of a <span class="it-text">ger</span> <span class="it-text">toshav</span>, who are idolaters. <span class="gemarra-regular">When it says “or to the offshoot,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">who is sold to idol worship, </span>i.e., to work in a temple dedicated to idolatry. Since it is subsequently stated: “He shall reckon with him that bought him” (Leviticus 25:50), it is apparent that this reckoning applies equally to each of the above, including the gentile. This contradicts Rav Yosef’s answer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the slave, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an actual act of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery </span>committed against a gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">but there, </span>in the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where it would be permitted to employ deception if not for the desecration of God’s name, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to abrogating his loan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Abrogating a loan owed to a gentile is permitted because it does not entail actually taking money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rava: The release of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Hebrew slave </span>from his gentile master <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>akin to the <span class="gemarra-regular">abrogation of his loan.</span> The purchase price paid by the master is considered as a loan that the slave pays back over the years of his servitude until he goes free at the Jubilee. Consequently, deceptively bringing about his early release is akin to abrogating a loan, yet Rabbi Akiva derives from the verse that it is prohibited to do so. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava says: The body of a Hebrew slave is owne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by his master, and retaking him from the gentile by deceptive means would therefore constitute actual robbery.
The Gemara cites another statement related to stealing from a gentile. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Giddel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">rob a gentile, </span>but it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to retain <span class="gemarra-regular">his lost item</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one is not required to return it to him. The Gemara examines the basis for each of these rulings: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">rob a gentile, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">rob a gentile? </span>It is derived from a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that the Lord your God shall deliver unto you” </span>(Deuteronomy 7:16), indicating that it is permitted to consume the other nations’ property only <span class="gemarra-regular">when they are delivered into your hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in times of war, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not when they are not delivered into your hand.</span>
It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to retain <span class="gemarra-regular">his lost item, as Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: From where </span>is it derived that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to retain <span class="gemarra-regular">the lost item of a gentile? </span>It is derived from a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>with regard to the mitzva of returning a lost item: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With every lost thing of your brother’s” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:3), indicating that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">to your brother </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you return </span>a lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you do not return </span>a lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile.</span>
The Gemara questions this derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">has not yet come into </span>the Jew’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hand, as he is not obligated to pursue it </span>in an effort to find the lost item and return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the item had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">come into his hand, say </span>that he must <span class="gemarra-regular">return it </span>to the gentile. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is understood from the verse itself, as it states: “And so shall you do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you have found” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:3), which <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span>that the verse refers even to an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>has already <span class="gemarra-regular">come into one’s hand. </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: In a case where there is </span>a concern that retention of an article lost by a gentile will result in the <span class="gemarra-regular">desecration of </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited even </span>to retain a gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lost item.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to financially benefit from a business <span class="gemarra-regular">error </span>of a gentile, i.e., it need not be returned. The Gemara notes that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">where Shmuel purchased a golden bowl [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lakna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from a gentile in exchange [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bemar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span> the price <span class="gemarra-regular">of an iron </span>bowl, which was <span class="gemarra-regular">four dinars, and </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">included one </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">dina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the payment so that the gentile would not realize his mistake.
The Gemara relates another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana purchased one hundred and twenty barrels from a gentile for </span>the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span>barrels, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he included one </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar </span>in the payment. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Take note that I am relying upon yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> to check that the transaction has been carried out properly. The Gemara records a third episode: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina and a gentile purchased a palm tree </span>together in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to chop it up </span>and split the wood between them. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to his attendant: Hurry and precede </span>the gentile so that you can bring my share of the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from the trunk</span> of the tree, which is thicker than the upper part of the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the gentile knows </span>only the <span class="gemarra-regular">number </span>of logs that he is due to receive and will not realize that you are taking thicker pieces.
The Gemara relates a final anecdote: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi was traveling on the road </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he saw a branch of a grapevin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in an orchard,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">clusters of grapes hanging on it. He said to his attendant: Go see </span>to whom these clusters belong. <span class="gemarra-regular">If they are </span>owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, bring </span>some to me, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are </span>owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, do not bring me </span>any. <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain gentile who was sitting in the orchard overheard </span>Rav Ashi’s instructions. The gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to steal the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A gentile takes money </span>for his grapes, and I intended to pay for them, but <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew does not take money </span>for his grapes and I did not want to take them without paying for them.
§ The Gemara relates to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter of civil law <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Shmuel says: The law of the kingdom is the law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the halakhic principle is that Jews must obey the laws of the state in which they reside. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Know </span>that this principle is true from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the municipal authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">cut down palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> without the consent of their owners <span class="gemarra-regular">and construct bridges </span>from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we cross over them. </span>Evidently, the wood is not considered stolen property, which one is prohibited from using, because the law of the kingdom is the law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the reason the bridges may be used is <span class="gemarra-regular">because their owners despaired of retrieving them </span>and not because the law of the kingdom is the law. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">If not </span>for the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law of the kingdom is the law, how </span>would the <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of the owners of the trees allow us to use the bridges? The fact that the owners have despaired of retrieving their wood does not effect a transfer of property, and it therefore still belongs to them.
The Gemara questions Rava’s understanding: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the municipal authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">do not act as the king said. The king said: Go and cut </span>down a bit of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from all the valleys</span> in the area so that each individual loses only a small amount of wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">They, </span>however, disobey the king and <span class="gemarra-regular">go and cut </span>down all the wood needed for the bridge <span class="gemarra-regular">from one valley. </span>Therefore, even if the law of the kingdom is the law, this cannot be the reason that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> permits Jews to cross over such bridges, as the authorities are not enforcing the law of the kingdom, but rather their own unlawful inclinations.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">An agent of a king </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the king </span>himself, and he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>expected to <span class="gemarra-regular">trouble </span>himself to collect wood proportionally from each valley. <span class="gemarra-regular">They, </span>the owners of the land where the wood is cut, <span class="gemarra-regular">cause themselves a loss, as they should collect </span>compensation <span class="gemarra-regular">from all </span>the other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of the valleys </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and take money </span>from them for this purpose. Since the land owners whose wood was used have permission to collect compensation from all the residents in the area, the authorities are acting within their rights by confiscating wood from a single location.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>When the king’s agents come to collect the king’s share of the grain from a field owned by several partners, the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is found in the granar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> must <span class="gemarra-regular">pay the king’s share </span>for the entire property, as the agents are not expected to locate and exact payment from each individual proprietor separately. The partner who paid may later claim reimbursement from the other owners for covering their share of the tax. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this statement </span>applies only to <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span>who share ownership of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">But a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sharecropper collects his portion </span>from the crop but does not own a share of the land. Consequently, the tax may not be collected from his produce, and doing so would constitute robbery.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Property that belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">a town dweller may be taken as security for </span>the tax owed by another <span class="gemarra-regular">town dweller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And this statement applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the property tax and head tax of that year, but </span>with regard to taxes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous year, since the king has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been appeased, </span>the ability to take property belonging to someone else has <span class="gemarra-regular">passed. </span>The tax collector has already paid the entire amount he must pay the king for the previous year, and everything else he collects is his own profit. Although he has the right to collect this extra amount, he may not take property for one person as security for the taxes of someone else.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">who construct pen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for their animals <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>and charge a fee to bring their animals through the fields around the city to fertilize the fields, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to purchase </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. What is the reason? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the livestock of the </span>Jewish residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">town become intermingled with their </span>livestock, and it is possible that the animal one would buy is actually stolen property.
Rava adds: If the pens were <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to purchase </span>livestock <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, </span>as it is unlikely that a Jew’s livestock became intermingled with the seller’s livestock. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: If the owners </span>of the livestock <span class="gemarra-regular">were pursuing </span>the animals, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the pens were <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, it is prohibited </span>to purchase livestock from the owners of the pens.
§ Apropos the discussion of legal dealings between Jews and gentiles, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava declared, and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>who declared: All <span class="gemarra-regular">who ascend upward </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>all who <span class="gemarra-regular">descend downward </span>to Babylonia agree that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew who knows </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">evidenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concerning </span>the legal claim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, and </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">did not demand from him </span>that he testify, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the Jew nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">went and testified for him in a gentile court, against his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason </span>that we excommunicate him? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they, </span>the gentile courts, <span class="gemarra-regular">expropriate money</span>

Daf 114a

based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the word of one </span>witness, which is insufficient evidence according to Jewish law. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>that this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> individual testifies alone against his fellow Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">but when two </span>witnesses testify against a Jew, we do <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> excommunicate them, as their testimony is sufficient evidence according to Jewish law as well, and they have not caused the defendant any unjustified financial loss even according to <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>witness <span class="gemarra-regular">also, we said </span>that we excommunicate him <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if he testified <span class="gemarra-regular">in a court of villagers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demagista</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>if he testified in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>official government <span class="gemarra-regular">courthouse [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">davar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is not excommunicated. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">they also prescribe an oath to </span>the defendant based on the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>witness, but they do not expropriate money, in accordance with Jewish law.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: When I was in the academy of Rav Huna, </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before us: </span>What is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an <span class="gemarra-regular">important person, </span>whose testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">is relied upon </span>by the gentile courts <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>if it were the testimony of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses? Since the gentile court will <span class="gemarra-regular">expropriate money </span>based <span class="gemarra-regular">on his word, </span>should the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> be that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not testify? Or perhaps, since he is an important person, he cannot escape </span>the authorities who demand his testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">testify. </span>The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ The Gemara cites another situation where a Jew is excommunicated for causing harm to another Jew. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish man who sells a gentile </span>a plot of <span class="gemarra-regular">land </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the border of </span>the property of <span class="gemarra-regular">his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason? If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he has ignored <span class="gemarra-regular">the right of one </span>whose field <span class="gemarra-regular">borders </span>the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">but doesn’t the Master say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who purchases </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">from a gentile, and one who sells </span>land <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no right of one </span>whose field <span class="gemarra-regular">borders </span>the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we say to him </span>on behalf of the owner of the adjacent field: <span class="gemarra-regular">You have placed a lion, </span>i.e., a dangerous individual, <span class="gemarra-regular">on my border, </span>as the gentile might now cause me harm. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">we excommunicate hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until he accepts upon himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">all harm that comes </span>upon the neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the gentile’s activities.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">customs collectors took one’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave him a different donkey </span>that was taken from another Jew in its stead, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits took his garment and gave him a different garment </span>that was taken from a Jew in its stead, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">his because the owners despaired of </span>retrieving <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>when they were stolen, and they may therefore be acquired by another. In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who salvages </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">river</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or from a troop [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hagayis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of soldiers, <span class="gemarra-regular">or from bandits, if the owners </span>of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are his, </span>i.e., they belong to the one who salvaged them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">swar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of bees, if </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving the bees, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are his, </span>i.e., they belong to the one who found them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka said: A woman or a minor, </span>whose testimony is not generally accepted by the court, <span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed credible to say: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">from here that this swarm emerged</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it therefore belongs to a certain individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may walk into another’s fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to salvage his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">swarm </span>of bees that has relocated there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he damaged </span>some property in the process, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must pay </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what he has damaged. But </span>if the bees settled on a branch of a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not cut </span>off the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">branch </span>in order to take the bees, even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that he will later <span class="gemarra-regular">give him the money </span>for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: He may even cut </span>off the branch <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">the money </span>for it as compensation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who is given an item by a customs collector or a bandit may keep the item. It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he took </span>a donkey from the customs collector, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the original owners. </span>The Gemara explains: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">despair alone does not effect </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition. </span>Consequently, the customs collector did not acquire the donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it initially came into the possession </span>of the individual to whom the customs collector gave it <span class="gemarra-regular">illegally, </span>and he is therefore required to return it to the original owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he </span>wants to act beyond the letter of the law and <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to return it </span>voluntarily, he should <span class="gemarra-regular">return it to the original owners, </span>but he is not required to return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he is not required to return it? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">despair alone effects </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>and the donkey was, therefore, acquired by the Jew when the customs collector gave it to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nevertheless, if he said: I do not want </span>to accept <span class="gemarra-regular">money that is not mine, he returns </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the original owners.</span>
§ The mishna teaches that if customs collectors or bandits replaced one’s item with one taken from another Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">his because the owners </span>despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. In this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: They taught </span>that the owners certainly despaired of recovering their property <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when it was stolen by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile bandit, but </span>if it was taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish bandit, no, </span>the owner did not necessarily despair of recovering it. This is because the victim of the theft might <span class="gemarra-regular">reason: Tomorrow, I will take him to court </span>and force him to return what he stole.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable: </span>When dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles, who judge </span>a case and impose their verdicts <span class="gemarra-regular">with force, he does not despair </span>because he realizes that the gentile court will enforce the law. By contrast, when dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, since </span>Jewish courts merely <span class="gemarra-regular">pronounce a verbal </span>decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs</span> of recovering his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>Rav Ashi’s distinction <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was stated with regard to the latter clause </span>of the mishna, which states: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who salvages </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from gentiles or from bandits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the owners despaired of retrieving it, the one who finds it may keep it. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is known that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owners despaired </span>of retreating it, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the finder may keep the item; but in <span class="gemarra-regular">an unspecified </span>situation, where it is not known whether the owners despaired, the finder may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>keep the item.
Concerning this, Rav Ashi said: <span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when the item was stolen by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>bandit, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the gentile court <span class="gemarra-regular">judges </span>a case and imposes its verdict <span class="gemarra-regular">with force, </span>and therefore it cannot be assumed that the owners despair. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the robbery was committed by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish bandit, since </span>Jewish courts merely <span class="gemarra-regular">pronounce a verbal </span>decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">despairs </span>of recovering his property.
§ Apropos the discussion with regard to an owner’s despair of retrieving a lost or stolen item, the Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Kelim</span> 26:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hides </span>that are tanned by the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity. </span>Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to hides <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to a leatherworker, thought does not render them susceptible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual impurity. </span>Since this individual sells leather to others, when he uses a piece of leather for a household purpose and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is not considered a finished state, as he is likely to change his mind and sell the leather to one who will process it further and put it to a different use.
The mishna continues: If the hides are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a thief, </span>who has stolen them from another, the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>If they are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a robber, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, </span>because he is not considered the owner of the hide. The difference is that unlike the case of a thief, who steals items stealthily, the identity of a robber, who takes the item openly, is known to the owner, and he harbors hope of finding him and getting the item back. Consequently, he does not despair of recovering his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the matters are reversed: </span>In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a robber, </span>the robber’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. </span>If the hides are those <span class="gemarra-regular">of a thief, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, because the owners have not despaired </span>of recovering them and the thief has not acquired the hide. Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is that a robber, who seizes items brazenly, is a more difficult criminal to apprehend and bring to justice than a thief.
The Gemara analyzes the scope of the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla says: The dispute </span>is only with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to an unspecified </span>case, where it is unknown whether or not the owners despaired, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where it is known </span>that the owners despaired, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that their <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>effects legal <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: </span>Even in cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is known </span>that the owners despaired, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">also a dispute, </span>because although the owner may have expressed despair verbally, he may still hope to retrieve the item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rabba: Do not disagree with Ulla, as </span>the formulation of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned in the mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his </span>opinion. The mishna states that according to Rabbi Shimon, thought does not render the hides of a thief susceptible to ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because the owners did not despair </span>of retrieving them, and therefore the hides do not belong to the thief. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the thought of the thief does not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">is that the owners did not despair </span>of retrieving them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the owners </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of retrieving them, then <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items would be <span class="gemarra-regular">his, </span>and his thoughts would render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity.
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We learned </span>the mishna as saying: A thief cannot render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is no </span>true <span class="gemarra-regular">despair for owners </span>of stolen goods, even if they state they have despaired.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna here that if <span class="gemarra-regular">customs collectors took one’s donkey </span>and replaced it with a donkey taken from another Jew, or if bandits took his garment and replaced it with a garment taken from another Jew, he may keep these items because the owners despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in this mishna?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that the owner despairs only in the case of a thief who steals secretly, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, </span>because the mishna indicates that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of a customs collector. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the owner despairs only in the case of a robber, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, </span>because the mishna indicates that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thief </span>also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of bandits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Ulla, who says </span>that all agree that if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known </span>that the owners despaired, the individual in possession of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too </span>it is possible to explain that the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is known </span>that the owners despaired, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all agree </span>that the recipient of the stolen property may keep it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rabba, who says </span>that even in cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is known </span>that the owners despaired, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">also a dispute, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna written? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and it is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>The Gemara answers that the mishna is discussing a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who is similar to a robber in that he steals using force and aggression. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the victim of a robber despairs of recovering his property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>identical to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, </span>i.e., the customs collector, and there is no reason for the mishna to teach the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> twice. The Gemara answers that the mishna in fact teaches the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers, </span>the customs collector and the armed bandit.
The Gemara suggests another proof with regard to the dispute between Ulla and Rabba. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, a robber, and one who forces </span>another to sell him some-thing, <span class="gemarra-regular">their consecrated items are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, and their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and their tithes are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> assumes that even the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber</span> despairs of retrieving his property, as seen from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the robber’s act of consecration or separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> or tithes is valid. This contradicts the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that the thoughts of a robber do not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity, because he is not considered the owner of the hides. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> assumes that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>despairs of retrieving his property, as seen from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the robber’s act of consecration or separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> or tithes is valid. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, as he holds that the thoughts of a thief do not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity, because he is not considered the owner of the hides.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Ulla, who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known </span>that the owners despaired of recovering their property, the individual in possession of the items <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>it is possible to explain that the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is known </span>that the owners despaired. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rabba, who says </span>that even in cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is known </span>that the owners despaired, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">also a dispute, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> written? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>written in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mentions a thief it is actually referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit, </span>who is considered a robber because he steals using force and aggression. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the victim of a robber despairs of recovering his property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>identical to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, </span>and there is no reason for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to teach the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> twice. The Gemara answers that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> wishes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers.</span>
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to an actual thief, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>written in accordance the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A thief </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a robber. </span>

Daf 114b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And we maintain, </span>as the Gemara concludes below, that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi means that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the owner despairs of recovering his item once it is stolen by a robber.
§ The Gemara examines <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber. A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>who hold that the owners do not despair of recovering their item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a thief therefore does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the items he steals? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he was saying </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the owners despair of recovering their property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a thief therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the stolen items.
The Gemara attempts to resolve the dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">customs collectors took </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey </span>and gave him a different donkey that was taken from another Jew in its stead, or if bandits took his garment and gave him a different garment that was taken from a Jew in its stead, these items are now his because the owners despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. It is therefore apparent that despair is assumed both in the case of a robber, i.e., the customs collector, and in the case of a thief, i.e., the bandits.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who assume that the owners despair only in the case of a thief, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the mishna assumes that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>also despairs of retrieving his property. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who assumes that the owners despair only in the case of a robber, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the mishna assumes that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>also despairs of retrieving his property.
The Gemara presents the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the owners despair of recovering their property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a thief therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the stolen items, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the stolen goods.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying</span> that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, and </span>a thief therefore does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the stolen goods, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? Since the mishna rules that the owners have presumably despaired with regard to both a thief and a robber, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, and it is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with an armed bandit, </span>who is considered a robber because he steals using force and aggression, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that despair is assumed in the case of a robber. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>identical to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, </span>i.e., the mishna’s first case of the customs collector, and there is no reason for the mishna to teach the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> twice. The Gemara answers: The mishna wishes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof based upon the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief, a robber, and one who forces </span>another to sell him something, <span class="gemarra-regular">their consecrated items are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, and their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and their tithes are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> assumes that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>also despairs of retrieving his property, and therefore the robber’s act of consecration or separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> or tithes is valid. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult </span>because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> assumes that the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thief </span>despairs of retrieving his property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the owner despairs of recovering his property, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that a thief therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the stolen items. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> written?
The Gemara responds: When the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to a thief, it is actually referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an armed bandit, </span>who is legally considered a robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that victims of a robber despair of recovering their property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>identical to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>that is mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> wishes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">robbers.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to Rabba: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s own interpretation of the mishna (111b) that states that children who inherit an item that was stolen by their father are obligated to return it to the owner if it is something that serves as a legal guarantee of a loan, e.g., land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">would teach Rabbi Shimon, his son, </span>that the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring only to <span class="gemarra-regular">something that may actually serve </span>as a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">guarantee, </span>i.e., land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he plows with, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he drives </span>by directing it from <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, </span>which the heirs <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated to return because of the honor of their father.</span>
The Gemara infers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that the heirs must return the stolen item is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the honor of their father. But </span>if it were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of their father, </span>they would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be required to return it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">was saying </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon. </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a swarm of bees, </span>if the owners despaired of retrieving the bees, they belong to the one who found them. The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason that the mishna includes the case of the bees, which begins with the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is saying: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated by the mishna applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a swarm of bees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is </span>the property of the owners via <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic </span>form of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the fact that one cannot effect a legal acquisition of bees by Torah law. It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">since one acquires </span>the swarm of bees <span class="gemarra-regular">only by rabbinic law, even </span>where the owners’ response is <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified </span>it can be assumed that they <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>of recovering the bees, and the finder may keep them. To counter this, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is known that <span class="gemarra-regular">the owners </span>of the bees <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired</span> of recovering them, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the finder may keep the bees; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>despair, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not keep them.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka said: A woman or a mino</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is deemed credible </span>to say: It was from here that this swarm emerged, and it therefore belongs to a certain individual.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are a woman and a minor eligible for testimony? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that women and minors cannot present testimony in court, so how can Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka rule that they are deemed credible? The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Here, we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the owners were pursuing </span>the bees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the woman and the minor were speaking offhandedly and saying: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">from here that this swarm emerged. </span>In this context, it can be assumed that the individual identified as the owner is the real owner of the bees, even in the absence of formal testimony in court.
Having mentioned a case of offhand remarks, the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says: </span>Information gleaned from <span class="gemarra-regular">one who speaks offhandedly is valid only with regard to testimony </span>enabling <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>to remarry, as the Sages were lenient and decreed that the incidental remarks of certain individuals who are not eligible to serve as witnesses may be relied upon in such a case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And </span>is it so that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rely upon offhand remarks in other situations? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the case in the mishna of <span class="gemarra-regular">a swarm of bees is</span> a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks offhandedly, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that he is deemed credible. Rav Ashi answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">A swarm of bees is different, as it is </span>the property of its owners via <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic </span>form of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition. </span>Consequently, the Sages relied on offhand remarks.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>case where offhand remarks expressed by those who are ineligible to testify in court would be accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah law? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel says: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain person who was speaking offhandedly and saying: I remember when I was a child and I </span>would still <span class="gemarra-regular">ride on father’s shoulder. And they took me from schoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and removed my tunic, and immersed me </span>in a ritual bath so that I would be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that evening.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥanina </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude</span> his retelling of the incident <span class="gemarra-regular">as follows: </span>That individual then went on to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">And my friends </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">separate </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">from me, and they would call me: Yoḥanan, eater of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥallot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a reference to the portion of dough given to the priests, which has the same status as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>after hearing this anecdote, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">elevated him to the priesthoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and granted him the right to partake of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on his statement. </span>Since it is prohibited for non-priests to consume <span class="it-text">teruma</span> by Torah law, it is apparent that offhand remarks may be relied upon even with regard to Torah law, even in cases unrelated to enabling a woman to remarry.
Rav Ashi answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi granted him the right to partake of produce that is <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic law, </span>as he holds that the requirement to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> after the destruction of the Temple is by rabbinic law. One can still posit that offhand remarks made by individuals who are ineligible to testify in court are not deemed credible with regard to Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And still, </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>other case where offhand remarks made by those who are ineligible to testify in court would be accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law? But when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, didn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">he say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana of Carthage [Kartigna]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Carthage, related: An incident came before Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and some say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">incident came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a certain child who was speaking offhandedly and said: My mother and I were captured </span>and held <span class="gemarra-regular">among the gentiles. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">I would go out to draw water, my mind </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">on my mother, </span>and when I would go out <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gather wood, my mind </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">on my mother. </span>Since the child was always conscious of his mother, he was aware that she was not violated by her captors.
The Gemara concludes the statement of Rav Dimi and explains the challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">married her to a priest </span>based <span class="gemarra-regular">on his statement. </span>Since it is prohibited by Torah law for a priest to marry a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by Torah law and with whom she cannot establish a marital bond, e.g., a gentile, it is clear that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi relied on an offhand remark even with regard to a prohibition by Torah law.
The Gemara answers: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were lenient with regard to a captured woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> By Torah law, a woman taken captive may be presumed to remain permitted to a priest, and it is the Sages who decreed that she is forbidden due to the concern that she was raped. It is this rabbinic decree that may be disregarded on the basis of offhand remarks.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the bees settled on a branch of a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not cut </span>off the other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">branch </span>in order to take the bees, even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that he will later <span class="gemarra-regular">give him the money </span>for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: It is a stipulation of the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which takes effect even without being confirmed by individuals, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one will</span> be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter another’s field and cut off another’s branch </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to salvage his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">swarm </span>of bees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the owner of the field then <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the value of his branch from his fellow’s swarm.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court that </span>one who sees another’s honey barrel break <span class="gemarra-regular">should pour out his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and </span>then use the empty wine barrel to <span class="gemarra-regular">salvage the other’s honey, </span>which is more expensive than wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the owner of the wine then <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the value of his wine from the other’s honey. And it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a stipulation of the court that one </span>who sees that another’s donkey has fallen <span class="gemarra-regular">should unload his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">wood </span>from his own donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">and load the other’s flax, </span>which is more expensive than wood, in its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the owner of the wood then <span class="gemarra-regular">collects the value of his wood from the other’s flax. </span>These stipulations take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on this condition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua apportioned Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Jewish people.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who recognizes his </span>stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in another’s possession, and a rumor had spread in the city </span>that the former had been the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft, the purchaser, </span>i.e., the one in possession of these items, <span class="gemarra-regular">must take an oath to </span>the victim as to <span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">he spent </span>on the purchase, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>that sum of money in exchange for returning the items. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if no </span>such rumor had spread, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not in </span>the purported victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">power </span>to assert that the items were stolen, and he is not entitled to demand their return, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The items were never stolen; rather, the purported victim <span class="gemarra-regular">sold them to another, and this </span>individual who currently possesses the item <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased them from </span>that other person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if a rumor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spread in the city </span>that he had been the victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft, what of it? Let us suspect </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he sold the items and he himself is spreading the rumor </span>that they were stolen so that he will be able to buy them back.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where people, </span>i.e., guests, <span class="gemarra-regular">cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into his house, and he arose at night and shouted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehifgin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said: My vessels have been stolen, </span>in which case it seems clear that he was the victim of theft. The Gemara rejects this rationale: On the contrary, the suspicion that he is lying should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he has found a pretext </span>for claiming that his property was stolen, and it should be suspected that he is taking advantage of the situation dishonestly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> by stating <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a group of people spent the night in his house. And <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a tunnel </span>that had been <span class="gemarra-regular">burrowed into his house, and the people that stayed overnight </span>as guests <span class="gemarra-regular">in his house left with bundles of vessels on their shoulders, and everyone says: So-and-so’s vessels were stolen. </span>In such a case, there is clear evidence that the homeowner was the victim of theft.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels were </span>stolen but <span class="gemarra-regular">scrolls were not. </span>Why must the purchaser return the scrolls as well as the vessels? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>everyone <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">scrolls </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>stolen.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us suspect </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>scrolls were taken, while <span class="gemarra-regular">he is claiming </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>scrolls were stolen. If this is the case, he is claiming scrolls that do not belong to him. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case where people <span class="gemarra-regular">are saying: Such and such a scroll and such and such </span>a scroll were stolen, i.e., it is known which scrolls were taken from the homeowner.
The Gemara questions this as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the scrolls that were stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">were old </span>and had therefore depreciated in value, while <span class="gemarra-regular">he is claiming </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>scrolls were taken. If so, he is claiming scrolls that do not belong to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are so-and-so’s vessels </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">these are so-and-so’s scrolls. </span>In this case it is known exactly which items were stolen.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But doesn’t Rav </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a burglar </span>who came in <span class="gemarra-regular">and took vessels and left is exempt </span>from paying for those items? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this exemption? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he purchases them with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">blood. </span>Since a homeowner is allowed to kill a burglar, a burglar is exempt from returning the stolen items, based on the principle: One receives the greater punishment. Consequently, if the burglar himself is exempt, how can one who purchases an item from the burglar be required to return it?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter, that </span>one who steals <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>what he stole, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a burglar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as he initially subjected himself to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>when he broke into the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>thieves, who stayed overnight as guests of the homeowner, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>break into the house and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">subject themselves to </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">killed, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>exempt from returning the stolen item.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: We taught </span>that all of these conditions must be met before the purchaser can be forced to return the item <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner who is wont to sell his vessels, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner who is not wont to sell his vessels, </span>

Daf 115a

one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need to pursue </span>the matter in <span class="gemarra-regular">all this </span>detail.
The Gemara questions this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he needed money, and he </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">sold </span>the items despite the fact that he does not generally sell his personal belongings. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: A rumor spread in the city </span>that he had been a victim of <span class="gemarra-regular">theft. </span>It is reasonable to assume that he is the rightful owner, as he does not usually sell his belongings and it is common knowledge that he was the victim of theft.
§ Having assessed the mishna’s ruling with regard to a case where the thief remained unidentified, the Gemara discusses a case where the thief was found. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>In a case where a thief <span class="gemarra-regular">stole </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">and sold </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and later the thief was identified, Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: </span>The homeowner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>can be pursued only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>one, i.e., the thief, but he has no claim against the purchaser. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai: </span>The homeowner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>can also be pursued <span class="gemarra-regular">with the second </span>one, i.e., with the purchaser.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree. Here, </span>in the case about which Rabbi Yoḥanan issues his ruling, the item was purchased from the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the victim of the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired </span>of recovering the stolen item. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>can be pursued even <span class="gemarra-regular">with the second </span>one, i.e., the purchaser. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case about which Rav issues his ruling, the item was purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the victim <span class="gemarra-regular">despaired, </span>and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>can be pursued only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>one, i.e., the thief.
Rav Yosef continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And both </span>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan have accepted as <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the ruling of Rav Ḥisda </span>(111b), that if the owner had not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either the thief or the purchaser.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree? Isn’t </span>a case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>to which members <span class="gemarra-regular">of the priesthood </span>are entitled <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable </span>to a case of a stolen item that was sold <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the onset of the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">despair, </span>as the priest still hopes to receive the gifts, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with regard to their legal status? This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ḥullin</span> 132a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one said to </span>a butcher: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sell me the innards of a cow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the gifts of the priesthood were in them, </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">must give </span>the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not deduct </span>the value of the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>he agreed to pay the butcher. By contrast, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he purchased </span>the innards <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">by weight, he must give </span>the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may deduct </span>the value of the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>he agreed to pay the butcher.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav says: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">weighed </span>the innards <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the butcher weighed </span>the innards <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, the </span>priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">claim </span>may be pursued only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the butcher. </span>The butcher is comparable to a thief when he sells the gifts of the priesthood to a non-priest, and Rav holds that the priest can press his claim only against the butcher. Similarly, in the case of the mishna he would hold that the owner can press his claim only against the thief and not against the purchaser.
The Gemara refutes Abaye’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that Rav meant that the priest can <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>pursue his <span class="gemarra-regular">claim with the butcher, </span>although he is certainly able to claim the gifts from the purchaser. And Rav had to teach this <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts of the priesthood are not </span>considered to have been <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>even if the butcher sells them, because wherever they are they remain the legal property of the priests. Rav therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that they are considered to have been stolen in this case, and therefore the priest can press his claim against the butcher.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Abaye, who said </span>that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree, with regard to what </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda. </span>Rav disagrees with Rav Ḥisda and rules that one is entitled to collect only from the thief, while Rabbi Yoḥanan accepts the ruling of Rav Ḥisda and allows one to collect from either the thief or the purchaser.
The Gemara presents another explanation of the dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said </span>that both agree that if the owner has not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either party. They disagree in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the owners despaired </span>of retrieving it only after the item was already <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the purchaser, but they did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>when it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of the thief.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is with regard to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>on the part of the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a change in possession </span>of a stolen item, e.g., it leaves the possession of the thief and enters the possession of a purchaser, the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the item. By contrast, if there is first <span class="gemarra-regular">a change in possession </span>of a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">despair </span>on the part of the owner, then the purchaser does <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>the item. Since in this case the owner did not despair until after the change of possession from the thief to the purchaser, the purchaser did not legally acquire the item, and the owner can press his claim against him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that there <span class="gemarra-regular">is no differenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> whether the despair or change of possession came first. As long as the owner has despaired of recovering his item, it becomes the property of the purchaser, and the owner cannot demand that he return it.
The Gemara presents a third explanation of the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that it </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>by the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner. But here, it is with regard to </span>whether the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>can be pursued only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>one, i.e., the thief, meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law with regard to the purchaser </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>after returning the item to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can collect money </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the thief,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the claim </span>of the purchaser can be pursued <span class="gemarra-regular">with the second one, </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law with regard to the purchaser </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money from the owne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> when he returns the item to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case.
The Gemara questions this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rav hold </span>that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t Rav Huna a student of Rav, and </span>yet when a certain thief known as <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan the Wicke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stole a cloak and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it, </span>and the case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Huna, he said to that man </span>from whom the cloak was stolen: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go redeem your pledge </span>from the purchaser, i.e., reimburse the purchaser for the garment that he returned to you. Evidently, Rav’s own student held that the Sages did allow a purchaser to claim reimbursement from the owner.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan the Wicked is different. Since </span>he has no money, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>way for the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">to collect payment from him, </span>and the case is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable </span>to a case where the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">was not identified, </span>with regard to which case the Sages implemented the provision ensuring the integrity of the marketplace.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: If he is a well-known thief</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case. The purchaser should have been aware that the item may be stolen and should not have purchased it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t Ḥanan the Wicked well known, and </span>yet, according to Rav Huna, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">well known for villainy, </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not well known for theft.</span>
§ The Gemara continues to examine the provision ensuring the integrity of the marketplace. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his deb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with the stolen item, or one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his </span>debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">credit </span>that was extended to him with the stolen item, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they say </span>to the creditor: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was not with the expectation of </span>receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">that you gave </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">anything.</span>
With regard to the integrity of the marketplace, it was also stated that if a thief provided a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">worth two hundred </span>dinars as <span class="gemarra-regular">collatera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>a loan of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span>dinars, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case. Consequently, the creditor is entitled to reimbursement from the owner for returning the collateral. If the collateral and the loan were <span class="gemarra-regular">of equal value</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ameimar said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Mar Zutra that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case.
The Gemara examines other applications of this provision: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the stolen item was purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">for an amount equal </span>to its actual market value, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case. If a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one hundred </span>dinars was purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the price of <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did implement the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case.
The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">in all these </span>cases the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace, except </span>with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his debt </span>with the stolen item and one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his </span>debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">credit </span>that was extended to him with the stolen item.
The Gemara recounts a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi bar Nazi, the father-in-law of Ravina, was owed four dinars by a certain man, </span>who then <span class="gemarra-regular">stole a cloak and brought it to </span>Avimi as repayment for the loan. Avimi then <span class="gemarra-regular">lent him four additional dinars. In the end, the thief was identified </span>as the debtor, and the case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Ravina </span>to determine whether or not the owner would have to pay Avimi for returning the cloak.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to Avimi: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>four dinars that were lent, the thief is viewed as one who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his debt, and </span>the owner is <span class="gemarra-regular">not required to give anything </span>in exchange for the garment’s return as the Sages’ ordinance ensuring the integrity of the marketplace does not apply in such a case. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those four additional dinars, take your money </span>from the owner of the cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">and return the cloak </span>to him. Since Avimi lent the second set of dinars only because he had received the cloak, Ravina ruled that the Sages’ ordinance applied to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kohen objects to this: But perhaps the cloak was given </span>to Avimi only in payment <span class="gemarra-regular">for these first </span>four <span class="gemarra-regular">dinars, </span>and it was a case of a thief who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his debt </span>or who <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and repaid his </span>debt from <span class="gemarra-regular">credit </span>that was extended to him with the stolen item. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the latter four dinars </span>were loaned because Avimi <span class="gemarra-regular">trusted the debtor, just as he trusted him initially, </span>when he lent the first four dinars. The cloak was not collateral for the second loan, and therefore the Sages’ ordinance should not apply. <span class="gemarra-regular">The matter circulated </span>until <span class="gemarra-regular">it came before Rabbi Abbahu, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kohen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara recounts another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A resident of Naresh stole a scroll </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sold it to a resident of Pappunya for eighty dinars. The resident of Pappunya </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">went and sold it to a resident of Meḥoza for one hundred and twenty dinars. In the end, the thief was identified </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: The </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the scroll should go and give the resident of Meḥoza eighty dinars and take his scroll </span>in return. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>afterward, <span class="gemarra-regular">the resident of Meḥoza should go and take </span>the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">from the resident of Pappunya.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava objects to this: Now </span>that it has been established that with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">purchases from a thief, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">implemented the provision </span>ensuring <span class="gemarra-regular">the integrity of the marketplace in this </span>case despite the fact that he dealt with the thief directly, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to teach that the same would apply to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>a stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">from a purchaser? </span>Accordingly, the final purchaser is entitled to receive from the original owner the full amount that he paid for the item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the scroll should go and give the resident of Meḥoza one hundred and twenty dinars and take his scroll </span>in return. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the scroll should g</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and collect forty</span> dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">from the resident of Pappunya and eighty </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">from the resident of Naresh, </span>as each profited from the sale in these amounts, respectively.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a situation where <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">came with his barrel of wine, and that </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">came with his jug of honey, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel of honey cracked and this </span>first individual <span class="gemarra-regular">poured </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">his wine and salvaged the </span>other’s <span class="gemarra-regular">honey, </span>which is worth more than the wine, by collecting it <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>his wine barrel, 

Daf 115b

the owner of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">only his wage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., compensation for the effort he put into salvaging the honey. He is not, however, entitled to compensation for the wine itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the owner of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will salvag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your </span>honey <span class="gemarra-regular">and you will pay me the value of my </span>wine, the owner of the honey is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to pay him </span>compensation for the wine.
Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">a river washed away his donke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the donkey of another, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>donkey was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one hundred dinars and </span>the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">of the other </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth two hundred, and </span>the individual with the less valuable donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">abandoned his </span>donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">salvaged </span>the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">of the other, he has </span>the right to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">only his wage, </span>i.e., compensation for the effort he put into salvaging his fellow’s donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to </span>the owner of the more valuable donkey: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will salvage your </span>donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">and you will pay me the </span>monetary value <span class="gemarra-regular">of mine </span>in exchange, the owner of the more valuable donkey is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to pay </span>the rescuer compensation for his donkey.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>does one who pours out wine have the right to collect only this wage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him say to </span>the owner of the honey: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have acquired </span>your honey <span class="gemarra-regular">from ownerless </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who was laden </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of wine and jugs of oil and saw that they were breaking </span>and their contents were leaking out should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say: This is hereby </span>separated as <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and tithe for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that I have in my house. And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said </span>this, it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say anything. </span>The fact that one cannot separate produce that is about to be lost as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> or tithe indicates that such property is considered ownerless.
The Gemara answers that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yirmeya says </span>in a different context, that the ruling discussed there is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the basket of the olive pres</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped around it </span>so that the barrel would not break completely, and some of the contents would remain inside. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>here, the mishna issued its ruling only <span class="gemarra-regular">when the basket of the olive press </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped around </span>the honey barrel so that it would not break completely, and the contents are therefore not rendered ownerless.
The Gemara challenges the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said </span>that the wine or oil is separated as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> or tithe, it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say anything. But isn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was traveling on the road and had money in his possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>he saw <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruffian </span>moving <span class="gemarra-regular">toward him, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">should not say: The </span>second-tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that I have in my hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is hereby desacralized onto these coins, </span>i.e., the sanctity of the produce is hereby transferred to the coins. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement stands, </span>and the produce is desacralized while the coins attain the sanctity of the second tithe.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is capable of saving </span>his money from the ruffian and that is why he may transfer the sanctity of the second tithe to the coins. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is capable of saving </span>the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">why should he not say </span>that the produce should be desacralized <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is capable of saving </span>the money only <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficulty. </span>Consequently, he should not transfer the sanctity of the second tithe to the coins, as it may be lost; but if he does so, the transfer takes effect, as it is not certain that the money will be lost.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever there is </span>a potential <span class="gemarra-regular">loss one should not say </span>that the sanctity is transferred to the money <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But isn’t it taught </span>otherwise in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one had ten barrels of ritually impure, untithed </span>wine, i.e., first-tithe wine from which the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe had not yet been separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he saw that one of them had broken </span>and that its contents were leaking out, <span class="gemarra-regular">or that it had been expose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and is forbidden for consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may say: This </span>barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">is hereby </span>separated as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe for the other nine </span>barrels. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to oil, he should not do so due to the priest’s loss</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> issued its ruling only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">basket of the olive press </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped around </span>the barrel so that some of its contents would remain inside. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this rationale applies to a barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">that was broken, </span>as the remaining contents are still <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>for use, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to a barrel that was <span class="gemarra-regular">exposed, for what </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">is it fit?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the exposed wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for sprinkling, </span>in order to spread its pleasant aroma, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>otherwise in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">water that was exposed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour it </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, nor mix clay with it, nor settle </span>dust <span class="gemarra-regular">with it </span>by sprinkling it in <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, nor give it to his animal to drink</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor </span>give it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the animal of another. </span>This proves that exposed liquids may not be used even for sprinkling.
The Gemara answers: The wine is fit for use <span class="gemarra-regular">because he passed it through a strainer, </span>and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A vessel covered with <span class="gemarra-regular">a strainer is subject to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">exposure </span>if the vessel is left unsupervised. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya said: When </span>is this so? It is so <span class="gemarra-regular">when the lower vessel, </span>in which the liquid collects after passing through the strainer, <span class="gemarra-regular">is exposed. But when the lower vessel is covered, even if the upper vessel is exposed, it is not subject to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">exposure, because the venom of a snake is like a sponge </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">it floats and stays in place.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated with regard to </span>Rabbi Neḥemya’s ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Simon says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: They taught </span>Rabbi Neḥemya’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only where one did not mix it, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one mixed </span>the wine, any venom found in it becomes capable of penetrating the strainer? Consequently, the wine remains <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>even if it is passed through a strainer.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, too, it is possible </span>to prevent the venom from mixing with the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">by placing something upon the mouth of a barrel that will filter it </span>slowly so that the venom will not penetrate the strainer, and the wine may therefore be used.
It has now been established that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that if one’s barrel of untithed, impure wine is breaking, he may separate it as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe for other barrels of untithed, impure wine, may be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya, may we separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> from impure produce for other impure produce?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure for </span>other produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, and from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure for </span>other produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, and from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure for </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, but not from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure for </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Neḥemya says: Even </span>with regard to separating <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure for </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted one to separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">only in the case of doubtfully tithed produce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, how can the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span> unequivocally permit one to separate impure wine as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe for other impure wine? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">a case of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara discusses the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited previously: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to oil, he should not do so, due to the priest’s loss. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about a leaking barrel of impure <span class="gemarra-regular">oil, </span>which one may not separate as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, because if he does so the priest will suffer a loss? That case is different <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the impure <span class="it-text">teruma</span> oil <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit </span>to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to kindle </span>a fire, and the priest will now not receive that oil. The Gemara challenges: But <span class="gemarra-regular">wine is also fit </span>to be used, as the priest is able <span class="gemarra-regular">to sprinkle </span>it in order to impart a pleasant aroma. Why is there is no concern that the priest will suffer a loss? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling is nothing, </span>i.e., it is insignificant, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t Shmuel say in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: One drinks from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> of wine worth one <span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and one sprinkles from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> of wine worth <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>, which indicates that there is greater benefit in sprinkling wine than in drinking it?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we are dealing with new </span>wine that has not yet developed an aroma and is therefore not fit for sprinkling. The Gemara counters: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it fit to </span>allow it to <span class="gemarra-regular">age </span>so that it will become fit for sprinkling? The Gemara responds: If one waits for it to age, he might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span>experience <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishap with it, </span>as he will forget that it is impure <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, which is forbidden for consumption.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Oil </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be subject to the concern that one might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to experience a mishap with it, </span>as he might forget that it is forbidden and mistakenly drink it. The Gemara explains: The halakha is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the priest must <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the oil <span class="gemarra-regular">in a foul vessel, </span>and there is no concern that he will consume it, as such oil is used only for kindling. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the wine also be placed in a foul vessel, </span>in which case there would be no concern that he would drink it. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that he desires </span>to use <span class="gemarra-regular">it for sprinkling, would he place it in a foul vessel? </span>This would ruin its aroma. Consequently, the wine may not be kept due to concern over a possible mishap, while the oil may be kept.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the concern with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishap itself is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrel of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine that became impure </span>and is therefore forbidden for consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>

Daf 116a

The wine must <span class="gemarra-regular">all be poured ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in order to prevent a possible mishap. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>Let the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">be used </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I will decide </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> by proposing an intermediate opinion: If the wine became impure <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house, it may be used </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling, </span>as it can be used immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it became impure <span class="gemarra-regular">in the field, it must all be poured out, </span>as it is possible that by the time it is brought to the house and used for sprinkling, someone may drink it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that he decided the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to aged </span>wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">it may be used </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling, </span>as it is fit to be sprinkled immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to new </span>wine, which does not yet have a pleasant aroma, <span class="gemarra-regular">it must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all be poured out </span>in order to prevent a possible mishap. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei: <span class="gemarra-regular">A decision </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">a third </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>conclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">decide </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the owner of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the honey: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will salvage your </span>honey and you will pay me the value of my wine, the owner of the honey is obligated to give him compensation for the wine. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is the stipulation binding? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the owner of the honey <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I was </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">fooling with you </span>when I accepted your condition, and I did not agree to it at all.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one was fleein</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from prison and there was a ferry before him, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to </span>the ferryman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>this entire <span class="gemarra-regular">dinar and take me across </span>the river, the ferryman <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">only his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">wage, </span>but not the entire dinar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the prisoner could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I was </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">fooling with you </span>and never intended to pay you a full dinar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also, let</span> the owner of the honey <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner of the wine: <span class="gemarra-regular">I was </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">fooling with you.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not comparable </span>to the case cited above; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to </span>the ferryman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take this dinar as your wage and take me across </span>the river, the prisoner must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him his wage in the full amount, </span>i.e., the entire dinar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>which states that the ferryman receives only his regular wage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>which states that he receives the full dinar? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: </span>The latter clause deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with a trapper who scoops fish from the sea, </span>i.e., a fisherman, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the prisoner: <span class="gemarra-regular">You have caused me a los</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">fish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kavrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar, </span>which I would have caught had I not taken you across the river. Similarly, in the case in the mishna, the owner of the wine sustains a financial loss in order to save the honey, and therefore he is entitled to the compensation that the owner of the honey agreed to pay.
§ The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a river washed away his donkey and the donkey of the other </span>man, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his donkey is worth one hundred dinars, </span>etc. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both the case of the barrels of wine and honey and the case of the donkeys, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>case, that of the wine and honey, it might be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">that when </span>the owner of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>his stipulation, the owner of the honey <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him the value of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>loss. Why is this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">is lost through </span>the direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>of its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the donkeys, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the donkey is lost <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself </span>in the river, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say: </span>The one who salvages the donkey of his fellow <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">only his wage, </span>i.e., compensation for his labor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the mishna had <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>it might be said: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is here, </span>in the case of the donkeys, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if the intention of the one who saved the donkey was <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified, </span>i.e., he did not stipulate that the owner of the other donkey would compensate him for the loss of his own donkey, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">only his wage, because </span>the donkey is lost <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself. But there, </span>where the barrel of wine is lost <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>of its owner, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Even in </span>a case where the intention of the owner of the wine was <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified, </span>the owner of the honey must <span class="gemarra-regular">give him the value of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>barrel of wine. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, both cases are <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary.</span>
The Gemara cites a relevant discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raised a dilemma before Rav: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>into the river <span class="gemarra-regular">to rescue </span>another’s donkey instead of his own after stipulating that he would be compensated for the loss of his own donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his </span>own donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the river <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the rescuer still entitled to payment from the owner of the donkey that he saved, despite the fact that he did not suffer a monetary loss? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The rescuer is still compensated because it was <span class="gemarra-regular">from Heaven </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy was bestowed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon him, </span>and his good fortune does not affect the stipulation.
This <span class="gemarra-regular">is like that </span>case where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra was traveling in a caravan, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain lion </span>followed them, <span class="gemarra-regular">accompanying the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> along the way. <span class="gemarra-regular">Every night, </span>the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">would send one of their donkeys to </span>the lion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the lion <span class="gemarra-regular">would eat </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Safra’s time arrived </span>to provide the lion with prey, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sent it </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey but </span>the lion <span class="gemarra-regular">did not eat it. Rav Safra went ahead and acquired it </span>back, as his donkey had become ownerless when he presented it to the lion. Although Rav Safra did not lose his donkey, he had fulfilled his obligation to provide the lion with a donkey, and his good fortune did not affect his obligation vis-à-vis the other travelers.
With regard to this episode, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Why </span>was it necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for him to acquire </span>the donkey again? <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">made it ownerless </span>by sending it to the lion, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">made ownerless </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the intention that the lion </span>would consume it, but <span class="gemarra-regular">it was not made ownerless with the intention that everyone </span>else could acquire it. Accordingly, no one else could have acquired the donkey. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rav Safra did </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">as an added precaution.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav raised a dilemma before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>into the river in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to rescue </span>another’s donkey instead of his own, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>manage to <span class="gemarra-regular">rescue </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does the stipulation still apply so that the owner of the donkey he attempted to rescue must compensate him for the loss of his own donkey? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And is this a question? </span>It is clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>the right to collect <span class="gemarra-regular">only his wage, </span>but he is not entitled to the value of his own donkey.
Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who hires a laborer</span>

Daf 116b

<span class="gemarra-regular">to bring cabbage and plum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to an ill </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he went and found that </span>the patient had already <span class="gemarra-regular">died or recovered, </span>the employer nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the worker <span class="gemarra-regular">his entire wage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Evidently, one is paid for his efforts even if the desired result is not accomplished. Accordingly, the rescuer’s stipulation should apply, and one should be obligated to pay another for attempting to salvage his donkey even if he did not actually succeed in doing so.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Are </span>those two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, </span>in the case of the ill person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the agent performed his assignment, </span>as he procured and delivered the foods to the ill person, but <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the donkeys, <span class="gemarra-regular">the agent did not perform his assignment, </span>as he was unable to rescue the animal from the river.
§ Apropos the episode involving Rav Safra, the Gemara discusses the division of expenses among travelers in a caravan. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan that was traveling in the deser</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a troop </span>of bandits <span class="gemarra-regular">stood over it </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>attack and <span class="gemarra-regular">pillage </span>it, and the members of the caravan agreed to pay ransom to the bandits, they <span class="gemarra-regular">calculate </span>each traveler’s contribution <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>he is carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not calculate according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">souls </span>in the caravan, i.e., the expense is not divided equally among the travelers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if they hired a scout who travels in front of them </span>and leads them safely through the desert, the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">calculate </span>each one’s contribution to paying the scout’s wages <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the number of <span class="gemarra-regular">souls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And they should not differ from the </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">custom of donkey drivers, </span>who often have set procedures for such situations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The donkey drivers are permitted to stipulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone whose donkey becomes lost, </span>the caravan <span class="gemarra-regular">will provide him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a different donkey. </span>If the donkey was lost <span class="gemarra-regular">through negligence, they do not provide him </span>with another donkey, but if it was lost <span class="gemarra-regular">not through negligence, they provide him </span>with another donkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>the individual whose donkey became lost <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Give me </span>money instead of the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will guard </span>the caravan along with everyone else, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not listen to him.</span>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">has another donkey, lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he will guard </span>the caravan <span class="gemarra-regular">for its </span>sake. Since he still owns one donkey, he never lost his incentive to guard the caravan, and the other drivers should therefore give him money if he wishes. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">guarding one </span>donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from guarding two </span>donkeys, and the driver will be more likely to guard the caravan properly if they supply him with another donkey.
§ The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses the division of expenses among a group. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a boat that was traveling on the se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> when <span class="gemarra-regular">a gale arose </span>and threatened <span class="gemarra-regular">to sink it, and </span>the sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">lightened its load </span>by throwing some of their belongings overboard, the sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">calculate </span>the amount that each must throw out <span class="gemarra-regular">according to weight, but </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not calculate </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>how much <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>the items are worth. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they should not differ from the </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">custom of sailors.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if a number of boats are traveling together, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sailors are permitted to stipulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone whose boat was lost, </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">will provide him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a different boat. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>boat <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through negligence, </span>the other sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">do not provide </span>him with another boat, but if it was lost <span class="gemarra-regular">not through negligence, </span>the sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">provide him </span>with another boat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">sailed to a place where the boats do not travel, </span>the other sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">do not provide </span>him with a different boat.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary because in </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Nisan, </span>the boats <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>themselves from the shore by <span class="gemarra-regular">one rope </span>length, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tishrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>themselves by <span class="gemarra-regular">two rope </span>lengths. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case, the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">was traveling during Nisan </span>and sailed <span class="gemarra-regular">to the place </span>where boats sail during <span class="gemarra-regular">Tishrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lest you say </span>that the sailor is not considered negligent because he <span class="gemarra-regular">is taking his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">route and traveling </span>as he is accustomed to, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that his actions are considered negligent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan that was traveling in the desert and a troop </span>of bandits <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>over it <span class="gemarra-regular">and pillaged it, and one of </span>the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and rescue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the caravan from the bandits, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has rescued </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for the common </span>good, i.e., each member of the caravan receives back his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he stated: I will rescue </span>the property from the bandits <span class="gemarra-regular">for myself, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">rescued </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>and he is now the legal owner of all the property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>each member of the caravan is <span class="gemarra-regular">able to rescue </span>his property, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause, </span>where the rescuer states that he is saving the property for himself, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be that the possessions are rescued <span class="gemarra-regular">for the common </span>good, as the other members of the caravan did not despair of retrieving their property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>each member of the caravan is <span class="gemarra-regular">unable to rescue </span>his property, they despair of retrieving their property and relinquish ownership of it. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be that the possessions are saved <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, </span>so that he is their legal owner. Why is there a discrepancy between the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the first clause and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the latter clause?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: Here, </span>in the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a caravan whose members are <span class="gemarra-regular">partner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and jointly own the confiscated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, a partner may divide </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">without the other </span>partner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">consent. </span>Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that he intends to save the property for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has</span> dissolved the partnership and <span class="gemarra-regular">divided </span>the property so that if he is able to rescue only some of the property, the property he rescues is his share of the joint property. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>that he intends to save the property for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not divided </span>the property, and whatever he rescues is jointly owned by the partners.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava stated </span>a different answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with laborer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who were hired to protect the caravan, and one of these guards saved the travelers’ property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, as Rav says: A laborer may retract </span>his commitment to his employer <span class="gemarra-regular">even in the middle of the day.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As long as he did not retract </span>his commitment, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered </span>to be under the <span class="gemarra-regular">jurisdiction of the employer, </span>so that anything he saves automatically belongs to the employer. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when he retracts </span>his commitment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a different reason </span>that he is able to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants” </span>(Leviticus 25:55), indicating that Jews are servants of God, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not servants of servants, </span>i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, it is permitted for a laborer to conclude his term of employment whenever he wants. Once he does so, if he saves property that the members of the caravan are unable to rescue, the property belongs to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi stated </span>another answer: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the other members of the caravan are <span class="gemarra-regular">able to rescue </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he revealed his intention </span>to rescue the property for himself and the other travelers did not protest, it is clear that they have despaired of recovering their property, and the rescuer has secured the property <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not reveal his intention </span>to rescue the property for himself, the status quo remains and the property has been rescued <span class="gemarra-regular">for the common </span>good.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs a field from an-other and thugs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">massikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the field from the robber, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is dependent upon the circumstances: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is a regional disaster </span>in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the owner of the field: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yours is before you, </span>i.e., it is your prerogative to try to reclaim it from the thugs. No compensation is required since the thugs would have seized the property in any event. But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the thugs took that field alone <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the robber, </span>the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to provide </span>the owner with <span class="gemarra-regular">a different field.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One who teaches </span>the mishna using the term <span class="gemarra-italic">massikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not err, and one who teaches </span>the mishna using the term <span class="gemarra-italic">matzikin</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">does not err, </span>as both terms may be used to refer to thugs. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who teaches</span> the mishna using the term <span class="gemarra-italic">matzikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not err, as it is written: “In the siege and in the distress [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">matzok</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>with which your enemies shall distress you” (Deuteronomy 28:55). Consequently, <span class="it-text">matzikin</span> are individuals who cause distress to others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one who teaches</span> the mishna using the term <span class="gemarra-italic">massikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not err, as it is written: </span>“All your trees and the fruit of your land <span class="gemarra-regular">shall the locust consume” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:42), <span class="gemarra-regular">and, </span>in the standard Aramaic translation, <span class="gemarra-regular">we translate </span>this phrase as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall the locust [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sakke’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] consume. </span>Consequently, <span class="it-text">massikin</span> are those who consume the property of others.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the thugs took the field <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the robber, </span>the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to provide the owner with a different field. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case in the latter clause of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they seized </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">his land, </span>i.e., the robber’s land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not seize all </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">lands </span>in the region, <span class="gemarra-regular">you already learned this from the first clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is a regional disaster </span>in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber is not obligated to compensate the owner of the field, which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is not </span>a regional disaster, the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>exempt from payment. What novelty does the latter clause teach?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the individual did not actually take control of the property before it was seized by the thugs, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">showed </span>the field to the thugs and thereby facilitated their occupation of the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">A different version </span>of this answer is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>A case <span class="gemarra-regular">where gentiles coerced </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">and told him to show them his lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for them to seize, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he showed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>field belonging to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">along with </span>his own fields, and the thugs then seized all the land he showed them.
The Gemara recounts a related incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who showed piles of wheat, </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Exilarch’s household, </span>to thugs, who seized them. The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman </span>for judgment, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman deemed </span>that man <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>the Exilarch for the stolen wheat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef was sitting behind Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya was sitting before Rav Naḥman. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said to Rav Naḥman: </span>Did you deem him liable to pay because that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or </span>was it <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine?</span>
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This individual’s liability <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>written explicitly in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>i.e., it is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>thugs took the field <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the robber, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to provide </span>the owner with a different <span class="gemarra-regular">field. And it was established </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">showed </span>the field to thugs, who later seized it. So too, in this case, the one who showed the Exilarch’s wheat pile to the thugs is obligated to pay for them. <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">left, Rav Yosef said to Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya: What difference does it make to you</span>

Daf 117a

<span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine? </span>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we learn from it </span>and apply this ruling to other cases, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, we do not learn from it, </span>as it is possible that Rav Naḥman had a specific reason to impose a fine in this case.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that we do not learn from </span>the imposition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine </span>in one case and apply the ruling in other cases? The Gemara answers that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renders </span>another’s food <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, </span>thereby rendering it unfit for him to consume, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who pours </span>another’s wine as <span class="gemarra-regular">a libatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for idol worship, thereby rendering it an item from which deriving benefit is prohibited, are liable to pay the owner for the financial loss they caused despite the fact that the fact that damage is not evident. <span class="gemarra-regular">Subsequently, </span>they added to this list, <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even one who intermingles </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span>, the portion of the produce designated for the priest, with another’s non-sacred produce, thereby rendering the non-sacred food forbidden to non-priests, is liable to compensate the owner for the loss of value of the produce, as fewer people will be willing to buy it from him.
The Gemara comments: It may be inferred from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is only because the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently </span>added to the list that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one who intermingles <span class="it-text">teruma</span> with another’s non-sacred produce must compensate him. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">they had not subsequently </span>added to the list, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that we do not learn that he is liable from the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours wine as a libation for idol worship, as this is also a case in which one causes damage that is not evident? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not due to </span>the fact that his payment <span class="gemarra-regular">is a fine, and </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine, we do not learn from </span>one case that it may be imposed in other circumstances?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not the reason. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">maintained </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">were concerned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a large </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">loss, </span>e.g., the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours his wine as a libation for idol worship, but with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a small </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">loss, </span>e.g., one who intermingles <span class="it-text">teruma</span> with another’s non-sacred produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">they were not concerned. And ultimately </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">maintained </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">were concerned </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a small loss as well </span>and imposed liability.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t the father of Rabbi Avin teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially they would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renders </span>another’s produce <span class="gemarra-regular">impure and one who intermingles </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> with another’s non-sacred produce are both liable to pay for the financial loss that they caused, despite the fact that the damage is not evident. <span class="gemarra-regular">Subsequently, </span>they added to this list, <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even one who pours </span>another’s wine as <span class="gemarra-regular">a libation </span>for idol worship is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>liable to pay a fine for the loss that he caused. It may be inferred that it is only because the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequently </span>added to the list, that <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one who pours the libation is liable. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">they had not subsequently </span>added to the list, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be liable.
The Gemara comments: Since one who offers libations for idol worship causes a large financial loss, the rationale offered previously cannot apply to this version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that the liability for pouring another’s wine as a libation could not be extrapolated from the fine imposed for rendering another’s food impure or intermingling it with <span class="it-text">teruma</span>? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not learn from </span>the imposition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine </span>in one case that a fine may be imposed in other cases?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not the reason. Rather, the reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">held in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin, and ultimately they held in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially they held in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin, as Rabbi Avin says: </span>If one stood in the public domain on Shabbat and <span class="gemarra-regular">shot an arro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the beginning of </span>an area measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">to the end of </span>an area measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the arrow <span class="gemarra-regular">tore </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">silks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shira’in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the course of <span class="gemarra-regular">its travel </span>through the air, the one who threw it is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying for the cloth. The reason for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that lifting </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">is a necessity for placing </span>it elsewhere, and therefore the entire process, from when one shoots the arrow until it comes to a rest, is considered to be a single act. The one performing it is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty for violating Shabbat. One who performs a single act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty and is also liable to pay money receives only the death penalty. Similarly, one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship incurs the death penalty, and is therefore exempt from paying for the wine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And ultimately they held </span>that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya, as Rabbi Yirmeya says: From the time of the lifting, </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the wine and is therefore immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">money to </span>the owner. But <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time </span>that he pours the <span class="gemarra-regular">libation. </span>Once the Sages concluded that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, they ruled that one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship is liable to reimburse him.
§ The Gemara returns to the matter of one who showed another’s field to thugs. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Bei Abiyonei </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did any </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">incident come to you </span>for judgment recently? Rav Huna bar Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>There was a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew whom gentiles coerced and, </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he showed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another, </span>which the gentiles later seized. He <span class="gemarra-regular">came to me </span>for judgment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I deemed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to compensate the owner for the loss.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> Rav Huna bar Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>your decision in this <span class="gemarra-regular">case </span>and return the money <span class="gemarra-regular">to its owner, </span>i.e., the thug, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew whom gentiles coerce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and, </span>as a result <span class="gemarra-regular">he showed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>that the gentiles later seized, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from reimbursing the owner of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he </span>actively <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave </span>it to the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to compensate the owner.
The Gemara adds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: If he showed </span>the gentiles the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of his own </span>volition, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he </span>actively <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave </span>it to the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand, </span>and he is liable to compensate the owner.
The Gemara recounts another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man that gentiles </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">coerced and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">he showed them the wine of Rav Mari, son of Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ḥisda, and </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Carry </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring it with us. </span>Complying with the gentiles, <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried and brought </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with them. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Ashi, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted </span>the man from compensating Rav Mari for the wine.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">and manually transferred </span>it to the gentiles, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to compensate the owner? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: That statement applies </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">did not bring </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset; but if he brought </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outset, </span>it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">burned </span>it, as the gentiles then had access to the property. Since the damage inflicted by the Jew was committed by merely showing the wine to the gentiles, he is exempt from payment even though he later actively carried the wine with his hands.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruffian said to </span>a Jew: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pass me this bundle of grain, or this cluster of grapes, and </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">passed it to him, </span>the Jew is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the owner of the grain or the grapes. Since the ruffian was already present, it is evident from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that one who hands over another’s property to a third party is liable despite the fact that the latter already had access to it. Rav Ashi answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the Jew and the ruffian were <span class="gemarra-regular">standing on two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">sides of a river, </span>so that the ruffian did not have access to the item when the Jew passed it to him.
The Gemara points out that the language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>its ruling using the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pass, </span>which indicates that the ruffian could not have reached the item himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">did not teach </span>using the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give, </span>which would indicate that the ruffian was standing next to the other individual. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Rav Ashi’s interpretation is correct.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>fishing <span class="gemarra-regular">net over which two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were quarreling. This one said: It is mine, and that one said: It is mine. One of them went and gave it to an officer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lefarhagna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the king. Abaye said: </span>He is exempt from payment because <span class="gemarra-regular">he can say </span>to the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I gave </span>it to the official, <span class="gemarra-regular">I gave </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">mine. Rava said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is it in his </span>power to do so when the ownership of the net is the subject of dispute? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: We excommunicate hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until he brings </span>the net back <span class="gemarra-regular">and stands in court </span>for adjudication.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who desired to show another </span>individual’s <span class="gemarra-regular">straw </span>to the gentile authorities, who would seize it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came before Rav, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do not show </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and do not show </span>it, i.e., you are absolutely prohibited from showing it. The man <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will show </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will show </span>it, i.e., I will certainly show it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was sitting before Rav, </span>and, hearing the man’s disrespectful response, <span class="gemarra-regular">he dislodged </span>the man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">nec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from him, </span>i.e., he broke his neck and killed him.
Seeing Rav Kahana’s action, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav read </span>the following verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about him: “Your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net” </span>(Isaiah 51:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this antelope, once it falls into the net, </span>the hunter <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have mercy upon it, so too </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the money of a Jew, once it falls into the hand of gentiles, they do not have mercy upon him, </span>i.e., the Jew. Since gentiles who seek a Jew’s money will kill him in order to seize the property, Rav Kahana acted appropriately when he broke the miscreant’s neck, as he protected the Jew’s property and, by extension, the Jew himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: <span class="gemarra-regular">Kahana, until now there were Persian </span>rulers <span class="gemarra-regular">who were not particular about bloodshed. But now there are Greek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are particular about bloodshed, and they </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Murder [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meradin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> murder, </span>and they will press charges against you. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">get up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend to Eretz Yisrael </span>to study there under Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">and accept upon yourself that you will not raise </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">difficultie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the statements of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven years.</span>
Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>to Eretz Yisrael and <span class="gemarra-regular">found Reish Lakish, who was sitting and reviewing </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <span class="gemarra-regular">daily </span>lecture in the <span class="gemarra-regular">academy for the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the students in the academy. When he finished, Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the students: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where is Reish Lakish? They said to him: Why </span>do you wish to see him? Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>I have <span class="gemarra-regular">this difficulty and that difficulty </span>with his review of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this resolution and that resolution </span>to the questions he raised. <span class="gemarra-regular">They told </span>this to <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">went and said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: A lion has ascended from Babylonia, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>ought <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine </span>the discourse he will deliver <span class="gemarra-regular">in the academy tomorrow, </span>as Rav Kahana may raise difficult questions about the material.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The next day, they seated </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first row, in front of Rabbi Yoḥanan. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">stated a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">did not raise a difficulty, </span>in accordance with Rav’s instruction. Rabbi Yoḥanan stated another <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>again, Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">did not raise a difficulty. </span>As a result, <span class="gemarra-regular">they placed </span>Rav Kahana further <span class="gemarra-regular">back </span>by one row. This occurred until he had been moved back <span class="gemarra-regular">seven rows, until he was seated in the last row. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: The lion you mentioned has become a fox, </span>i.e., he is not knowledgeable.
Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">May it be </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will that these seven rows </span>I have been moved <span class="gemarra-regular">should replace the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven years that Rav told me </span>to wait before raising difficulties to the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <span class="gemarra-regular">He stood up on his feet and said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: Let the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master go back to the beginning </span>of the discourse and repeat what he said. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">stated a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a difficulty. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">they placed him in the first row, </span>and again, Rav Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">stated a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he raised a difficulty.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan was sitting upon seven cushions [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bistarkei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> so that he could be seen by all the students, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since he could not answer Rav Kahana’s questions, <span class="gemarra-regular">he removed one cushion from under himself </span>to demonstrate that he was lowering himself out of respect for Rav Kahana. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>another <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty. </span>This happened repeatedly <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">removed all the cushions from underneath himself until he was sitting on the ground. Rabbi Yoḥanan was an old man and his eyebrows drooped </span>over his eyes. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>his students: <span class="gemarra-regular">Uncover my eyes for me and I will see </span>Rav Kahana, so <span class="gemarra-regular">they uncovered </span>his eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">for him with a silver eye brush.</span>
Once his eyes were uncovered, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that </span>Rav Kahana’s <span class="gemarra-regular">lips were spli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">was smirking at him. </span>As a result, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">was offended, and </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>as punishment for the fact that he offended Rabbi Yoḥanan. <span class="gemarra-regular">The next day, Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the Rabbis, </span>his students: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did you see how that Babylonian, </span>Rav Kahana, <span class="gemarra-regular">behaved </span>in such a disrespectful manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: His </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>of appearance <span class="gemarra-regular">is such, </span>and he was not mocking you. Hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">went up to </span>Rav Kahana’s burial <span class="gemarra-regular">cave </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was</span>

Daf 117b

<span class="gemarra-regular">encircled by a serpent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which had placed its tail in its mouth, completely encircling the cave and blocking the entrance. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to it: Serpent, serpent, open your mouth and </span>allow <span class="gemarra-regular">the teacher </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>and be <span class="gemarra-regular">near the disciple, but </span>the serpent <span class="gemarra-regular">did not open </span>its mouth to allow him entry. He then said: Allow <span class="gemarra-regular">a colleague </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>and be <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">colleague, but </span>still the serpent <span class="gemarra-regular">did not open </span>its mouth. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Allow the <span class="gemarra-regular">disciple </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>and be <span class="gemarra-regular">near the teacher, </span>referring to Rav Kahana as his own teacher. The snake then <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>its mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>to allow him entry. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">requested </span>divine <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy </span>from God and <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>Rav Kahana from the dead.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had I known that this was the Master’s manner </span>of appearance, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not have been offended. Now </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master come with me </span>to the study hall. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If you are able to request </span>divine <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will not die again</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will go </span>with you, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, I will not go </span>with you. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the time </span>decreed for his death <span class="gemarra-regular">had passed, it had passed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan then completely <span class="gemarra-regular">awakened him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">stood him up. </span>Thereafter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he asked him </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">every uncertainty that he had, and </span>Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">them for him. And this is </span>the background to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</span> to his students on several occasions: What <span class="gemarra-regular">I said was yours is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">theirs, </span>i.e., I thought that the Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael were the most advanced, but in fact the scholars of Babylonia are the most advanced, as evidenced by Rav Kahana’s knowledge.
§ The Gemara relates another incident pertaining to one who informed gentiles of the whereabouts of another Jew’s property. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who showed Rabbi Abba’s silk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ametakesa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to gentiles, who later seized it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa sat </span>together to determine whether Rabbi Abba was entitled to compensation from the informer, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Ile’a sat next to them.</span>
The judges <span class="gemarra-regular">thought to deem </span>the informer <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to reimburse Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">based upon that which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 28b): If a judge <span class="gemarra-regular">issued a judgment </span>and erred, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquitted </span>one who was in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed liable </span>one who should have in fact been <span class="gemarra-regular">acquitted, </span>or if he <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pure </span>item is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure </span>item is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">what he did is done, </span>i.e., the judgment stands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the judge <span class="gemarra-regular">must pay </span>damages <span class="gemarra-regular">from his home, </span>i.e., from his personal funds. This indicates that one is liable to pay for a financial loss that he causes even if his involvement was only through speech.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ile’a said to them: This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: And that </span>mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the money from the one whom he found liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave </span>it to the other party <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span> his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand. </span>Consequently, it cannot serve as a precedent to render the informer liable in this case. The Sages serving as judges <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go to Rabbi Shimon ben Elyaki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, who rule </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">liability </span>for damage caused by <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action.
Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">went to them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they deemed </span>the informer <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to reimburse Rabbi Abba, as it is taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mishna: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the thugs seized the field <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the robber, he is liable to provide </span>the owner with <span class="gemarra-regular">a different field. And it was established that </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">showed </span>the field to thugs who later seized it. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated in the mishna would apply to this case as well.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">whom a silver cup was deposited. Thieves came upon him </span>in his home and <span class="gemarra-regular">he took </span>the cup and <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to them. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabba, </span>and Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted him </span>from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: This </span>individual is <span class="gemarra-regular">saving himself with another’s property, </span>and he should therefore be liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said, </span>in explanation of Rabba’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">We look </span>at his financial status: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">is a wealthy man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the thieves <span class="gemarra-regular">came with the intent </span>to steal <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>property, and he is therefore liable to pay, as he saved himself from financial loss by handing over another’s property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>wealthy, the thieves presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">came with the intent </span>to steal <span class="gemarra-regular">the silver </span>cup, and he is therefore exempt from liability.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man with whom the purse </span>containing funds collected <span class="gemarra-regular">for the redemption of captives was deposited. Thieves came upon him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he took </span>the purse and <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to them. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabba, </span>and Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted him </span>from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is saving himself with another’s property, </span>and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have no greater redemption of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> captives than this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the man used the money to avoid being harmed by the thieves, Rabba considered the money to have been used for its intended purpose.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who hastened and brought his donkey </span>onboard <span class="gemarra-regular">a ferry [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lemavra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boarded the ferry. </span>The donkey began to move around and <span class="gemarra-regular">was about </span>to cause the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">to sink. A certain </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">man came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed the donkey of that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">man into the river, and it drowned. </span>The case <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabba, </span>and Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted him </span>from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is saving himself with another’s property, </span>and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span>owner of the donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a pursuer from the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he endangered the other travelers. It is permitted to stop a pursuer by any means necessary, including by destroying his property.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rabba says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pursuer who was chasing after another </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to kill him and </span>the pursuer <span class="gemarra-regular">broke vessels </span>during the chase, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pursued </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">or to anyone </span>else, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from reimbursing the owner of the vessels. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty for attempted murder and is consequently exempt from any monetary liability he incurs simultaneously.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And a pursued </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who broke the vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the pursuer </span>is also <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the pursuer’s property shall not be cherished more than his body, </span>i.e., his life. Since it is permitted to kill the pursuer in order to save his intended victim, it is permitted to destroy his property for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he destroyed property <span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to anyone </span>else, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to reimburse them, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is prohibited </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to save himself with another’s property.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pursuer who was chasing after </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">pursue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to save </span>the latter’s intended victim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">broke vessels </span>during the chase, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">belonged to the pursued </span>individual, i.e., the individual attempting murder, <span class="gemarra-regular">or to anyone </span>else, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from payment. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is not </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">law, but if you do not say so, you </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">person that saves another from a pursuer. </span>In order to encourage people to attempt to save the lives of others, the Sages instituted that one who damages another’s property in the process of saving a life is exempt from payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a river flooded </span>a misappropriated field, the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>its owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you, </span>and no compensation is required. Since the field would have been flooded in any case, the robber has not caused the damage to the field, and is therefore exempt.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robbed a field from another and a river </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">flooded it, </span>the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to provide </span>the field’s owner with <span class="gemarra-regular">a different field. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say: </span>He is exempt from doing so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you.</span>
The Gemara analyzes this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar interpreted </span>the verses: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit…or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full” (Leviticus 5:21–24), according to the hermeneutical principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">amplifications and restrictions. </span>The phrase: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">and deal falsely with his neighbor,” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an amplification. </span>When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In a matter of deposit,”</span> it has <span class="gemarra-regular">restricted </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to the case of a deposit. When the verse then states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or anything about which he has sworn falsely, </span>he shall restore it in full,” <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">then amplified </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> again.
Accordingly, as the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">restricted and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>again, it has <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to include <span class="gemarra-regular">everything, </span>with only a single exception. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is included due to the fact that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">has amplified </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">has amplified </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to include <span class="gemarra-regular">everything </span>that one steals.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is excluded due to the fact that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">restricted </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It restricted </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in order to exclude financial <span class="gemarra-regular">documents, </span>which are dissimilar to a deposit in that their value is not intrinsic, but rather due to their function. Consequently, according to Rabbi Elazar, land that was stolen is included in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis interpreted </span>these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">generalizations and details. </span>The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And deal falsely </span>with his neighbor,” is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>while the subsequent phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In a matter of deposit,” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail. </span>When the verse then states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or anything </span>about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">then generalized </span>again. In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail.</span>
Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the detail, </span>i.e., a deposit, <span class="gemarra-regular">is movable property and </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the verse includes <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is movable property and </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">land has been excluded, as it is not movable property. Slaves have been excluded, as they are compared to land </span>with regard to many areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. Financial <span class="gemarra-regular">documents have been </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excluded because, although they </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">movable property, they do not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">intrinsic monetary </span>value.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robbed </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow and a river washed it away, </span>the robber is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to provide </span>the owner with another <span class="gemarra-regular">cow; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say: </span>The robber can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is yours is before you, </span>and he would consequently be exempt. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what do they disagree? </span>The rationale offered previously cannot apply, as a cow is movable property and has intrinsic value, and yet Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis still disagree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: There, with what are we dealing? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">robbed another of a field, and there was</span>

Daf 118a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a prone cow in it, and a river washed it </span>away. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as he maintains that land is included in the category of items that are not subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of robbery. Consequently, the robber acquires the land and simultaneously becomes liable to return it. Since he acquires the land, he acquires the cow that is on the land as well, and is liable to compensate its owner when it gets washed away by the river. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>conform <span class="gemarra-regular">to their </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as they hold that land was excluded by the verse. Therefore, the robber does not acquire the land and also does not acquire the cow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">borrowed </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">with whom </span>another had <span class="gemarra-regular">deposited </span>an item, if any of these interactions took place <span class="gemarra-regular">in a settled area, he may not return </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">to him in an unsettled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where it is of little benefit to the owner and he cannot safeguard it. If the loan or deposit was given <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">may go out </span>and return it to the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">in an unsettled area, he may return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him in an unsettled area.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>to the mishna from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A loan may be repaid in any location, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item and a deposit are returned only in their location, </span>i.e., the same type of place, settled or unsettled, where they were found or received. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: A loan may be claimed </span>by the creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">in any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">location</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Yet, if the borrower initiates the process of repaying the loan in an unsettled area, the creditor may refuse to accept the repayment until they reach a settled area. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">a lost item and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deposi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">may be claimed only in their location.</span>
The mishna teaches that if the loan or deposit was given <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition </span>that the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">may go out </span>and return it to the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">in an unsettled area, </span>he may do so. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that an explicit stipulation to this effect is binding? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, as </span>the mishna is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the depositor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the bailee: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let this deposit be with you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as I am going out to an unsettled area, and </span>the bailee <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I also need to go out to an unsettled area, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">if I need to return </span>the deposit <span class="gemarra-regular">to you there, </span>I will <span class="gemarra-regular">return it to you </span>there.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: I robbed you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You lent me </span>money, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">You deposited </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, and I do not know if I returned </span>your property <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">if I did not return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable to pay </span>the sum or item in question. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to him: I do not know if I robbed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: I do not know <span class="gemarra-regular">if you lent me money, </span>or: I do not know <span class="gemarra-regular">if you deposited </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying </span>the sum or item in question.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a related dispute: It <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that if one individual says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other says: I do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> whether or not this is true, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay the plaintiff, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying.
The Gemara explains the reason for each opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay, because when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>claim <span class="gemarra-regular">and an uncertain </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the certain </span>claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">superior. Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying because of the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Establish the money in the possession of its owner, </span>i.e., money is not taken from one’s possession without clear proof that he is liable to pay it.
The Gemara attempts to derive a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said to him: I do not know if you lent me money, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the mishna is discussing a case where the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">did not claim </span>the money from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, the first clause </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>discuss a situation where the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">did not claim </span>the money from him. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay in the case discussed in the first clause? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna must be discussing a case where the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">did claim </span>the money from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, and the latter clause </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the borrower is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from paying, </span>even though his claim is uncertain and that of the lender is certain. This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">did not claim </span>the money from <span class="gemarra-regular">him, and the first clause </span>is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to fulfill </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to Heaven.</span>
The Gemara adds that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was also stated: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: I </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in your possession, and the other </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I do not know </span>whether or not this is true, the latter is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay. This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes to fulfill </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to Heaven </span>even though he cannot be forced to pay. This statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who stole a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from a flock and returned it </span>without informing the owner that he had done so, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it died or was stolen, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">restitution </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>lamb’s <span class="gemarra-regular">owners did not know </span>about the entire incident, i.e., they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>know <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was stolen and </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>know <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was returned, and they counted the </span>flock of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep and </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">it whole, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from paying.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara presents several ways to understand the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav says: </span>In a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had knowledge </span>of the fact that their lamb was stolen, the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to return it with the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge </span>of the owners in order to be exempt from liability if the lamb is subsequently harmed. In a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knowledge </span>that the lamb was taken, their <span class="gemarra-regular">count </span>of the flock after the thief returned it <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>the thief from further liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>flock of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep and </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">it whole, </span>it is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause, </span>i.e., the case where the owners were unaware that the lamb was stolen, as it is specifically in that case that the count exempts the thief from liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: Whether </span>the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had knowledge </span>of the theft <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not have knowledge </span>of it, their <span class="gemarra-regular">count </span>of the flock <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>the thief from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And they counted </span>the flock of sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">it whole, </span>the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the entire </span>mishna, as this exempts the thief from liability in both cases mentioned in the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>In a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had knowledge </span>of the theft, their <span class="gemarra-regular">count </span>of the flock <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>the thief, and in a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had no knowledge </span>of the theft, <span class="gemarra-regular">even counting is not required </span>for the thief to be exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And they counted the </span>flock of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep and </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">it whole, </span>it is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first clause </span>of the mishna, as it is particularly in that case that the count is relevant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda says: </span>In a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had knowledge </span>of the theft, their <span class="gemarra-regular">count </span>of the flock <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>the thief. In a case where the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">had no knowledge </span>of the theft, the thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to return the lamb with their <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge </span>in order to become exempt from liability for future damage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And they counted the </span>flock of <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep and </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">it whole, </span>it is referring specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>of the mishna, where the owners were aware of the theft, as it is only in that case that counting the flock is sufficient to exempt the thief from further liability.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says: </span>

Daf 118b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reasoning of Rav Ḥisda, </span>who holds that the requirement to return the animal with the owner’s knowledge is in the case where the owners did not know about the theft? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the lamb to take <span class="gemarra-regular">steps outside, </span>i.e., to leave the owners’ property, it will now require greater supervision, which the owners can provide only if they are aware of the situation.
The Gemara assumes that since Rava explained Rav Ḥisda’s reasoning, he accepts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Rava </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Doesn’t Rava say </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">this person who saw another lift a lamb from his flock </span>in order to steal it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the owner then <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">voice at </span>the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">discarded it, but </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not know if </span>the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>the lamb or <span class="gemarra-regular">if he did not return it, and </span>the lamb then <span class="gemarra-regular">died or was stolen, </span>the thief is to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">restitution </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">it?</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is this statement of Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">counted </span>his flock after this incident? Accordingly, Rava rules that if the owner knew about the theft, the thief is rendered exempt from liability only if he returns the lamb with the owner’s knowledge, which is not in accordance with the ruling of Rav Ḥisda. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rava’s ruling applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">did not count </span>the flock.
The Gemara examines Rav’s ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Doesn’t Rav say </span>that if the thief <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>the lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">flock that is in an unsettled area, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>his obligation to return it? This indicates that the thief is exempt from further liability even though the thief did not inform the owner of the lamb’s return and the owner did not count the flock. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan bar Abba said: Rav concedes </span>that the thief is exempt in this case only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the lamb was <span class="gemarra-regular">spotted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">birkuata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the lamb’s spots are distinctive, the owner immediately becomes aware of its return.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the amoraic dispute cited previously is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who steals a lamb from a flock or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from a purse </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the place </span>from where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>it; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>The thief is <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to return it with the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners.</span>
The Gemara explains: The Sages discussing the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed that everyone accepts </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> constantly, </span>and therefore becomes aware of the theft soon after it takes place. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> was stolen with the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge, and </span>the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <span class="gemarra-regular">to the dispute of Rav and Shmuel? </span>According to this explanation, Rav rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>they disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lamb that </span>was stolen <span class="gemarra-regular">without the knowledge </span>of its owners, i.e., they did not know that it was stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <span class="gemarra-regular">to the dispute of Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Yoḥanan. </span>Rav Ḥisda rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva that the lamb must be returned with the owner’s knowledge, and Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael that the owners do not need to become aware of the lamb’s return.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: With regard to a bailee who stole </span>a lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">from the owner’s domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone, </span>including Rabbi Yishmael, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda, </span>and the owner must be aware of the animal’s return in order for the thief to become exempt from further liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here it is with regard to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a bailee who stole from </span>within <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">domain may return </span>what he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">to the place from </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stole </span>it that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. Rabbi Akiva holds: His safeguarding was terminated </span>when he stole the lamb and he must therefore return it with the owner’s knowledge. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yishmael holds: His safeguarding was not terminated </span>and he may return it to his own domain.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that with regard to the dispute over whether the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">counting </span>of his flock <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>a thief who returned a stolen lamb without notifying the owner, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who robbed another and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">included </span>the money he owed <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>for the robbery <span class="gemarra-regular">in the calculation </span>of the payment for a different transaction, i.e., he compensated the owner by overpaying him for a different transaction, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>his obligation to pay, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">not fulfilled </span>his obligation to pay.
The Sages discussing the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">assumed that everyone accepts </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purse constantly, </span>and therefore becomes aware that he has been compensated soon after the payment is made. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not with regard to this </span>following point that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree: The one who says </span>that the robber has <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">counting </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>a robber from further liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who says </span>that the robber has <span class="gemarra-regular">not fulfilled </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">counting does not exempt </span>a robber from further liability.
The Gemara responds: One can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if we held in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak, </span>it would follow that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">counting </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>a robber from further liability. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>itself that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage accepts </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage does not accept </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yitzḥak.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone accepts </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult: This </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which rules that the robber fulfilled his obligation, is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">counted </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed it </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">purse, </span>which the owner will soon open and count. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which rules that the robber did not fulfill his obligation, is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he counted </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed it in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hand. </span>Consequently, it is possible that the owner will put the money directly into a container with other coins in it and will never realize that he was compensated for the theft.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">counted </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed it in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">purse. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> discusses a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has other dinars in his purse, </span>but he did not know how many. Therefore, when he counts the money, he will not realize that the robber inserted an additional sum. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not have other dinars in his purse, </span>so that when he counts the money he will realize that an additional sum has been included in the payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not purchase wool, milk, and kids from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shepherd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who tend the flocks of others, due to the concern that they have stolen these items from the owners of the flocks. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and produce from produce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">watchmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But one may purchase from wome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, and calves in the Sharon, </span>as women in these locations often work with those commodities and it can be assumed that they are selling the items with the owner’s consent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>items, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">told </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to conceal </span>the purchase, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited, </span>as there is good reason to suspect that the items are stolen. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may purchase eggs and chickens from everywhere, </span>as it is unlikely that one would steal and sell these commodities.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase from shepherds neither goats, nor kids, nor fleeces, nor torn </span>pieces <span class="gemarra-regular">of wool, but one may purchase sewn </span>garments <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, because they are </span>presumed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">theirs. And one may purchase milk and cheese from them in an unsettled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but not in a settled area.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one may purchase from them four or five sheep </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five fleeces </span>at a time, because it is unlikely that a shepherd would risk stealing such a significant quantity at once. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">two sheep, and </span>similarly, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">two fleeces </span>at a time, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would attempt to steal this amount from the owner.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, </span>as it is unlikely that the shepherds would steal them from their owner, who would notice if they did not return home. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not purchase desert, </span>i.e., non-domesticated, animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, </span>as it is more likely that a shepherd would steal these animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">The principle of the matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that the shepherd sells and</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">perceive its </span>absence if it were stolen, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may purchase </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. </span>But if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">would not perceive its </span>absence, one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not purchase </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them.</span>
The Gemara examines the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may purchase from them four or five sheep </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five fleeces </span>at a time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">buy four </span>sheep, as it is unlikely that the shepherd would steal such a large quantity at one time, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that we may buy <span class="gemarra-regular">five? </span>The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The meaning of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that one may purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">out of </span>a flock consisting of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>sheep, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would not attempt to steal four-fifths of the owner’s flock. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Four </span>sheep may be purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the shepherd of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small flock</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and five </span>may be purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the shepherd of <span class="gemarra-regular">a large flock.</span>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter itself is difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One may purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">from them four or five sheep </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five fleeces </span>at a time, which indicates that purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five, yes, </span>it is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>purchasing <span class="gemarra-regular">three, no, </span>it is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">two sheep. </span>This indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that we may purchase three </span>sheep at a time.
The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>clause, which permits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sheep are <span class="gemarra-regular">robust, </span>and therefore the owner is more attentive to them and would notice if three were missing. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>clause, which prohibits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the sheep are <span class="gemarra-regular">frail. </span>Consequently, the owner does not care about them as much, and it is possible that he would not notice if only three of them went missing.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not purchase desert </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: Is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first clause, and </span>his statement is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency? Or perhaps </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the latter clause, and </span>his statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency?</span>
The Gemara elaborates: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to the first clause, and </span>his statement is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringency, as he </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: One may purchase four or five sheep from them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement applies </span>only to <span class="gemarra-regular">domesticated </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">desert </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">even four or five sheep </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be purchased? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the latter clause and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency, as he </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: But </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">two sheep, and </span>similarly, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">two fleeces, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement applies </span>only to <span class="gemarra-regular">desert </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">domesticated </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may purchase even two </span>animals.
The Gemara presents an answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to the dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them, but one may not purchase desert </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. But one may always purchase four or five sheep from them. </span>

Daf 119a

<span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he stated </span>that four or five animals may <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>be purchased, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that Rabbi Yehuda’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the latter clause, and </span>his statement is a <span class="gemarra-regular">leniency. </span>The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that Rabbi Yehuda intended his statement as a leniency.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase wood and produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from produce watchmen. </span>The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav purchased grapevine branches from a sharecropper. Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and produce from produce watchmen? </span>The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply with regard to a sharecropper, who, like a watchman, is not the owner of the produce. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This statement applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a watchman, as he has no </span>share <span class="gemarra-regular">at all in the land itself. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a sharecropper, who does have </span>a share <span class="gemarra-regular">in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: He is selling </span>merchandise <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>share of the land. Since it is plausible that the sharecropper is selling his own property, it is permitted to buy it from him.
The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> which discusses purchasing items from watchmen: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:8): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce watchmen, one may purchase </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from them when they are sitting and selling </span>the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the baskets are before them and the scales [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veturtanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are before them, </span>as in these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that they are not selling stolen merchandise. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where they said </span>to the buyer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conceal </span>your purchase, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to purchase from them, as there is good reason to suspect that the merchandise is stolen. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase from </span>a watchman <span class="gemarra-regular">from the entrance of the garden, but not from the back of the garden, </span>because if the produce is being sold inconspicuously, there is a concern that it might have been stolen.
§ Having discussed the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to suspected theft, the Gemara proceeds to examine the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to purchasing items from a known robber. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a robber, from when is it permitted to purchase </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">from him? Rav says: </span>It is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">until the majority </span>of his possessions are <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span>own property, i.e., property that he obtained legally. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says: </span>It is permitted to purchase items from a known robber <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if only <span class="gemarra-regular">a minority </span>of his possessions are from <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own property.
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda instructed Adda, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">attendant, in accordance with the statement of the one who says: </span>It is permitted to purchase items from a known robber <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if only <span class="gemarra-regular">a minority </span>of his possessions are from <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own property, i.e., in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.
With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an informer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one who informs gentiles of the whereabouts of another’s property, facilitating its theft or misuse, there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda. One says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to physically destroy it, and one says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to physically destroy it.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: The rationale of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to physically destroy it </span>is that an informer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property should not be </span>subject to a more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">than his body. </span>Since it is permitted to physically harm or even kill an informer, it would be unreasonable to prohibit the destruction of his property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the rationale of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to </span>physically <span class="gemarra-regular">destroy it </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will have good children, and it is written: The wicked may prepare it, but the just shall put it on </span>(see Job 27:17).
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda had a certain sharecropper who would weigh </span>the field’s produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>Rav Ḥisda his portion, and <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>his own portion. Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">dismissed him, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the following verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about him: </span>“A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s chil-dren; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous” </span>(Proverbs 13:22).
§ The Gemara examines various verses pertaining to robbers. <span class="gemarra-regular">“For what is the hope of the godless, though he profits, when God takes away his soul?”</span> (Job 27:8). This verse is the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda. One says </span>that the phrase “God takes away his soul” is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the soul of the robbed, and one says </span>that it is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">soul of the robber.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: The rationale of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the soul of the robbed </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof” </span>(Proverbs 1:19), which teaches that one who robs another of his property is considered as one who robbed him of his soul. And the rationale of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the soul of the robber </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them” </span>(Proverbs 22:22–23).
The Gemara questions each opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>opinion, i.e., the latter one, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it also written: “It takes away the life of the owner thereof,” </span>which indicates that the soul of the robbed is taken? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the owner thereof”? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">its current owner, </span>i.e., the robber, who has acquired the stolen item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>opinion, who said that the life of the robbed is taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it also written: “And despoil of life those that despoil them,” </span>which indicates that the soul of the robber is taken? The Gemara answers that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: What is the reason. </span>The verse teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that God <span class="gemarra-regular">will despoil </span>the life of <span class="gemarra-regular">those who despoil them? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they despoiled the soul </span>of their victims.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who robs another </span>of an item <span class="gemarra-regular">worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perut</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he takes his soul from him, as it is stated: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof” </span>(Proverbs 1:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it states: “And they shall consume your harvest, and your bread, </span>they shall consume <span class="gemarra-regular">your sons and your daughters” </span>(Jeremiah 5:17). Since they will consume the harvest and bread, it is as though they consume one’s children as well because there will be no food to feed them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it states: </span>“Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the extortion of the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land” </span>(Joel 4:19). The verse here considers extortion like the shedding of innocent blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it states </span>with regard to a famine: “And the Lord said: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites” </span>(II Samuel 21:1).
The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Yoḥanan’s point was proven by the first verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>was the purpose of adding each subsequent verse by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it states? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that the robber takes only <span class="gemarra-regular">his, </span>i.e., the victim’s, <span class="gemarra-regular">life, but the lives of his sons and daughters </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the second verse, which mentions <span class="gemarra-regular">the flesh of his sons and daughters.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: This matter applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">does not give </span>his victim <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation </span>for the stolen item, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where he gave compensation </span>for the stolen item, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>comparable to murder, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For the extortion of the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.” </span>Extortion is referring to coercing someone to sell an item that he does not want to sell. It is a form of robbery, and the verse equates it with murder.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say: This matter applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">where he committed </span>the robbery <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">action, but </span>if he committed it through <span class="gemarra-regular">indirect </span>action, the transgression is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>as severe, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.” And where did we </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">find that Saul killed the Gibeonites? </span>He did not do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, due to</span> the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">he killed </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">Nob, the city of the priests, who would provide </span>the Gibeonites with <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>(see I Samuel, chapter 22) <span class="gemarra-regular">and food, the verse ascribes him </span>blame for their death <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">killed </span>the Gibeonites himself.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may purchase </span>specific goods <span class="gemarra-regular">from women </span>in certain places. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase from women woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, but not wines, oils, and flours, </span>as these are not usually sold by women and there is a concern that perhaps the women stole them from their husbands. <span class="gemarra-regular">And no </span>items may be purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">from slaves, or from children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba Shaul says: A woman may sell </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>up to <span class="gemarra-regular">four and five dinars in order to make a cap [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kippa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her head, </span>as it is assumed that her husband allows her to sell these items in order to purchase additional articles of clothing. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">where they told </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">to conceal </span>his purchase, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to enter into the transaction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Charity collectors may take something </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>women, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not something </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a large </span>amount, as it is possible that they do not have permission to give away expensive items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">olive pressers, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purchase from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> olives in </span>a substantial <span class="gemarra-regular">measure, and oil in </span>a substantial <span class="gemarra-regular">measure, </span>as there is no concern that they would steal such a large amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not olives in a small </span>amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">oil in a small </span>amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One may purchase olives in small </span>amounts <span class="gemarra-regular">from women in the Upper Galilee, </span>where olives are exceptionally expensive, <span class="gemarra-regular">as at times, a person is embarrassed to sell </span>olives <span class="gemarra-regular">at the entrance of his house, and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives </span>some olives <span class="gemarra-regular">to his wife, and she sells </span>them. Since there is a reason to presume that the women have been given the right to sell the olives by their husbands, and it is unlikely that the women would sell them without permission, as even a small amount missing would be noticed due to their great value, it may be assumed that the olives are being sold with permission.
The Gemara relates: When <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina arrive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at Bei Meḥoza, the women of Bei Meḥoza came and tossed chains and bracelets before him </span>so that he could distribute the jewelry as charity, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he accepted </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. Rabba Tosfa’a said to Ravina: But isn’t it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Charity collectors may accept something </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>women, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not something </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large </span>amount? How can you accept jewelry, which is worth a significant sum? Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: For the residents of Meḥoza, these </span>chains and bracelets <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">something small, </span>and it is therefore permitted for me to accept them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Strands </span>of wool <span class="gemarra-regular">that the launderer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the garment <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to him, </span>as it can be assumed that the customer is uninterested in them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>strands that <span class="gemarra-regular">the carder, </span>i.e., one who prepares wool for use as a textile, <span class="gemarra-regular">removes belong to the customer, </span>as it is assumed that the customer would want them, since the carder often removes a significant number of strands. <span class="gemarra-regular">A launderer takes three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that were inserted at the edge of a garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are his, </span>but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">than this, these </span>additional threads <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to the customer. If </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">were black </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">on a white </span>garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes all of them and they are his. </span>As the removal of the threads improves the appearance of the garment, the customer does not want them.
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tailor who left </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">threa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> attached to the cloth that it could be used <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to sew with it, or </span>if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a patch </span>of cloth <span class="gemarra-regular">that is three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>fingerbreadths left from the cloth given to the tailor by the customer, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to the customer. That which a carpenter remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with an adz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belongs to him, </span>because an adze removes only small shavings of wood, which the customer is uninterested in; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>what he removes <span class="gemarra-regular">with an ax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uvakashil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belongs to the customer.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:13): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase strands </span>of wool <span class="gemarra-regular">from a launderer, because they are </span>assumed to be <span class="gemarra-regular">his.

Daf 119b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a carder <span class="gemarra-regular">should not place in </span>a piece of cloth <span class="gemarra-regular">more than three stitche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for each loop that he attaches to the cloth in order to stretch it out, as this causes the cloth to overstretch and require trimming. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he should not card the cloth </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its warp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., vertically, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its weft, </span>i.e., horizontally. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may even out </span>the cloth by cutting it along <span class="gemarra-regular">its length, but not </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its width, and if he comes to even out </span>the cloth by removing <span class="gemarra-regular">up to a handbreadth </span>of material, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him to do so.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the launderer may take <span class="gemarra-regular">two threads. But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that the launderer may take <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>threads? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which allows only two threads, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thick </span>threads, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna, which allows three threads, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to thin </span>ones.
It was also stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he should not card the cloth </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its warp but </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its weft. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits carding along the warp, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">garment, </span>which is designed for durability, and one should therefore avoid wearing out the material by carding along the warp. The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which allows one to card along the warp, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an elegant <span class="gemarra-regular">cape [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">besarbela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is made for aesthetic appearance and is therefore improved by carding in this manner.
The Gemara examines the next clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a carder <span class="gemarra-regular">should not place in </span>a cloth <span class="gemarra-regular">more than three stiches </span>for each loop. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma </span>with regard to the definition of the term stitch in this context: Does drawing the needle <span class="gemarra-regular">in and out </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>stitch, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>does drawing the needle <span class="gemarra-regular">in and out </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>stitches? The Gemara responds: The question <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
It was further stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may even out </span>the cloth by cutting it along <span class="gemarra-regular">its length, but not </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">its width. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite </span>is true? The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span>The statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which rules that one should even out the cloth along its length, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a garment, </span>where an uneven length would be conspicuous. The statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which rules that one should even it out along its width, is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a belt, </span>as the width of a belt is more noticeable than its length while it is being worn.
§ The Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses which items may be purchased from a carder. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:12): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not purchase strands </span>of thread <span class="gemarra-regular">from a carder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not his. And in a place where </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed </span>to allow carders to retain strands, the strands may be presumed <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be his </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">one may purchase </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in every place, one may purchase from them a cushion full of </span>stuffing made from <span class="gemarra-regular">strands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a mattress full of </span>stuffing made from <span class="gemarra-regular">strands. What is the reason </span>that it is permitted? The reason is that even if the carder had stolen the strands, once he uses them to make a cushion or mattress, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has acquired </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">through a change </span>of form.
§ Apropos the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> pertaining to weaving, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that discusses which items may be purchased from various craftsmen. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:11): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase from a weaver neither </span>woolen <span class="gemarra-regular">wads [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">irin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are used to hold the bobbin in place on a shuttle, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor heddles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor threads of the bobbin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">punkalin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor remnants of </span>coils of thread that were left on the <span class="gemarra-regular">spool, </span>as there is a concern that these items were taken from the customer without his consent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But one may purchase a spotted garment from them, </span>even though the design indicates that it was made from strands of different colors, which the weaver may have stolen from other garments that he was weaving. It is also permitted to purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">warp </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">and weft </span>threads from them, as well as wool that was <span class="gemarra-regular">spun </span>into thread <span class="gemarra-regular">or woven. </span>All of these items may be purchased from the weaver because they have undergone a physical change, and have therefore been acquired by the weaver even if he did steal them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say: Now </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may purchase spun </span>wool despite the fact that it has undergone only a minor physical change, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that one may purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">woven </span>wool, which has undergone a greater change of form? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it mentions <span class="gemarra-regular">woven </span>wool? It is not referring to wool woven into a garment, but to wool that was twisted into <span class="gemarra-regular">chains, </span>which is also a minor physical change.
The Gemara examines which items may be bought from a dyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may purchase from a dyer neither </span>pieces of wool used for <span class="gemarra-regular">tests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor </span>pieces used as a color <span class="gemarra-regular">sample [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dugmut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor detached </span>pieces <span class="gemarra-regular">of wool, </span>as these might have been stolen. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may purchase from him a colored garment, spun </span>threads, and <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes </span>fashioned from the aforementioned pieces of material. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may purchase spun </span>threads from the dyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that one may purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes? </span>It is obvious that one may purchase clothes, as the clothes themselves are made of spun threads. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it mentions <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">felt </span>garments, which are not made of spun thread.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:16): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives hides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a tanner, the trimmings </span>of hide <span class="gemarra-regular">and the detached </span>hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to the customer, but </span>the substance that <span class="gemarra-regular">comes up </span>while being <span class="gemarra-regular">washed in water belongs to him, </span>the tanner.
§ The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the threads <span class="gemarra-regular">were black </span>on a white garment, the launderer may take all of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>A launderer <span class="gemarra-regular">is called a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">katzra</span> in Aramaic, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he takes the short [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">katzra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>shreds of wool <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself. Rav Yehuda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: All </span>the threads, even those usually removed from the garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">are counted toward the </span>minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">number of </span>thumb-lengths between the hole through which the <span class="gemarra-regular">sky-blue wool </span>is inserted for ritual fringes and the edge of the garment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Yitzḥak, my son, is particula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about these </span>threads, and makes sure that the garment is of the proper measurement even if the threads were to be removed.
The mishna teaches: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tailor who left </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">thread </span>attached to the cloth in order to sew with it, this thread belongs to the customer. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>thread is necessary in order to be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to sew? Rav Asi said: The length of a needle outside the needle. A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Did Rav Asi mean that the thread must be <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the needle </span>there must be an additional amount of thread <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle? Or perhaps </span>he meant that it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the needle </span>there must be <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">amount </span>of additional string. In other words, was Rav Asi saying that the thread must be two needle lengths, or slightly more than one needle length?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a tailor who left the thread </span>attached to the cloth, but it was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the length necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to sew with it, or </span>if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a patch </span>of cloth <span class="gemarra-regular">that is less than three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>fingerbreadths left from the cloth given to the tailor by the customer, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is dependent upon the customer’s inclination: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the customer is particular about </span>such items, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to the customer, </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">the customer is not particular about them, these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to </span>the tailor.
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to deduce the answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that Rav Asi meant to say that the thread must be <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the needle </span>there must be an additional amount of thread <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle, </span>then the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a slightly shorter thread belongs to the customer if he wishes to keep it is reasonable, since a thread which is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than that </span>length <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span>use as the stitching of <span class="gemarra-regular">a loop. But if you say </span>that Rav Asi meant that the thread must be <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the needle </span>there must be <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount </span>of additional string, then with regard to a thread that is even <span class="gemarra-regular">less than that, </span>for what use <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>that the customer might wish to keep it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Rav Asi meant that the thread must be <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the needle </span>there must be an additional amount of thread <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to the size of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">needle, </span>so that the thread must be a total of two needle lengths. The Gemara affirms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which the carpenter </span>removes with an adze belongs to him, but what he removes with an ax belongs to the customer. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>to this ruling based upon a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which the carpenter removes with an adze and that which is severed with a saw belong to the customer. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which comes out from under a drill or under a plane [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rehitni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that which is scraped by the saw, </span>i.e., sawdust, <span class="gemarra-regular">these belong to </span>the carpenter. Whereas the mishna rules that the carpenter may keep what is removed with an adze, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rules that it belongs to the customer.
The Gemara presents an answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: In the place of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are two </span>kinds of <span class="gemarra-regular">blades </span>used by carpenters: <span class="gemarra-regular">The larger </span>blade <span class="gemarra-regular">is called an ax, and the smaller </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is called an adze. </span>By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the place of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>carpenter’s <span class="gemarra-regular">blade, and they called it an adze. </span>Consequently, the adze referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is actually an ax and the rulings are therefore congruent.
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he was doing </span>his work <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the domain of the customer, then even the sawdust belongs to the customer. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 11:18): <span class="gemarra-regular">Stone chiselers are not in </span>violation of a transgression <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery </span>if they take the leftover chips of rock. Furthermore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those who prune trees, those who prune vines, those who trim shrubs, those who weed plants, and those who hoe vegetables, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is dependent upon the owner’s inclination: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the owner is particular about </span>the plant trimmings, the workers <span class="gemarra-regular">are in </span>violation of a transgression <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery </span>if they take the trimmings, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner is not particular about them, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">belong to </span>the workers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda says: Dodder [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keshut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and green grain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veḥaziz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not subject to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery, </span>as they grow on their own and no one tends to them. But <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are particular </span>about the ownership of dodder and green grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are subject to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">robbery. Ravina said: And the city </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥasya is a city where </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">are particular </span>about dodder and green wheat.
