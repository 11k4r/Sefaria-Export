“For when the foundations are destroyed…” 
Rav Yehudah and Rav Eina, one said
‘if Hezekiah and his supporters had been destroyed then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’ 
and one said 
‘if the Temple were destroyed, then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’ 
Ulah said 
‘if the thoughts of that wicked man were not thwarted, then what would the righteous have accomplished? (Rashi: what would his award have been?)  
The verse makes sense according to the one who says it refers to the thoughts of the wicked one, that why it says “for the foundations were destroyed.”
So too according to the one who says it refers to the Temple, as it is taught, 
there was a stone there from the time of the first prophets, and it was called shetiyah. 
But according to the one who says it refers to Hezekiah and his supporters, where do we find that righteous people are called foundation? 
It is written “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and He placed the world upon them.” (Shmuel I 2:8) 
Or one can demonstrate it from here 
“He gave marvelous counsel, made great wisdom.” (Isaiah 28:29) ...
Rebbe Yochanan said, 
why is it (the Torah) called wisdom (toshia)? Because it wears out (mateshet) one’s strength. 
Another explanation: 
because it was given in secret due to the accuser. 
Another explanation: 
formless words of on which the world rests.
