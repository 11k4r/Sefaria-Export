Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  SHAMMAI RULED: 
FOR ALL WOMEN IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON] THEIR [PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM THE] TIME [OF THEIR DISCOVERING THE FLOW]. 
HILLEL RULED: 
[THEIR PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS IS TO BE RECKONED RETROSPECTIVELY] FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION, EVEN [IF THE INTERVAL EXTENDED] FOR MANY DAYS. 
THE SAGES, HOWEVER, RULED: 
[THE LAW IS] NEITHER IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OPINION OF THE FORMER NOR IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT OF THE LATTER, BUT [THE WOMEN ARE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN UNCLEAN] DURING [THE PRECEDING] TWENTY-FOUR HOURS WHEN THIS LESSENS THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION, AND DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION WHEN THIS8 LESSENS THE PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS. 
FOR ANY WOMAN WHO HAS A SETTLED PERIOD IT SUFFICES 
[TO RECKON HER PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME SHE DISCOVERS THE FLOW: AND IF A WOMAN USES TESTING-RAGS WHEN SHE HAS MARITAL INTERCOURSE, THIS IS INDEED LIKE AN EXAMINATION WHICH LESSENS EITHER THE PERIOD OF THE [PAST] TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OR THE PERIOD FROM THE [PREVIOUS] EXAMINATION TO THE [LAST] EXAMINATION. 
HOW [IS ONE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULING THAT]?  IT SUFFICES [TO RECKON HER PERIOD OF UNCLEANNESS FROM] THE TIME SHE DISCOVERS THE FLOW’? 
IF SHE WAS SITTING ON A BED AND WAS OCCUPIED WITH RITUALLY CLEAN OBJECTS AND, HAVING LEFT THEM, OBSERVED A FLOW, SHE IS RITUALLY UNCLEAN WHILE THE OBJECTS REMAIN RITUALLY CLEAN. 
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE LAID DOWN THAT 
SHE CONVEYS UNCLEANNESS FOR A PERIOD OF TWENTY-FOUR HOURS [RETROSPECTIVELY] SHE COUNTS [THE SEVEN DAYS OF HER MENSTRUATION] ONLY FROM THE TIME SHE OBSERVED THE FLOW. 
[Gemara]What is Shammai's reason? 
— He is of the opinion that 
a woman should be presumed to enjoy her usual status, and the status of the woman was one of cleanness. 
And Hillel? — When is it said that an object is presumed to possess its usual status? Only when the unfavorable condition is not internal; but as regards a woman,
