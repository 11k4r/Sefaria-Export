Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah



Daf 1a

...As we learn in the Shofar service (= tekiata) of the Rabbi, "... this day which marks the beginning of Your work, is a memorial of the first day. It is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. On this day it is decreed which countries are desteined for the sword and which for peace, which for famine and which for plenty. On this day every creature stans in judgment and is recorded for life of for death."
