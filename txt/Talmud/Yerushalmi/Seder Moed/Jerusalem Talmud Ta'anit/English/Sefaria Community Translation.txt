Daf 1b



Daf 2a

MISHNAH. WHEN DO WE [BEGIN TO] MAKE MENTION OF THE POWER OF RAIN?1 R.
ELIEZER SAYS: ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FEAST.2 R. JOSHUA SAYS: ON THE LAST
DAY OF THE FEAST. R. JOSHUA SAID TO HIM: SEEING THAT RAIN ON THE FEAST IS A
SIGN OF [GOD'S] ANGER3 WHY MAKE MENTION OF IT? THEREUPON R. ELIEZER SAID
TO HIM: I ALSO DID NOT SAY TO PRAY4 BUT TO MAKE MENTION [IN THE WORD] ‘HE
CAUSETH THE WIND TO BLOW AND THE RAIN TO FALL’5 -IN ITS DUE SEASON. HE [R.
JOSHUA] REPLIED TO HIM: IF THAT IS SO ONE SHOULD AT ALL TIMES MAKE
MENTION OF IT.
 WE PRAY FOR RAIN ONLY CLOSE TO THE RAINY SEASON. R. JUDAH SAYS: THE
LAST TO STEP BEFORE THE ARK6 ON THE LAST DAY OF THE FEAST MAKES MENTION,
THE FIRST DOES NOT; ON THE FIRST DAY OF PASSOVER THE FIRST MAKES MENTION,
THE LAST DOES NOT.
 GEMARA. What has the Tanna [in mind] when he teaches WHEN etc.?7 -The Tanna refers to [a
Mishnah] elsewhere which teaches: We make mention of the Power of Rain in the [benediction of]
the Revival of the Dead,8 and we pray for [rain] in the Benediction of the Years9 and [we insert] the
Habdulah10 in [the benediction] ‘Thou favourest man with knowledge’.11 [With that passage in
mind] the Tanna now teaches: When do we [begin] to make mention of the Power of Rain? Would it
not have been more appropriate to teach it there, why did he leave it until now? — [Say] rather,
because the Tanna had just completed [learning the Tractate] Rosh Hashanah12 where we have
learnt: And on the Feast [the world] is judged through water. And, [as there] he taught: ‘And on the
Feast [the world] is judged through water,’ therefore there he teaches: When do we [begin] to make
mention of the Power of Rain. But let him teach: When do we [begin] to make mention of Rain:
why, the Power of Rain?-R. Johanan said: Because Rain comes down by the Power [of God], as it is
said, Who doeth great things und unsearchable, marvellous things without number.13 And it is
[further] written, Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields.14 Where [in
these verses is this idea] implied? — Rabbah b. Shila replied: It is derived from the analogous use of
the word heker in verses treating of Creation. Here it is written, ‘Who doeth great things and
unsearchable’. And there it is written, ‘Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard that the everlasting
God, The Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? His discernment is
past searching out.15 And [of Creation] it is [also] written, Who by Thy strength settest fast the
mountains, Who art girded about with might.16 Whence do we know that mention of
 Rain is to be made in the Prayer?17 - It has been taught: To love the Lord your God and to serve
Him with all your heart.18 What is Service of Heart? You must needs say, Prayer. And the verse
following reads, That I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter
rain.19
 R. Johanan said: Three keys the Holy One blessed be He has retained in His own hands and not
entrusted to the hand of any messenger, namely, the Key of Rain, the Key of Childbirth, and the Key
of the Revival of the Dead. The Key of Rain, for It is written, The Lord will open unto thee His good
treasure, the heaven to give the rain of thy land in its season,20 The Key of Childbirth, for it is
written, And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened

Rabbi Yohanan wrote to Rashabal and Tani on this and that, and the Levites were standing on the stand and saying their tribute to Rashabal what they heard from Mina, since these were agreed to be the time of a song. Yesterday's poem said: "Levi Yehiorib's son, Miron, received a message from Serbian in a scathing message. Rabbi Yehuirib Ye quarreled with his sons for guarding and refusing him. Knowledge of deep birds Ye knew deep advice in their hearts and embodied to Zippurin: captured more. Rabbi Hava demanded Asherin and four Abedin (Acts 2: 2), the Lord swallowed no mercy. Yochanan demanded Ashitin. And Yochanan would permit Rabbi but by the derby Haveh thick to ruin the Temple, Hush Tamin Sabine Nahirin, and Hashem Dashin and Inin Bachin and Shatkin and Kaimin Lun. Tani R. Yehuda Ben R. Alai Baruch R. would require (Genesis 26: 29) the voice of Jacob and his hands by Esau Jacob's voice squealing from what they did by Esau in Beitar. Tani Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said: My teacher, Rabbi Akiva, would expound on the verse "A Star has risen from Jacob." When Rabbi Akiva would see Bar Kusba (Bar Kochba) he would say, 'that is the King the Messiah.' Rabbi Yochanan ben Torta said to him: Akiva! Grass will grow on your cheeks and the son of David will not yet have come! . Sir John Cole Adrianus Caesar kills eighty thousand more rebuilders. Sir John eighty thousand of a pair of fund-raisers rounded out Betar and each one was in charge of several soldiers and there was a false son and he had two hundred thousand finger tips. Send wise men and tell him until when do you make Israel my mum told them and that it allowed you to check. He was told that anyone who does not ride his horse and a landlord from Lebanon will not be written in your Isertia, he had two hundred thousand and two hundred thousand and a faded heart issued to the Lord said that Ribonia Delma And you will not go out in our armies for three years and a half, Comprehensive Edrinus did more. And this is the conscious Rabbi Elazar sitting on the sack and on the ashes and praying every day and telling the world ruler Do not sit in judgment today Do not sit in judgment today in Ara Adrienus Mizel Lia.
