MISHNA. On the sixth (special blessing added for a fast) he says ‘He who answered Yonah in the belly of the fish, may He answer you and hear the voice of your cries on this day. Blessed are You, oh Lord, who answers in the time of distress.’ 
On the seventh he says ‘He who answered David and Shlomo his son in Jerusalem, may He answer you and hear the voice of your cries on this day. Blessed are You, oh Lord, who has mercy on the land.’
GEMARA. It is written “And he said: I called out from my distress to the Lord, and He answered me…” (Yonah 2:3) There was no need for David and Shlomo and afterwards Yonah and Eliyahu, except to end with ‘who has mercy on the land.’ On the seventh: They said in the name of Sumchus ‘blessed is He who brings low the lofty.’ This makes sense regarding Shlomo, of whom it is written “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Melachim I 8:13) but why David? Because he attempted to count Israel. R’ Abahu said: it is written “When I call, answer me, O God of my righteousness; in my distress You have relieved me…” (Tehillim 4:2) David said before the Holy One ‘Master of the World! Every distress into which I came, You opened it out for me. I entered into the distress of Bat Sheva, You brought me Shlomo. I entered into the distress of counting Israel, You brought me the Holy Temple.
