Gemara. Like Yehoyariv and his acquaintances. And they would sleep in the synagogue. R’ Chalifta ben Shaul taught: because of the matters of tent impurity. On the way they would say “I rejoiced when they said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the Lord.’” (Psalms 122:1) In Jerusalem they would say “Our feet were standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.” (Psalms 122:2) On the Temple Mount they would say “Hallelujah! Praise God in His holy place…” (Psalms 150:1) In the Courtyard they would say “Let every soul praise God. Hallelujah!” (Psalms 150:6)
