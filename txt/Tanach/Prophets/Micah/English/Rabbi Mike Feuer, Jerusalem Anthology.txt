Micah

Chapter 1





All this is because of the transgression of Jacob, and because of the sins of the house of Israel. Who is [the cause of] the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Samaria? And who [is the cause of] the high places of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?



For she is mortally ill [from] her wounds, for it has come up to Judah; it has reached the gate of My people up to Jerusalem.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3












Therefore, because of you, Zion shall be plowed as a field; Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the Temple Mount like the high places of a forest.
