Esther

Chapter 1

In the days of Ahasuerus he was in charge of 127 provinces
In those days when Ahasuerus sat on his throne
In the third year he made a massive feast
Shows off his wealth for 180 days
Second party is for everyone in Shushan for seven days
A lot of bling
Drank from gold cups and other different types of cups. There was a lot of wine.
No peer pressure, drink what you want
Vashti made a seven day party
On the seventh day when Ahasuerus was wasted he called his seven advisors
To bring Vashti with her crown to show off how beautiful she was
Vashti says, "No chance!" Ahasuerus became (not just mad) but super mad.
Huddle up with advisors
List of seven advisors
How to deal with Vashti
She's not just messing with you she's messing with all men
If Vashti can diss you, who knows what's next?
Everyone will laugh at you
Replace Vashti with another queen
All women should respect their husbands
Ahasuerus, "Sick idea"
The decree is: Husband is in charge, wife has to speak his language.
