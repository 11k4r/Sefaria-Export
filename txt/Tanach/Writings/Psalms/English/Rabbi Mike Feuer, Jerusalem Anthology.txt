Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I will throw my lock; Philistia, join me. 
Who will bring me to a fortified city?-He Who led me to Edom? 
Is it not You, O God, Who has forsaken us, and [Who] does not go forth, O God, with our hosts? 
Give us aid against the adversary, but the salvation of man is futile. 
Through God we shall gather might, and He will trample our adversaries. (yevus tsareinu)
