<b>withhold</b> this is the language of deduction. As it comes in Pesachim 118a "The Holy Blessed One does not withhold reward from any creature". And in the whole Talmud [...]. And so the explanation is, withheld the creatures from the urge to evil and from evil deeds, and brought them under the wings of the Divine Presence.





<b>You have bound yourself</b> that in the world to come, that you begot a <i>mamzer</i>. That this is from sin that it is not possible to mend, as it comes in Chagiga 9b.
<b>That a <i>mamzer</i> does not enter Jerusalem</b>. Even though it says at the end of Tractate Horayot (Horayot 3:8) that a learned <i>mamzer</i> precedes an ignoramus high priest. As it says (Proverbs 3:15) "She [wisdom] is more precious than rubies", from a high priest who enters within and beyond. Nonetheless, the holiness of Jerusalem is unable to bear him, since its holiness is very great -- one who does not have proper lineage, such as a <i>mamzer</i>, would not be able to have settlement in Jerusalem. And so it is written "And a <i>mamzer</i> shall dwell in Ashdod, etc." (Zechariah 9:6). Commentated.
