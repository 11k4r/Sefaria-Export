Megillat Taanit

Nisan



Iyar



Sivan



Tammuz


<i>The Tzaddukim had a book of laws - "These are stoned, these are burned, these are killed by sword, these are stangled."  When it was written, a person would ask (what to do) and go look in the book.  If you asked them, "How do you know this one is stoned or burned or decapitated or strangled?", they wouldn't be able to bring a proof from the "the instructions given to you" (Devarim 17:11).  Because we don't write laws in a book. ... The day that it was destroyed, they made a holiday.</i>
