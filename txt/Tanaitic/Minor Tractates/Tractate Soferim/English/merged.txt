(And afterwards one lifts the Torah and says softly "One is our God, Great is our Master, His Name is Holy and Awesome Forever," and the people respond and say "YHWH is God, YHWH is His Name." Then you go back and say both parts again). 
Immediately one unwraps the Torah for 3 columns worth and lifts it and displays the writing within for the people who are standing to his right and to his left, and then he turns it in front of him and behind him since the commandment is that all men and women see the written text and bow before it and say "And this is the Torah that God placed with Moses before the people of Israel" (Deuteronomy 4:14) (or) "God's Torah is perfect, renewing life" (Psalms 19:8). And the one reading the Maftir (additional section from the Prophets) gives the Torah back to the Cantor of the assembled and he returns the Torah in order to cover it with the heads/crowns of the guests/readers, since it is not respectful for the Torah to be by itself...
