Aderet Eliyahu

Introduction



Genesis



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3

[...] "from all His work that God created to do/make." The explanation of this is that "to do/make" refers to the future. That is that the Holy-One-blessed-be-He renews every day anew the work of creation. And the renewal of the work of creation on the Sabbath day is prepared on the day before and on the Sabbath He refrains from that too; and that is the meaning of what is said "from all."

Verse 22

"And the sister of Tuval-Cain was Naamah." She was known in the days of Moshe our teacher and the Israelites, and thus it says (Genesis 36:22) "And the sister of Lotan was Timna," because she was famous. Know that all of these were wiped out and turned into demons, and were well-known, and it is not my desire to discuss this at length, therefore I am writing here.
