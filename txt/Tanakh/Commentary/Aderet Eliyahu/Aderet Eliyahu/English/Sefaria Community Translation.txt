"And the sister of Tuval-Cain was Naamah." She was known in the days of Moshe our teacher and the Israelites, and thus it says (Genesis 36:22) "And the sister of Lotan was Timna," because she was famous. Know that all of these were wiped out and turned into demons, and were well-known, and it is not my desire to discuss this at length, therefore I am writing here.
