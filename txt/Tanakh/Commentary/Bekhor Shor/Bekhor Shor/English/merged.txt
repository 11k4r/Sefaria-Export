Verse 8

“God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son” – meaning: “You, my son [will be the lamb for the burnt-offering. We know that Abraham] spoke of this concept to him from two inferences of what he said to him. The first is a logical inference as he says “My son, God will provide Himself the lamb...” (implying that the son is a substitute for the lamb). [The second proof is that] our Rabbis say (Bereishit Rabbah 56:4) that although Isaac understood, “they went both of them together” - i.e. with equal intentions to fulfil the will of the Creator.
