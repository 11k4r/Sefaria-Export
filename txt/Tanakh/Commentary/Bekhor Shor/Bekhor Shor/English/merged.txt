"And it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you". A symbol and a sign that I am the Master and you are my servants, and the sign is sealed in a private place that will not be seen. The reason for this is so that the (non-Jewish) nations of the world won't say that the Jews are blemished ("ba'alei mumin"). And since the Holy One, Blessed be He, commanded men and not women, we learn that the place of manhod ("makom zachrut") was where God commanded to seal the covenant. And the blood of niddah that women guard, and tell their openings to their husbands, this is to them the blood of the covenant ("dam brit").

“God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son” – meaning: “You, my son [will be the lamb for the burnt-offering. We know that Abraham] spoke of this concept to him from two inferences of what he said to him. The first is a logical inference as he says “My son, God will provide Himself the lamb...” (implying that the son is a substitute for the lamb). [The second proof is that] our Rabbis say (Bereishit Rabbah 56:4) that although Isaac understood, “they went both of them together” - i.e. with equal intentions to fulfil the will of the Creator.

Verse 1

"And when a person brings a grain-offering". All grain-offerings are holy of holies and a non-priest (zar) may not eat of them. And since it is the way of poor people to bring grain-offerings, it pleased the Holy Blessed One to make them (the grain-offerings) holy of holies. [This is] to show Their humility (of the Holy Blessed One), since They are a great monarch (melech gadol) and love the poor.

Verse 39


"And you shall see it [the tzitzit] and remember". That it was only made for recollection, and when you see it the mitzvah recalls and reminds you of the rest of the mitzvot. Because tzitzit are like a seal on the clothes that are made for a servant, a sign that he is serving his master. And when they see Israel remembers that they are servants to God and that it is incumbent upon them to perform all God's commandments. And the value of tzitzit is 600 in gematria, and there are eight threads and five knots [per fringe] -- behold, this is 613 like the 613 commandments. And when one sees it [the fringe], it reminds one of all the commandments, and gives God a symbol to signify that they are God's servants, and a sign on their clothing and a sign [on] their houses and they are called a "seal" on it, and tefillin on their heads and arms to signify that they are servants. For the four signs surround a person: brit milah in front of them, a mezuzah at their right, tefillin on their left, tzitzit on their clothing that are dragged on their clothing behind them as they walk.
