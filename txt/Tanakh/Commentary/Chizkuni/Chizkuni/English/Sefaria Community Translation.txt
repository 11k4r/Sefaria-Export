תוצא הארץ, “let the earth bring forth;” The expression תוצא seems to imply that these creations already existed (and just needed to sprout forth from the ground).

אשר שם הזהב  The word: חוילה, occurs in the Torah twice more, once in Genesis 10,7, and once in verse 29 of that chapter. Therefore the Torah wished to indicate that the gold mentioned here is that which used to be brought from Ophir.

את הארץ, the word את, at the end of the verse, includes all the previously not spelled out creatures on earth. An example of such indirect references is: Exodus 19,5: כי לי כל הארץ, “for the entire earth is Mine,” where the word כל substitutes for: “all the creatures on.”

ותהיא נציב מלח, “she was turned into a pillar of salt;” her punishment fitted her crime, as Rashi has explained. Rashi claims that when her husband asked his wife to give some salt to his guests so that their food would taste better, she absolutely refused by challenging his right to violate the laws of Sodom concerning the entertaining of any guests. (based on B’reshit Rabbah,50,4) *Alternatively, "his wife gazed behind him and it became... - "it" referring to the entire land becoming filled with salt as it says "all its soil devastated by sulfur and salt." (Deuteronomy 29:22)

וראיתן על האבנים , you are to closely inspect the birth stools. Pharaoh gave the midwives a sign how to recognise if the approaching birth would be that of a male baby or a female. If a male, the face would be turned downwards and if a female the baby’s face would be looking upwards, as each would do during marital intercourse. [This editor finds it hard to believe that professional midwives needed instruction on this subject from Pharaoh. Ed.]
אם בן הוא והמיתן אותו, “if it is a son, you are to kill him;“ when the Egyptians realised that they could not prevent the Israelites from continuing to increase at an alarming rate, they decided to at least kill their males who might grow up and fight them.
ואם בת היא וחיה, “but if it is a daughter, let her live;” women are not in the habit of fighting during a war. They therefore did not need to be afraid of them.

!התפאר עלי למתי, אעתיר, “have this boast over me about when you will release the Children of Israel, and I will pray for the frogs to disappear immediately!”
לעמך, “and for your people;” the letter מ in this word has the semi vowel sheva. Logic tells us that this plague did not last one quarter of a month. If you were to say that the conversation between Moses and Pharaoh took place on the sixth day of this plague, it does not make much sense, as the plague would have come to an end on the following day anyways without Moses praying for its removal.

(1) "Say to the priests” - After [the Torah had] warned the Israelites to become holy [19:2], it warns the priests to protect themselves from ritual impurity, given that they are dedicated to God’s service and are considered the members of G-d’s “household” on earth.

The Children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan, meaning do not say Aaron died at the Golden Calf affair at the beginning of the forty years and my[Moses] prayer didn't help him, because ultimately [as the pasuk shows us] Aaron died at the end of the forty years at Mount Hor at the same time as The Children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan after arriving there from Moserah.

The condition for entering is that you have a record of keeping the laws of the Torah.

 תכין לך הדרך, “prepare the way for yourself;” the route to such cities of refuge should not be a narrow path, etc., but a road that is easy to travel, and has been marked clearly. Rabbi Avin, son of Rabbi Yaakov, is quoted in a Midrash on Psalms 25,10 describing how every mile or so, there were markers how to get to these cities, and in every kiosk, there were directional signals identifying the route. [The purpose was not only for the killer to know how to get to such cities, but to remind the people at large to be careful never to become guilty of killing through negligence. Ed.] This was hinted at two verses earlier in the same chapter of Psalms.
ושלשת את גבול ארצך, “so that you will effectively divide the borders of your country into three segments;” how did this work out in practice? The Land of Israel was 400 miles long (from south to north) It was about 100 miles from Chevron to Sh’chem, and from there to Kadesh another 100 miles. The three cities of refuge therefore symbolically divided the land into three sections. You will note that the center section therefore was shorter than the northern and southern section respectively. This is accounted for in the minds of the sages by the fact that both Chevron and Sh’chem were cities in which a lot of bloodshed occurred. They quote a verse in Hosea 6,9, as supporting their interpretation.
כל רוצח, “every murderer, regardless of intentional or unintentional.” We explained this already on Numbers 35,14.
