Introduction



Genesis



Chapter 1



Verse 1



<b>Elohim.</b> According to Rashi this Name signifies lordship and greatness; according to the Rambam, judgment; according to the Ibn Ezra, kingship; according to the Seforno, eternality. It is in the plural, says the Seforno, to indicate that He is the ultimate eternal form from which all others derive. According to the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>) and the <i>Beis Yosef</i> it signifies strength and domination. To the Ralbag it indicates that all things emanate from and are governed by Him. The Vilna Gaon agrees that it indicates governance, which is why it can be applied to lesser governing beings as well.

Verse 27



<b>Male (<i>zachar</i>) and female (<i>nekeivah</i>).</b> The word <i>zachar</i> derives from the same root as <i>zeicher</i> — “remembrance.” A male descendant inherits his father’s wealth and continues his estate, thereby preserving his memory. <i>Nekeivah</i> comes from a root meaning “distinction” (see <i>Bamidbar</i> 1:17), reflecting the fact that female offspring separate from their ancestral homes.

<b>The breath (or “soul”) of life.</b> <i>Chayim</i> — “life” — is in the plural to indicate that the soul possesses numerous faculties, such as growth, sensation and intellect. Alternatively, it indicates that the soul lives forever. 
<b>A living soul.</b> This alludes to the unique human capacity for free choice. The word <i>nefesh</i> — “soul” — indicates desire, as in <i>Devarim</i> 21:14. The implication is that only human beings were created to exercise their free will.

Verse 2


<b>A shepherd.</b> A profession that neither preoccupies the mind nor wearies the body, thus it is ideal for those who wish to engage in contemplation. In fact, some say that Hevel was punished for going too far in his metaphysical speculations.

Verse 13

<b>Please say that you are my sister.</b> That is, resolve in your heart that we are no longer married. Before the Torah was given this was sufficient to effect a divorce, hence he was not asking her to lie. Although Avraham observed the entire Torah, in this case he conducted himself according to Noachide law to save his life.

Verse 13

<b>When Elokim caused me to wander.</b> <i>Elohim</i> here refers to the pagan gods. Thus the verse should actually be rendered, “When the gods of my father’s house caused me to wander” — that is, when he left home to proclaim the true faith throughout the world.

Verse 2

<b>To eulogize … and to weep.</b> In general one weeps over the termination of the life of the deceased before eulogizing the loss to the living. For the righteous, however, death is not a tragedy because they are then able to attain greater heights. Thus it is only the loss to the living that is a cause for weeping.

Alternatively, their lineage would be traced to the Patriarchs despite their mother’s descent from Shechem; see 41:45 in the name of <i>Tosafos</i>.
