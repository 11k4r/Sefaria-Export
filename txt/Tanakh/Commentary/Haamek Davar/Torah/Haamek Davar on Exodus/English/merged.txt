<b>And Pharaoh charged (vayitsav):</b> It is written, vayitsav, here, which is an expression of exhortation. And it is explained at the beginning of Parshat Tsav (Leviticus 6:2) that exhortation is whatever is required to be diligent about a matter so that it will be done in its totality. And [it was] since this decree was not similar to the prohibition to the midwives - as there it was easy to fulfill the decree, since it is impossible to give birth without a midwife; which was not the case with this prohibition. For it was possible to hide it from him, as they told him that the Israelite women were vigorous and [able] to give birth without a midwife. And those appointed over it could have also dealt with it weakly and said that they did not know about this boy. For this reason Pharaoh [decreed it] with an exhortation, that they diligent about the matter, so as to fulfill the decree in its totality.

<b>and every daughter:</b> Whether they were already born or whether they be born from now, let them live - [meaning,] make efforts to keep them alive. And his intention with this was that since the daughters would be so more numerous than the males, they would per force marry Egyptians. And he saw to deal well with his land through this; as the Israelite women were vigorous, and he reasoned that this is what caused the proliferation of the people of Israel. So if they would marry Egyptians, they too would proliferate and increase.

Verse 22

<b>Yisrael is My son, My firstborn.</b> All the nations of the world are part of the purpose of creation. Even if they practice idolatry, nevertheless, there are pious gentiles in every generation who recognize the honor of Hashem. However, Yisrael is compared to the first born son of a king that inherits the crown; moreover, even during the lifetime of the king he assists in ruling the kingdom. In the same way, Yisrael assists Divine Providence and the running of the world.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6



Verse 1



Verse 2



<b>I am Adonoy.</b> This teaches that the entire world is perpetuated by Hashem, utilizing Divine Providence. In contradistinction to a house, for example, that once it has been built the builder ceases work and it stands on its own, the world continues to exist only because Hashem keeps it in existence. With this, Hashem answered Moshe’s question in which he implied that Pharaoh’s decree was merely a result of natural events without Hashem’s Providence; Hashem replied that nature is also a result of Divine Providence.

Verse 3



Verse 4


<b>The land of their sojourning.</b> I promised them the Land because it is the land of their sojourning and they have become accustomed to Divine Providence in it, and not solely because it is a land of milk and honey. Hashem looks after the Land in detail, making it the place of abundant Providence. I promised this to their sons, for it is My Will to watch over them.

<b>This is [the lineage of] Aharon and Moshe.</b> According to the simple meaning, [Aharon appears in the verse before Moshe because] the B’nei Yisrael had more respect for Aharon than Moshe, for they never knew the greatness of Moshe, who was raised in the royal palace and fled to Midian, but they knew of Aharon’s holiness.

Verse 27

<b>These are Moshe and Aharon.</b> In Pharaoh’s view Moshe was the greater one, for he already knew of his reputation and his wisdom, but Aharon was unknown to him.

<b>And there were lice.</b> The Torah repeats these words (from v.13) to inform that they settled on the bodies of people and animals and bit them in the manner of lice, which do not swarm but are attached to the body. This is implied by the Midrash Tanchuma: “They entered the Egyptians’ bodies like arrows”.

<b>What is this service.</b> The Pesach sacrifice is singled out for the scoffer’s derision because it serves no practical purpose, unlike other sacrifices which at least serve as appeasement or atonement. And if it is to serve as an expression of gratitude for the redemption it should not have been made to coincide specifically with the striking of the first born, for in no other instance are we commanded to commemorate miracles. The only exceptions are the festivals of Chanukah and Purim and even in those cases the intention of the Sages was to call to mind the deeper concepts connected with the miracles, not the miracles themselves.

<b>At (or “above”) Pi haChiros.</b> The B’nei Yisrael camped <i>before</i> Pi haChiros (v. 2) while the Egyptians camped <i>above</i> Pi haChiros.

<i>Thin uncovered matter, thin like frost:</i> It is fitting to know that one should wonder about the picking up of the manna - as there descended an <i>omer</i> quantity for an adult and [also] an <i>omer</i> for a child of three - how is it possible that their eating would be the same? And if we say that this too is miraculous, that the child should eat like the adult - if so, how does the bareita in Eruvin 83b prove that the measurement of a meal is an <i>omer</i> - and is it not that here it was not like the way of eating other things? And also there is an objection [from] the expression later, "a man according to his eating" - which implies that according to his ability did it descend, [according to] how [much] he needed, if it were little or much; and [yet] behold, the same [amount] descended for everyone. But rather the answer for all of this is that the manna 'was like a <i>gad</i> seed' - which is a flax seed - the crust of which is above, and within it, it is full of granules. And like this did the manna descend, but some of them were empty and only the very thin upper crust was eaten. And this is what was said, "thin uncovered matter (<i>mechuspas</i>)" - that the thin crust was like a box and like the expression, "<i>chafisa</i> (small container)," like the explanation of Rashi. And some of them are "thin like frost," which is empty inside and it is possible to make with much frost one handful. And it was through providence that there descended for each one according to his eating; and [so] for the child they were completely empty. Yet according to the size of the picking, there was an <i>omer</i> for everyone. And [so] it [comes out] fine that the gemara proves [the amount of a meal] from that the measurement was an <i>omer</i>, and [even] for the most, there was only this measurement; we understand from this that this was the measurement required for an average man [for a meal].

One to another. This is to teach regarding strong love, like the groom when he sees the bride, and enjoys just looking at her.
Toward the ark-cover. To teach us that the vision of the Holy One and Israel, together, is toward the Torah in the ark, and this is what explains [the saying that] the Holy One, and Israel, and the Torah are one, as it is known.

Chapter 26



Chapter 27



Chapter 28



Verse 1


<b>And his sons with him.</b> The expression “with him” implies that they only merited the priesthood through being Aharon’s sons. This was the error of Nadav and Avihu when they offered the strange fire before God (Vayikra 10:1)—they thought they were worthy of performing the service on account of their own personal greatness.

Verse 2

<b>For honor and splendor.</b> This is only said about the garments of the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>. Aharon was required to act with special piety and to set himself apart from the people, which was liable to bring upon him an accusation of haughtiness. Therefore it was necessary that he be distinguished in his dress so that all would know that God had chosen him to be the “Throne” of the <i>Shechinah</i>.

Verse 3


<b>Wise in heart.</b> Wisdom is usually associated with the head. “Wise in heart” refers specifically to the possession of awe of God, which is the beginning of true wisdom (Tehillim 111:10). The seat of awe is indeed in the heart.

<b>As a remembrance.</b> In Tehillim (115:12) it is written, “Ad-noy has remembered us; He will bless.” This teaches us that when God “remembers” the B’nei Yisrael it is in order to bless them.

<b>Linen pants.</b> These pants were of lesser sanctity than the other garments. The other garments imparted holiness to the wearer; the pants merely concealed their private parts. The <i>kohanim</i> were dressed for the first time in their other garments by Moshe; the pants they donned themselves. The other garments were donned in the courtyard; the pants were put on outside the Holy Temple.

<b>See, I have called.</b> “See” in this context is a call to caution. The fact that the <i>mishkon</i> could only be fashioned by one whom God had imbued with Divine spirit, wisdom, understanding and knowledge, was an indication of its loftiness. Therefore it was fitting for them to behave towards it with special care.

Verse 5



Verse 6

 I have also granted skill to all who are skillful: In Brachot 55 they (the sages) said that the Holy One Blessed be God only gave wisdom to those who had wisdom. (The Gemara asks) What is the basis for this? And thus the explanation is given that it is from Sefer Daniel (2:21) " “He gives wisdom unto the wise..." And the intention in this is that the root of wisdom is explained by two teachings/manners:1) logic and discernment 2) Learning and researching what others have already learned. And this is the explanation of the verse in Proverbs (4:7) The beginning of wisdom is—acquire wisdom; With all your acquisitions, acquire discernment. First comes the logical reasoning of the human as he behaves with learning - that he must first gain wisdom of others and afterwards he will be able to acquire wisdom learning one thing from another on his own intuition. ...

"And God had mercy" - from performing the total annihilation.

And regarding this decree Moshe prayed for forty more days, as explained later with the help of Heaven.

<b>Whoever is for Ad-noy [come] to me.</b> Moshe could not have been referring to everyone who did not worship the calf, for that would have included the majority of the people. Rather, he was calling upon those whose intentions were pure and who would give all they owned for God’s honor.

Verse 27



Verse 28



Verse 29



Verse 30


<b>You have committed a great sin (<i>cheit</i>).</b> A <i>cheit</i> is an inadvertent sin. Moshe rebuked them no further concerning their idolatry and rebellion because three thousand of them had already been executed and many more died after drinking the water mixed with the dust of the calf. Instead he chastised them only for the unintended offense of desecrating the name of Heaven.
<b>Now I will go up to Ad-noy.</b> Moshe knew that the <i>Shechinah</i> was still present on the mountaintop because it was still burning with fire. Therefore he realized that that would be the best place to pray since the Tent of Meeting had not yet been established (see v. 33:7).

<b>They mourned.</b> Even though a child does not wish to listen to his mother’s admonishments, the moment she attempts to leave him he begins to cry. He is willing to endure even chastisement if she will only continue to watch out for him. Similarly, although the B’nei Yisrael were punished many times in the desert, they were dismayed when God threatened to take His <i>Shechinah</i> away.  
<b>And no man wore his ornaments.</b> All who were worthy of receiving the spirit of prophecy realized that this was not the time to seek it.
