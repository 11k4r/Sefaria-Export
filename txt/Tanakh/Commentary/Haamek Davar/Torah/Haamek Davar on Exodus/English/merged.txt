Verse 14

<i>Thin uncovered matter, thin like frost:</i> It is fitting to know that one should wonder about the picking up of the manna - as there descended an <i>omer</i> quantity for an adult and [also] an <i>omer</i> for a child of three - how is it possible that their eating would be the same? And if we say that this too is miraculous, that the child should eat like the adult - if so, how does the bareita in Eruvin 83b prove that the measurement of a meal is an <i>omer</i> - and is it not that here it was not like the way of eating other things? And also there is an objection [from] the expression later, "a man according to his eating" - which implies that according to his ability did it descend, [according to] how [much] he needed, if it were little or much; and [yet] behold, the same [amount] descended for everyone. But rather the answer for all of this is that the manna 'was like a <i>gad</i> seed' - which is a flax seed - the crust of which is above, and within it, it is full of granules. And like this did the manna descend, but some of them were empty and only the very thin upper crust was eaten. And this is what was said, "thin uncovered matter (<i>mechuspas</i>)" - that the thin crust was like a box and like the expression, "<i>chafisa</i> (small container)," like the explanation of Rashi. And some of them are "thin like frost," which is empty inside and it is possible to make with much frost one handful. And it was through providence that there descended for each one according to his eating; and [so] for the child they were completely empty. Yet according to the size of the picking, there was an <i>omer</i> for everyone. And [so] it [comes out] fine that the gemara proves [the amount of a meal] from that the measurement was an <i>omer</i>, and [even] for the most, there was only this measurement; we understand from this that this was the measurement required for an average man [for a meal].
