"So that they should know, etc." (Lev 23:43) In order that they will not despair from the good life since they do not have a holding of the inheritance or natural happiness. In any case, "they would know" from the mitzvah of Sukkah that it was given [to them] to remember their dwelling in Sukkot when [God] brought them out [of Egypt] (cf Lev 23:43)... And behold, "I am the Lord Your God" (Lev 23:43): Your Leader and Protector forever and there is nothing blocking from the One who is Blessed to bestow goodness and blessing even from those who don't hold an inheritance. And it is also important to understand the language of "the citizen."
