"May God bless you." Included in this is whatever is appropriate for each person to be blessed with. As is written in Deuteronomy 16:16: "they shall not appear before the LORD empty...according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which He hath given thee." The blessing will be according to the blessing that he was blessed with until then: For one who deals in Torah, in his study. For one who deals in commerce, in his merchandise. Thus is included in this general blessing "May God bless you" an additional blessing for each person about what he has.
"And protect you." For every blessing requires protection so that it does not become an obstacle, God forbid. A master of Torah needs protection from pride, desecration of God's name and the like. And similarly, that he not forget his learning. A property owner needs protection that his wealth not be to his detriment, like Korach and Navot the Jezreelite and the like. And similarly, protection from theft and loss. And likewise for everything that is in need of blessing, protection from whatever causes trouble is requested.

Verse 1

According to the simple meaning of the text, a gentile black woman. But who had converted. And Aaron and Miriam thought that this was why Moshe separated himself from her. That his wife was not of Israelite lineage. And they were saying that under no circumstances is this proper. After he had taken her and knew she was a non-Israelite and she didn't deceive him. Therefore it's not fair to make her sad and separate himself from her. [Afterwards I saw this commentary in the book "Paanekh Razei" who as his custom explains כושית as being black.

This example shows that God can see all of the world just as Moshe sees. And if he knows, he knew what they said about him. They did not find it in their hearts to tell him [directly] to his face. And because of this God rebuked that also now, it was as if they had spoken to his face.

<b>One law and one ordinance:</b> The teachings that the sages of each generation add are called "law" ("<i>Torah</i>"). And a commandment matter which is not explicit in the Torah is a just "<b>ordinance</b>" based on the intellect. On all of this is written "<b>shall be both for you, and for the stranger ...</b>" - it will be equal, without distinction. <b>And see that</b> Scripture calls commandments that are explicit in the Torah "statute." Ans this is as I wrote on Exodus 18:16 - all of the commandments that are explicit in the Torah, even if they do have a reason. In any case, even where the reason is missing, the commandment stands its ground. If the details of the commandment are without reason, and are only "statute." For once they are explicit in the Torah, they are statutes which the Heavens and the Earth stand upon, as I wrote on Leviticus, at the beginning of the "<i>Bechukotai</i>" ("In My statutes") portion. However, the teachings of the sages of the generation go along with the reasoning, so as soon as the reason changes, the rule changes. Therefore, Scripture calls them "law and ordinance."
