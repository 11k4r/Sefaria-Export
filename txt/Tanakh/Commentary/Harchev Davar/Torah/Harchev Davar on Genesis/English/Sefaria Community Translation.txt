And for this purpose, the nation of Israel was formed as it says in the prophet Isaiah,"I created you and appointed you a covenant people, a light of nations." And the meaning of "A covenant people" is to repair all of the nations with faithfulness which is called "covenant". And this is like what is written in the book of Shemot (31:16) and in several places. "A light of nations" through your manner. And this is the purpose of creation as God said to Joshua, "In order that all the nations of the world will  know the hand of God, for it is strong, in order that you will fear God your God for all time."(Joshua 4:24). The desire for all of the nations is only that they will know the hand of God and not like the purpose of the selections of Israel that they will also fear God for all time. And for this end, the beginning was at the time of Joshua when they were commanded to  write the Written Torah on the stones in seventy languages. And it is written with regard to the stones, "On this day you have become a nation,"(Devarim 27:9) as we explained in its place .  And afterwards the great dispersion of Israel among the nations came for this purpose as we will explain there as well with the help of God. However, from the very beginning God warded Abraham our father, the head of the chosen nation. And the power of every nation lies in its roots...

...And it appears from what we've seen that Ya'akov is compared to his seed as a sign of the way the way their world would develop. And if so, we can also say that just as Ya'akov ascended from Egypt, the place of his exile to the Land of Israel with great honor, so too shall Israel go out from the lands of their captivity in the days of the Messiah...And the principle reason that most of our lives are in exile, I already explained in Parashat Lech (Bereshit 17:6) that the Holy Blessed One revealed to Abraham our father that his children were created to be a light to the nations. And this is possible only when they are dispersed in exile. And thus Ya'akov our father, when he came to Egypt, for this was then his principle settlement there, the God's blessed name became very great when they saw how he cared for Ya'akov and his seed.
