And the explanation of "AND HE HEARD": That he alone heard The Voice and it was not heard by anybody else who was in the Tent of Gathering outside of the curtain. This is also correct because Hashem added to his (Moses's) feeling in his ears (ability to hear) just as He had added light to the eyes of the blind Elisha and thus likewise revealed to the eyes of Bilam
<b>Being spoken.</b> This was always the way Hashem spoke to him.

Verse 39

<b>And it will be to you for fringes.</b> Anyone who has a garment with four corners is commanded to always wear it during the day, and not take it off, so that he shall remember. Those that pray with a tallis [only] during the time of prayer do so because of the verses they read during the Shema: “Make for themselves, <i>tzitzis</i>-fringes” and “And it will be to you for fringes.” In my view, however, one has a greater obligation to wear <i>tzitzis</i> at other times than prayer, so that he will remember and not err, and not commit a transgression at any time. During prayer, however, he will likely not transgress. 
<b>And you will look upon it.</b> It is a commandment for the <i>tzitzis</i> to be seen.
<b>After [the desire of] your hearts.</b> The eye sees and the heart desires. The <i>tzitzis</i> are a sign that a person should not chase after his desirous thoughts and anything his eyes seek.
<b>Which cause you to go astray.</b> Someone who follows after his desires is straying from the service of his God.

Verse 40

<b>In order that you will remember.</b> It already said, “And you will remember all of Hashem’s commandments.” This teaches that if you will remember you will be holy, and you will not become defiled by the heart’s desires, which pollute the intellect.

Chapter 16



Verse 1

“And Korah took” - This matter that was in the wilderness of Sinai, when the firstborns were replaced and the Levites were separated,<br>For the Israelites thought that Moshe our Leader did it according to his own thought, to give greatness to his brother, and also to the sons of Kehat for they are close to him, and all of the Levites that they are his family.<br>And the Levites conspired against him because they were given to Aaron and his sons.<br>Datan and Aviram conspired because the firstborn privilege was removed from Reuven their father and given to Yosef; perhaps they suspected that [Moshe did that] for the sake of Yehoshua his servant [who was from Yosef].<br>Also Korah was a first born, for thus was written.<br>&gt;And those Heads of the Congregation (edah) were firstborns and they were bringing the olah offerings.<br>And the proof for this explanation is the miracle of the staff (Bamidbar 17:16-26) that all of Israel saw that Hashem chose the tribe of Levi in place of the firstborns, and therefore it is written (Bamidbar 17:25) “their mutterings ceased,” for the mutterings were about this.<br>Also Moshe said that “it is not from my own mind” (Bamidbar 26:28), because they suspected that it was from his own mind that he did it.<br>And further proof is “Hashem did not send me” - for this task - because all the Israelites already believed in him [in general]. Another total proof is “all the congregation are holy” and this is a hint to the firstborns that they are holy, because it is written (shemot 13:2) “sanctify to Me every first born” and they are the priests (Kohanim) that approach Hashem and they are the essence of the whole congregation.  

Verse 2



Verse 3

<b>You have [taken] too much for yourselves.</b> This is similar to די לכם — it is enough for you, i.e., you have seized the larger portion.  
<b>Since the entire congregation are all holy.</b> From the day of standing at Mount Sinai, the entire congregation became holy. 
<b>And Adonoy is in their midst.</b> The Levites were chosen after Hashem’s honor was in the midst of Bnei Yisroel. And even if Moshe knew that the tribe of Levi would be chosen when he was at Mount Sinai, he never told the Bnei Yisroel.  
<b>Why do you raise yourselves</b> — for Aharon to be the <i>Kohein Gadol</i>, and Moshe above him, for he taught him.

<b>We will not go up.</b> It is possible that the Tent of Meeting was located on high ground within the camp, and therefore it was appropriate to use the language “go up.” Alternatively, it can be explained that one who goes to the service of Hashem or to the chosen place is going up.

<b>If one man sins.</b> This refers to Korach, who congregated the entire congregation against Moshe and Aharon. Some hold the view that <b>Almighty, the God of the spirits </b>connotes that He has the power to search out a man’s spirit because He is his God, and He knows that one man alone, Korach, sinned, even if he caused others to sin.

Verse 28

To perform all of these deeds: i.e. transferring the duties of the firstborns unto the Leviim. And be aware that this is a serious matter. And it bothered them that they were no longer trusted to remove the firstborns from the Kohanim and give it all up to Moshe's family alone. All of this occurred during the sin of the Golden Calf for then they were seen as complete when they surpassed the firstborns who were worshiping since they were then the priests. And the Leviim killed the worshipers of the Calf. And there is here a question whose answer is in Parshas Vayeilech.

<b>Behold, a people that rises like a young lion.</b> This is a hint that they will conquer the Canaanite kings in a similar way, for example, as their victory against Midian which was unheard of. Not a single person from Israel was lost, five kings were killed, and the number of women captives who had not had relations with a man was thirty-two thousand.
<b>And drinks the blood of its kill.</b> The entire army and all the spoils. This verse could also be interpreted as: Moshe does not lie down until he devours his prey. Similarly, the verse says (31:2), Take revenge for Bnei Yisroel against the Midianites, afterwards, you shall be gathered to your people (die).

As in (Isaiah 22:5), "Mekarkar a wall." And its explanation is that he destroys a wall, as in (Isaiah 10:33), "He will hew off the tree-crowns with an ax."...
<b>The Children of Seth (Shet):</b> [This is] like the sons of Adam (all people), since [Seth] was the main [son of Adam], as Noah was from his descendants (such that everyone who lived afterwards was of the Children of Seth). And the Yitzchaki1 said that its understanding is [that it refers to] the Children of Ammon and also [the Children of] Moab, and its meaning is [hence] twofold. He also said that its usage [is like its usage in], "those with revealed shet" (Isaiah 11:3), which is a reference to the daughters of Lot (the mothers of Ammon and Moab). But that is distant [from the correct understanding] in my eyes; as shet is the posterior, which is like a foundation, as in (Psalms 11:3), "When the shatot are destroyed." And many understood, "all the children of shet" as the same usage as "When the shatot." And the explanation is that when he destroys the countries (which are like foundations). And this is not distant.

Additionally, in the Torah it is written (v. 58) “and the Korachite family” as well. Scripture mentioned the sons of Korach together with the sons of Reuven because all the sons of Dasan and Aviram died, even the minors. Thus, the evil that befell Dasan and Aviram was worse than that of Korach.

Verse 21



Chapter 28



Verse 1

<b>Command Bnei Yisroel.</b> The reason the section on offerings is placed here is because Hashem then asked Moshe to command Bnei Yisroel about the obligatory offerings, for he would not enter the Land with them. Scripture begins by mentioning the constant burnt-offering. Although it was mentioned earlier (Shemos 29:42), perhaps that mention was only on Mount Sinai; alternatively, it is mentioned here as well so that the entire system of offerings would be in order.

Chapter 29



Verse 1

This Sounding of the horn is a commandment.  If it were simply something that accompanied the offering, why would there be no mention of it on the other festivals?  Moreover, with regard to the offerings we are instructed to "sound the trumpets" (10:10) - not to sound the horn, for which a different Hebrew verb is used.

Chapter 30



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>The heads of the tribes:</b> According to my opinion that this section is after the war with Midian, it is for this reason that [the section about that war] is after it; just as "And Miriam and Aaron spoke about Moses (Numbers 12:1) is after "and they were in Chatserot" (Numbers 11:35) [even though it happened earlier], as I explained.1 And Scripture states that the Children of Gad came to Moses and Elazar and the princes of the congregation and they spoke their words. And afterwards, it is written (Numbers 32:28), "Then Moses gave instructions concerning them to Elazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the family heads of the Israelite tribes" - which are the princes of the congregation [just] mentioned. And since Moses said to the Children of Gad and the Children of Reuben (Numbers 32:24), "you shall do what comes out of your mouth"; it is therefore written (Numbers 30:2), "And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes," and then (verse 3), "he shall do like everything that comes out of his mouth."
