And the explanation of "AND HE HEARD": That he alone heard The Voice and it was not heard by anybody else who was in the Tent of Gathering outside of the curtain. This is also correct because Hashem added to his (Moses's) feeling in his ears (ability to hear) just as He had added light to the eyes of the blind Elisha and thus likewise revealed to the eyes of Bilam

And it bothered them that they were no longer trusted to remove the firstborns from the Kohanim and give it all up to Moshe's family alone. All of this occurred during the sin of the Golden Calf for then they were seen as complete when they surpassed the firstborns who were worshiping since they were then the priests. And the Leviim killed the worshipers of the Calf. And there is here a question whose answer is in Parshas Vayeilech.
