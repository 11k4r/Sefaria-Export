Kitzur Baal Haturim on Numbers



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>These are the names of the sons of Aharon, the firstborn, Nadav, and Avihu, Elazar and Isamar</b>. There is a pause between the words “the firstborn” and “Nadav” because it does not refer to Nadav who died without children, and there is no practical ramification of his being the firstborn. Rather, it refers to Aharon who was the firstborn ahead of Moshe.

Verse 23

..."Thus shall you bless" - the word thus (Heb. koh) comes to remind us of the merit of the verse "the boy and I will walk thus far" (Gen. 22) and also "thus shall be your offspring" and also "thus The LORD has blessed me."  The two letters that comprise the word "thus" in Hebrew, kaf and hey, make 25 and there are 25 letters in the Shema, the word blessing appears 25 times in the Torah and also the word peace appears 25 times.  This is why the Priestly Blessing starts and finishes with the word peace and that is the meaning of "The LORD will bless His people with peace."
