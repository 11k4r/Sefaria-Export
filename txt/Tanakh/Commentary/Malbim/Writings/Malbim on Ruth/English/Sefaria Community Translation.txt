Verse 8

How are they judging you here? To your merit! Therefore, do not go to reap in another field, where the owner might not be willing to let you. And do not go away from here, even among my fields (for Boaz had many fields), where the men might hate you. More so, stay close to my girls, because on this field there are men on one side, and women on another. Stay on the side of the women.
