Verse 4

The wife of Lappidoth. That is to say, a woman of valor, zealous in her deeds as a torch afire. And this a matter of figurative language, as when it is said about a person. 
She judged. On account that she was a prophet and zealous in her deeds, this elevated status came to her; thus, she was judging Israel.

<b>And he did to her [as he had vowed]</b>. She separated from human company to live alone, busy with the worship of God. And our teachers of blessed memory have said (Ta'anit 4a) that he vowed to sacrifice as a burnt offering all that came out of his house, and so he performed his vow. 
<b>And she had not known a man</b> It wishes to say, as he had vowed, so she had done, and she had separated from men.
