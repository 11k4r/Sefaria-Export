<b>And Samuel:</b> ... This is a customary usage [found] in many places. And homiletically: Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Yose ben Zimrah, "Even Samuel, the teacher of the prophets, prophesies and does not know what he prophesies, as it is stated, 'And the Lord sent Yerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel'... since he did not know what he was prophesying."
