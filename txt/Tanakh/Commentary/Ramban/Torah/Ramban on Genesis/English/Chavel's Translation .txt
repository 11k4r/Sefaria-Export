Verse 1

This is the book of the generations of Adam:
These are the children He will mention in the chapter. In my opinion, this alludes to the entire Torah, for the entire Torah "is the book of the generations of Adam". Therefore, He says here "book" and does not say, "And these are the generations of Adam," as He says in other places, e.g. "And these are the generations of Ishmael" (Genesis 25:12); "And these are the generations of Isaac (Genesis 25:19), and so on in all such cases.
