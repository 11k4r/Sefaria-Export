Rashi on Amos



Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Who was in (the) Nokdim: </b> And Targum Yonatan translates it as: "Master of Sheep", just as Mesha, the King of Moab, was a "Noked" (Melachim 2, 3).
<b> Two years before the earthquake: </b> Two years before King Uzziah died, on the day that Isaiah (Isaiah 6) prophesied "And the foundations shall be shaken." It is referenced by Zechariah (Zechariah 14) when he says "Just as you had fled from the earthquake."

For instance, Isaiah and Amos prophesied on the destruction of Sennacherib, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel prophesied on the destruction of Nebuchadnezzar.

swore by Himself – consciously and with intention: 
I abhor – This means abhor (even though it is written with an aleph and not an ayin.) This is how Yonatan translated it into Aramaic ‘I despise the great Holy Temple of Yaakov.’ He calls it this because the Temple is called the pride of their strength, as it says “Behold I am profaning My sanctuary, the pride of your strength…” (Ezekiel 24:21): 
the city and the fullness thereof  - Jerusalem and its inhabitants:
