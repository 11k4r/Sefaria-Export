Therefore behold I will seduce her…I will persuade or appease her to draw her after me. And what is the seduction and the leading into the wilderness?  Exile which will be like a wilderness and a draught to her, and there she will do tshuvah (return her heart) for it is better when she does My will than when she rebels against Me.”
