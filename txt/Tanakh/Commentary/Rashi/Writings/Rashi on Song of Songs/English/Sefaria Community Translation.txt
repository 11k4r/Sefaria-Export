Rashi on Song of Songs



Chapter 1



Verse 1

...The Amorim in the Song of Songs made holy the King so that he will have his peace, the Song is above all the songs that we say...100 of his people and his people the House of Israel. Said Rabbi Akiva, "If there was nothing in the world of worth today, Song of Songs was given into it for Israel, for all the Writings are holy, and the Song of Songs is the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Eleazar ben Ezriah, "Why do the things appear for the King that grasps...

Verse 7

1. Tell me, you whom my soul loves - Now the Holy Spirit returns and compares her to sheep which are beloved to the shepherd. Israel says before God like a woman to her husband: tell me whom my soul loves, how can you pasture your sheep among these wolves and how can you let them rest in the afternoon, in this exile, which is a difficult time for them just as afternoon is a difficult time for the sheep.
2. For why should I be like one who strays - And if you should say what do you care, it's not your honor (at stake)? Should I be like a mourner wrapped on edge, crying over her sheep?
3. Beside the flocks of your fellows - at the flocks of the rest of the shepherds who are shepherds like you, that is to say, between the mounds of nations that trust in other gods and have kings and rulers leading them.

Verse 8

1. If you don't know - that is the answer of the shepherd.  If you don't know where you are going to go to pasture your sheep, the fairest of women, that the shepherd has ceased leading them.
2. Follow the path of the sheep - I looked at their steps to see where the flocks went, and their tracks are called traichit in Old French, and so too in many places in scripture (Psalm 77)  "And your tracks could not be seen" and (Jeremiah 13) "your limbs exposed" and (Gen. 49) "But he shall raid at their heels," and that is the way you should go.
3. And graze your kids by the tent of the shepherds - between the settlements of the other shepherds where you are.  And this is the allegory: if you don't know, my congregation and my people are the fairest of women among the nations, how shall you be pastured and saved from those who oppress you, to be among them and not be lost, my children observe the ways of your first ancestors who received my Torah and safeguard my keepsakes and commandments and walk in their ways.  And even with that reward you graze your kids at the ministers of nations and thus says Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31) "Erect markers, Set up signposts; Keep in mind the highway, The road that you traveled. Return, Maiden Israel!, etc."

1 Los brotes se mostraron en la tierra. Después de Moshé y Aharón, estaban listos para ustedes y para todas sus necesidades.
2 El tiempo del canto llegó. En el futuro de ustedes se dirá el cántico del mar.
3 La voz de la tórtola. Una gran conmoción turística, después de eso vendrá la voz de la tórtola, una voz que llega al tiempo de vuestra salida de Egipto. (12) Los brotes se mostrarán en la tierra, se acercarán días de calor, los árboles se retirarán y las flores saldrán en los caminos peatonales para deleitarlos.
4 El tiempo del canto llegó. Las aves se darán al canto y la voz de la tarde será el andar de las personas. ...
5 Y la voz de la tórtola. Literalmente significa que las tórtolas, las palomas y las aves saldrán al camino a cantar como poetas en los días de Pésaj.
