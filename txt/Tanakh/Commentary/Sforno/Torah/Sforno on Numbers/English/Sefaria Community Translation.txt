You will see it, and you will remember all the mitzvot - you will be reminded that you are God’s servants whose commandments you have accepted reinforced by oaths known as אלה (alah) and (shevuah) שבועה. This reminder will be due to your looking at the “fringes” that may be viewed as if their king had placed a stamp on your bodies confirming that the wearer is one of his subjects. 
After your eyes - to object to the urge of which you put your eyes on.
That you lust after them - it diverts  your rational souls from the paths of life eternal to the paths of destruction and death.
