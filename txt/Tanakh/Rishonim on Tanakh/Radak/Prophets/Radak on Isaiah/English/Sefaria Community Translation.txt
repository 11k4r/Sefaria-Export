Verse 7

[He must abandon his way] in deed and speech, so too he must abandon his wicked thoughts, for repentance will not be effective with regard to the visible [aspects of sin] if it does not also target the hidden [aspect of sin, i.e. thoughts]. For the good and bad actions of man are dependent upon the hand, mouth, and heart, and repentance is required from all of them.
