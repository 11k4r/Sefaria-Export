"Before the water..." - He went in before they came.  And we don't know the reason why he says in his interpretation that he was of little faith.  Because the text testifies that he was righteous and pure and that he did everything God commanded!

"And kiss me". And he did not say "And I will kiss you". Kissing always depends on the greater party who kisses someone of lesser status. When they are equal each one kisses his fellow as in "And each man kissed his friend". Rather he said so (kiss me) because Yitzchak could not see Yaakov and was not able to kiss only to feel. Therefore he told his son to kiss him.

The eyes of Leah were soft: She was beautiful, but her eyes were soft and teary,
But Rachel was of beautiful form and fair to look upon, without any blemish. And "form" refers to the shape of the face and the rest of the body, the posture, and skin color which was write and red (pink), and the hair was dark.
