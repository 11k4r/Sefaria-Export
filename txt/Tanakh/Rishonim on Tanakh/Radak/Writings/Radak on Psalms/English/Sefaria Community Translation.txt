Magdil ["{God} magnifies"] salvations. Magdil, and in the Book of (II) Samuel (22:51), [it is written as] migdol ["a tower"], and it is a descriptor--but the idea is one [and the same].

Girded with might: He does not acquire His might from someone else when He needs it; rather, He shows His might at any time He wishes, for the might is His girdle.

Verse 8



Verse 9



To my understanding, these two verses speak about Israel. "He who quieted the raging waters before Israel," who split the sea and brought them through its midst, "He will quiet the multitude of nations" and their raging, and will bring up Israel from their midst. Just as those who live at the ends of the earth saw the signs You made for them at the Parting of the Sea of Reeds -- as it says (Exodus.15.14) "Nations heard, they were frightened" -- so too, at the ingathering of exiles, they will be afraid of You and awed by Your signs once again. And just as You caused their hearts to shout for joy by "bringing out morning and evening" (Exodus.13.22) 'a pillar of cloud each day and a pillar of fire at night,' You will do the same for them at the ingathering of exiles.

Verse 2

Good [It is good to praise the Name]: The Sabbath Day is better for praising the Name than the other days of the week.  For one is free of the business of the world and one's spirit rests from physical troubles.   The spirit occupies itself in Wisdom and the service of God.  And it is good to say [praise] to your name, O Exalted one.  For the exalted soul finds an opportunity to praise You, who are Exalted.

Verse 1

LET US GO: This is what Israel is saying to each other in the days of the Messiah, to sing to the Lord that redeemed them. And we have already explained that “lechu” are words of ziruz (alacrity/enthusiasm) in the action, not literally walking.

FORTY [years] that they angered me from the matter with the Spies until I said that they would remain in the desert for forty years. אקוט means “I saw them rebel”, and בדור refers to the generation of the desert.
The mistake of their hearts and their hearts are negative so they didn't believe in Me.
They did not recognize all the miracles that I made for them, and they feared entering the Land. They did not trust in me. Therefore I swore that they would not enter there [Israel] and and die in the desert from 20 years and up.

1 "because [they defied the statements of God, spurned the intent of the Most High]."  [The Psalmist] informed them that they were taken captive on account of their iniquity, for they had "defied the statements/'imrei of God," which refers to the precepts that He had commanded to humanity.  It was not to Israel alone that commandments were issued, but also to all peoples.  He distinguished Israel from the (other) nations by commanding them concerning additional precepts, sanctifying them through the purity of body and food.  However, traditional precepts were granted to the first Man and his progeny (i.e., the Seven Noachide Laws).  These are "the statements of God."

Verse 1

There are manuscripts [of the book of Psalms] in which this verse [115:1] is not the beginning of the psalm. [In other words, those manuscripts join together Psalms 114 and 115.]. [The Psalmist] said that, just as You have performed acts of lovingkindness for our ancestors by taking them out of Egypt, so may you do for us in every generation.  Even though we are not worthy, do not do so 'for us' (115:1) but for your Name's sake.  For they [the generation of the Exodus] likewise would not have been worthy had it not been for the glory of Your name and [Your] covenant with the Fathers.  He says "not for our sake" twice in order to emphasize the point.

[Adonai] is good to all.  He is good and merciful even to wild animals, domesticated animals, and fowl.  And so it is fitting for a person to follow these ways of His.  One should not destroy life other than for a need or to guard oneself from dangers.  So we find that our Holy Master (Rabbi Judah the Prince, editor of the Mishnah) bade his handmaiden not to sweep up mice with household embers.  Rather, she should let them live in the cellar.  He said to her, "It is written, 'His mercy is upon all His works.'"
