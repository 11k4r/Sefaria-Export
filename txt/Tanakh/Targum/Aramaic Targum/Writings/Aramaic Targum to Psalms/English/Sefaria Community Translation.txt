Aramaic Targum to Psalms



Chapter 1

Happy the man who has not walked in the council of the wicked, or stood in the paths of sinners, or taken a seat in the band of mockers.
Instead his pleasure is in the law of the Lord, and in his Torah he meditates day and night. 
And he will be like a living tree planted by streams of water, whose fruit ripens in due course, and its leaves do not fall, and all its branches that grow ripen and flourish.
Not so the wicked; instead, they are like the chaff that the storm-wind will drive.
Therefore the wicked will not be acquitted in the great day, nor sinners in the band of the righteous, 
Because the path of the righteous is manifest in the Lord’s presence, but the paths of the wicked will perish.

Chapter 2

Why are the nations disturbed, and murmuring vanity?
The kings of the earth arise and the rulers will join together to rebel in the Lord’s presence, and to strive against His Anointed.
They say, “Let us break their bonds, and let us throw off their chains from us.”
The One Who sits in Heaven will laugh; the word of the Lord will mock at them.
Then He will speak to them in His strength, and in His wrath He will frighten them.
"And I have anointed My king, and appointed him over My Sanctuary."
I will tell of the covenant of the Lord. He said: “You are as dear to Me as a son to a father, pure as if this day I had created you.”
"Ask Me and I will give the spoils of nations as your inheritance, the rulers of the ends of the earth as your holding."
"You will shatter them as with a rod of iron, like a potter’s vessel you will break them."
And now, O kings, grow wise; accept discipline, O princes of the earth.
Worship in the presence of the Lord with fear, and pray with trembling.
Accept instruction lest He be angry, and you lose your way; for His wrath will tarry a little. Happy all who trust in His Word!

Chapter 3

A psalm of David, when he fled from the presence of Absalom his son.
Lord, how many are my oppressors, many who arise against me!
Many say to my soul, “There is no redemption for him in God forever.”
But you, Lord, are a shield over me, my glory and the one who raises my head.
I pray, my voice in the presence of the Lord; He will accept my prayer from the Mount of His Holy Temple forever.
I lay down, and I slept; I awoke, because the Lord sustains me.
I will not be afraid of the myriads of people who have gathered against me all around.
Arise, O Lord, redeem me, O my God; for you have struck all my enemies on their cheek, you have broken the teeth of the wicked.
Redemption is from the presence of the Lord; your blessings are to your people forever.

Chapter 4

 For praise, with melodies: A hymn of David
At the time of my prayer, accept it from me, O God of my righteousness; at the time of distress, you relieved me; pity me and accept my prayer.
Sons of men, why is my glory for humiliation? You will love vanity; you will seek falsehood forever.
And they will know, for the Lord has separated the righteous man for Himself; the Lord will accept the prayer of David when he calls to Him.
Tremble for Him, and do not sin; utter your petition with your mouth and your request in your heart; and pray upon your beds and remember the days of death forever.
Subdue your impulses and it will be reckoned to you as a righteous sacrifice; and hope in the Lord.
Many say, “Who will show us good?” Lift on us the light of your countenance, O Lord
You have placed joy in my heart when their grain and their wine has increased.
In peace I both lay down and sleep, because you alone are the Lord; in security you will make me dwell.

The boy the builders rejected; he was among the sons of Jesse and he was privileged to be appointed as king and ruler.
"This is from YHWH," said the builders; "It is marvelous before us," said the sons of Jesse.
"This is the day YHWH made [or acted]," said the builders; "Let us rejoice and be glad in it," said the sons of Jesse.
"Please, from you, O YHWH, now!" said the builders; "Please, from you, O YHWH, cause [us] to prosper, now!" said Jesse and his wife.
"Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the word of YHWH," said [the] builders; "They bless you from the house of the sanctuary of YHWH," said David.
"YHWH is God; he caused [light] to shine for us," said the tribes of the house of Judah; "Bind the lamb for the sacrifice of the feast with ropes until you offer him and you sprinkle his blood on the horns of the altar," said Samuel the prophet.
