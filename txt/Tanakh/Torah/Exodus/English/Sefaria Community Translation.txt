Chapter 26

And the tabernacle (the mishkan) shall you make with ten curtains [to serve it as a roof and as partitions outside the boards, the curtains being hung behind them to cover them]: twisted linen (shesh) and blue (wool) and purple and scarlet, [four varieties in each thread, one of linen and three of wool and each thread twisted six (shesh) times, giving a twenty-four-fold thread], cherubs of artistic work [(figures interwoven on both sides)] shall you make them.
	The length of one curtain, twenty-eight cubits; and the width, four cubits for one curtain — one measure for all the curtains.
	Five curtains shall be attached [by sewing] one to the other, and five curtains, one to the other.
	And you shall make loops of purple wool at the edge of the end curtain of one (five-curtain) joining, and, likewise, at the edge of the end curtain of the other joining.
	Fifty loops shall you make in the one (end) curtain, and fifty loops shall you make at the edge of the (end) curtain in the second joining, the loops [on the respective joinings] directly aligned one with the other.
	And you shall make fifty golden hooks, and you shall join the curtains one to the other by the hooks, [inserting one end of the hook into one loop, and the other end, into its corresponding loop], and the tabernacle shall be one.
	And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to tent over the [lower curtains of the] tabernacle; eleven curtains shall you make them.
	The length of one curtain, thirty cubits; and the width, four cubits for one curtain — one measure for the eleven curtains.
	And you shall join five curtains separately and six curtains separately, and you shall double [two cubits of] the sixth curtain [the "surplus" vis-à-vis the lower curtains] over the face of the tent [the screen on the east (as a bride's face is veiled in modesty)].
	And you shall make fifty loops at the edge of the end curtain in (one) joining, and fifty loops at the edge of the curtain in the second joining.
	And you shall make fifty copper hooks, and you shall insert the hooks into the loops, and you shall join the tent [the goats' hair covering], and it shall be one.
	And the additional draping in the curtains of the tent, half of the additional curtain [i.e., two cubits], you shall hang over the back [the west] of the tabernacle [to cover the two cubits of exposed beams.]
	And the cubit on one side and the cubit on the other side in excess [of the length of the lower curtains] in the length of the curtains of the tent, shall be spread over both sides [north and south] of the tabernacle [curtains] to cover it [(for purposes of adornment)].
	And you shall make a cover for the tent [(the goats' hair roof)] of rams' skins dyed red, and a cover of tachash skins above.
	And you shall make the beams of the tabernacle [those that have been designated for the purpose (Jacob, prophetically, having planted acacia trees to this end)] of standing acacia wood. [The beams of the tabernacle walls are to be stood up vertically, and not placed horizontally one atop the other.]
	Ten cubits the length of the beam [(so that the height of the tabernacle was ten cubits)], and a cubit and a half the breadth of each beam [(so that the length of the tabernacle was thirty cubits)].
	Two prongs (wooden projections) for each beam [(the beam being hollowed out at the bottom to form these prongs)], rung-like, one near the other [like the rungs of a ladder]. So shall you do for all the beams of the tabernacle.
	And you shall make the beams for the tabernacle, twenty beams for the southern side.
	And forty silver sockets shall you make under the twenty beams; two sockets under one beam for its two prongs, and two sockets under the next beam for its two prongs.
	And for the second side of the tabernacle, the northern side, twenty beams.
	And their forty silver sockets, two sockets under one beam and two sockets under the next beam.
	And for the ends [i.e., the back] of the tabernacle on the west, you shall make six beams, [accounting for nine cubits of width.]
	And two beams shall you make for the corners of the tabernacle at the ends, [(so that the interior width is ten cubits)].
	And they (the beams) shall be fitted against each other at the bottom, and together shall they be fitted at its top into one ring. [Two adjacent beams were fixed together by a ring placed in grooves along their breadth.] So shall it be for the two of them [for the two beams at the end, the beam at the northern end and the western beam, and so,] for the two corners shall they be.
	And [on the western side] there shall be eight beams and their silver sockets, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one beam and two sockets under the next beam.
	And you shall make bars of acacia wood, five for the beams of one side of the tabernacle [These "five" are three, the upper and lower bars, respectively, consisting of two equal (fifteen cubit segments) running along the side wall, and one bar running the entire length through a hole bored in each beam.]
	And five bars for the beams of the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the beams of the side of the tabernacle at the western ends.
	And the middle bar in the midst of the beams shall extend from end to end.
	And the beams shall you cover with gold, and their rings shall you make of gold [to serve as] housings for the bars, and you shall cover the bars with gold [i.e., They will be "covered" with gold when they are inserted into the golden rings flanked by the golden half-reeds on either side.]
	And you shall set up the tabernacle after the manner which will have been shown to you [by the L rd] in the mountain.
	And you shall make a parocheth (partition) of blue wool and purple wool and scarlet wool and twisted linen. Artistic work shall he make it, cherubs. [See Rashi on verse 1].
	And you shall place it on four pillars of acacia wood covered with gold, their hooks of gold [(Hooks bent upwards were set in the pillars on which to place the pole on which the top of the parocheth was wrapped)] (the pillars standing) upon four sockets of silver.
	And you shall put the parocheth under the hooks, and you shall bring there, inside the parocheth, the ark of testimony; and the parocheth shall separate for you between the holy and the holy of holies.
	And you shall put the kaporeth (the lid) upon the ark of testimony in the holy of holies.
	And you shall place the table outside the parocheth, and the menorah opposite the table on the southern side of the tabernacle; and the table shall you place on the northern side.
And you shall make a screen [a curtain] for the entrance of the tent, of blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer [needlework, the figures on one side being the same as those on the other.]
	And you shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia wood, and you shall cover them with gold, and their hooks (shall be) of gold; and you shall cast for them five copper sockets.
