Tosefta Berakhot

Chapter 1
















Similarly (a name was returned to its original), “His tabernacle was in Shalem, and His dwelling place in Zion.” And why did the verse see fit to give her back her original name? Because it says “For this city has aroused My anger and My wrath since the day they built it until this day, to remove it from before My face,” (Jeremiah 32:31) perhaps even now she is (seen) in wrath and anger? But another verse states “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling…” (Tehillim 68:17) behold she is cherished and desired! This teaches that her destruction brought her atonement. And from where do we learn that the Divine Presence will not return in her until she becomes a mountain (again)? It says “His Tabernacle was in Shalem…” we find that when it is whole she is called a mountain (by David before any building). But the Divine Presence will not return in her until she is made a mountain (again). It says “And Avraham called that name of that place the Lord will see, as it is said to this day: On the mountain, the Lord will be seen.” (Bereshit 22:14) And it says “Remember, O Lord, for the sons of Edom, the day of Jerusalem…” when (will the Divine Presence return)? When her foundations have been uprooted from her. “…those who say, "Raze it, raze it, down to its foundation!"
