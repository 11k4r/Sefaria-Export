Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4










In the early days, they would say, "One may not pickle and one may not dry [produce in order to preserve it], and one may not import dried or pickled produce from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel." [Thereafter,] our Masters permitted people to pickle and dry [produce], and that dried and pickled produce be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel. [In the early days,] vegetables could not be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel, [but thereafter,] our Masters permitted vegetables to be imported from outside the Land of Israel into the Land of Israel. And just as they imported vegetables from outside the Land of Israel, so too they imported grains and beans (<i>kitniyot</i>) from outside the Land of Israel into Israel. Rebbi and his Beit Din [even] permitted one to purchase vegetables immediately after the conclusion of the sabbatical year. (Note: This translation follows Lieberman.)
Seventh-year produce that entered the Land of Israel: One may not sell them, either by measure, or by weight, or by quantity; rather, behold, they are like produce of the Land of Israel.



It so happened with Rabbi Akiva that he picked an etrog on the first of Shevat and he conducted himself like the words of Beit Shammai and like the words of Beit Hillel as to [the etrog]. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda says, "like the words of <i>Rabban Gamaliel</i> and like the words of <i>Rabbi Eliezer</i>." Said Rabbi Yosei, "Rabbi Avtilas testified in the name of five Elders that the tithing of an etrog goes according to when it is picked. And our Masters voted on it, and they said in Usha that [for purposes of the sabbatical year,] an etrog goes according to when it is picked, both as to tithes and as to removal."

Chapter 5



Chapter 6








One may not spice seventh-year oil, but one may purchase spiced oil in order to apply it anywhere [on one's skin]. Seventh-year oil may not be used [as a kindling agent] on firewood.
One may not sell seventh-year produce, either by measure or by quantity, or by weight, and one may not fill up a barrel [with wine] and sell it as is, [or] a basket [with produce] and sell it as is; rather, he says to him (i.e., to the buyer), "This barrel I will sell to you for a dinar," [or] "This basket I will sell to you for a tressis" (such that the buyer is ostensibly paying only for the barrel or the basket, and not for the seventh-year produce).
One may not fill up a basket and go out and sell it in the marketplace [during the sabbatical year]. Even in the other years of the cycle it is forbidden, for this is the custom of the Romans.
Beit Shammai say, one may not sell seventh-year produce for money, rather only for [other] produce, so that he will not buy a spade with [the money], but Beit Hillel permits it. One may not sell seventh-year produce to someone who is suspected of [transgressing] the sabbatical year -- [one may sell him] only enough food for three meals. <i>In what case does this apply?</i> Where [the produce] is something that will last for a long time, but [if it is] not something that will not last long, even one hundred meals is permitted.  
One may neither sell nor purchase seventh-year produce from a Samaritan or from a Gentile. Other says, one may sell to a Samaritan up to four issars [worth of seventh-year produce]. 
One who purchases a loaf of bread worth a pundion from a baker and [in order to satisfy the debt] says to him, "I will harvest [this] field of vegetables and bring [the produce] to you," it is permitted. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Nehemiah forbid it.

Chapter 7



Chapter 8

At first, the agents of the court would sit at the entrances of the towns: They would take the produce from anyone who would bring it in his hand; and they would give [back] to him, food for three meals. They would then store the remainder in the town storehouse. 
When the time of [harvesting] the figs arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would then pick] them, make them into dried fig cakes and store them in the town storehouse. When the time of [harvesting] the grapes arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would] then reap them, crush them in the vat, place them into barrels and store them in the town storehouse. When the time of [harvesting] the olives arrived, the agents of the court would hire workers. [The workers would] then harvest them, press them in the olive press, place them into barrels and store them in the town storehouse. And on the eve of Shabbat, they would distribute from them [to] each and every one according to [the size of] his household.
When the time of the elimination (<i>biur</i>) arrived, poor people are allowed to eat [seventh year produce] after the elimination, but not wealthy people. [These are] the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yose says, "It is is the same for poor people and the same for wealthy people - they are allowed to eat after the elimination." Rabbi Shimon says, "Wealthy people are [only] allowed to eat from the storehouse after the elimination.
[In the case of] one who has produce of the seventh year: When the time of the elimination arrives, he can distribute [as much as he can] of it to his neighbors, his relatives and his acquaintances. He then places [the remainder] at [the entrance of] his house and says, "Our brothers, House of Israel: Anyone who needs to take, let him come and take!" He then stores it [back] in his house, and may continue to eat until when it is finished.
A debt to a shop is canceled by the sabbatical year, the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Sages say, it is not canceled (Sheviit 10:1). Said Rebbi, the words of Rabbi Yehuda are preferable as to one with a monetary debt, and the words of the Sages as to a debt [to be repaid with] produce.
